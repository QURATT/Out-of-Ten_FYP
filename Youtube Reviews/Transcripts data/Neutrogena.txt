"hi people welcome back to my youtube
channel this is nanny desai it's
officially christmas season over here
and you are gonna see this
christmas tree for rest of the video and
rest of the holiday season
and if i'm too lazy to take it down
until january so i guess in the videos
of january 2
so i can't help with it and i suck at
decorating trees so yeah
don't judge me for that so in today's
video we are going to review new to
china ultra share
dry touch sunblock with spf 50 plus we
are gonna
point out everything that has been
included in this sunscreen
and how does it actually works and is it
actually dry touch or not
okay so i've been using it for like one
year now it's it's a very nice product
but it has its own
drawbacks okay so first of all the one
thing that i love about this product is
that it's
water resistant and it's sweat resistant
it's the summer season i
am looking for sunscreens which are
sweat resistant and water resistant and
secondly it won't clog your pores
so i think it's a very nice thing that
it won't clog our pores
since if you are doing makeup or if you
are carrying other serums and stuff so
you need a sunscreen that won't clog
your pores moving on to the third point
it's oil free and it's paraben free now
talking about its
spf spf is our 50 and i think that's
this is the main point which
i see in a sunscreen that it's spf
should be above 50
then only i move on to seeing other
points because if the spf is lower than
50
the sunscreen is probably not of use
also it's stabilized with helioplex
which is that
it will provide protection from both uva
and uvb rays
as the content says it says that it's
dry touch sunlock as you can read it's
dry touch
sunblock i think it's actually dried out
but
i don't know if it's because of my skin
care or um
about what it does not feel as dry
i mean i've used la shield before and
this uh this is a slightly more
hydrating and
more gives more shine to my face which
is a plus point for me
so if you have somebody if you're if
you're having oily skin and if you
really want to
look for a sunscreen which has dry touch
i think this is not the one
because this provides a very nice shine
to my face this is um
not greasy exactly but it's really
moisturizing
and it really hydrates my skin because
this is not exactly matte
or dry touch i don't know why they have
included in it or it's just my skin that
it shines on my it brings a glow to my
skin
every skin is different so i just tried
it on my skin i've been using it for one
year but
yes it does give a very nice glow to my
skin as soon as i put it
my face glows differently i mean
i don't need a serum underneath it i do
not put anything underneath it when i'm
going out
even if i'm home this is the only
product which
which is the only sunscreen which is
non-greasy but
also gives a very nice shine so i think
if you're somebody
if you're somebody with dry skin or
combination skin i think it's a very
nice try for you
all your skin types can use it in
winters so it's not exactly dry touch
uh on my skin so you can try it out
yourself
so if you're somebody with oily skin i
would recommend uh
going with la shield or any sun cross
spf 50
or any such sunscreens but not this one
because those are really
really dry touch not this one you should
apply every sunscreen 30 to 40 minutes
before the sun exposure
so i think which is applicable you can
reapply the sunscreen after every five
to six hours depending on
how much you're staying into the sun if
you're somebody with issues like
freckles or pigmentation you should use
it even if you're staying at home
because lights from our um phone screens
our tv screens our laptops are also very
very harmful
for your skin and you should use a
sunscreen
even if you are not stepping out so
that's like a rule
so yeah i'd rate it again 9 out of 10
because it is so amazing
so overall i give 9 out of 10 to the
sunscreen because
one point that i noticed was that claims
to have
like a non shiny finish and it claims
that it won't bring
any type of shine on your face it's a
dry touch but it's
not exactly a dry touch it really brings
a very nice shine to my face
which i take it as a plus point for
myself but i don't know
but in general uh that's that could be a
plus point for some of you and that
could not be a plus point for some of
you
so yeah if you have oily skin you can
definitely go for this one
in winters but you have dry skin or
combination skin you can go
you can go with this throughout the
season so like for 12 months you
this is your goat this can be your go-to
sunscreen and i love this sunscreen
i think i would highly recommend it
thank you all for watching this was it

it for today and i'll see you in my next
video bye
Neutrogena sunscreen review for this summer
Hey guys! Welcome to my channel. Today I'm going to review and test two sunscreens
from Neutrogena: the sensitive skin one and the ultra sheer- dry touch.
Let's compare these at the same time.
I'm going to start with Neutrogena sensitive
skin sunscreen. As you can see, the consistency of the sensitive skin it's
very heavy and takes longer to absorb. One thing that I noticed, this is a
sunblock, so use it after your moisturizer.
Personally, I don't like it, it's kind of messy and greasy and you can keep white
residue in some parts of my face, even if I try my best to spread it well.
In general, this sunblock is not my favorite and I don't recommend it to use it on
your face, if you have acne or oily skin.
My next review will be the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer
Dry-touch. I can tell you how lightweight this sunscreen is, after I
apply it on my face (as you can see), looks and feels very clean, no white residue and my
skin does not get oily at all. Also absorbs very fast.
Reading about the active ingredients, the Neutrogena ultra sheer
is a chemical sunscreen, this means
you have to apply this sunscreen before your moisturizer and wait about 15
minutes before any sun exposure.
In my opinion, I totally recommend this one for
people with oily skin and acne problems. In general, I'm very satisfied about this
sunscreen.
And here you have the final review about these two Neutrogena
sunscreens.
Anyways! This is all I have for today
Thank you so much for watching! I hope you guys subscribe!
Thumbs up if you like this video!
And leave me a comment about your favorite Neutrogena sunscreen.
Mine is the Ultra Sheer! See you guys next time!
Pura Vida!??????
hello and welcome back to my channel i
have my headband on so i can apply a
sunscreen
and see how it goes i
think i maybe have applied this
sunscreen once but i haven't really used
it
um this is the neutrogena sensitive skin
mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 60
plus
um this has titanium dioxide and zinc
oxide in it
it doesn't really make any claims about
being sheer
um it is supposed to be for sensitive
skin
which honestly is probably better with a
mineral sunscreen because i feel like
those are the ones where i see
the most somewhat ridiculous claims
um i do have my quarter teaspoon so
um for your face you are
supposed to use a quarter teaspoon of
sunscreen
um is the general recommendation got a
little bit too much so that's about a
quarter teaspoon
you're recommended to put another
quarter teaspoon
on your neck and ears you don't want to
forget
those areas and also around your eyes
the amount of sunscreen you're supposed
to use to get the
spf on the bottle i believe is two
milligrams per centimeter squared
i feel like i should look that up so
that i make sure that i'm actually
saying the correct amount
but that's what i think it is
so with a non-tinted mineral sunscreen
generally i expect
there to be some type of white cast i
suppose um
since i do have a fair skin tone i
guess it is more likely that i can have
it blend into my skin
okay i got it all out of there this is
the extra that i
wiped off at the beginning
and honestly i might have a smaller face
than the quarter teaspoon
like recommendation is technically four
um
but for the purposes of video i wanted
to
show you what a quarter teaspoon looks
like
since that is the recommended amount
of sunscreen to use
and i'm just gonna rub this in for a
little while and then i'll probably let
it sit
for a little bit to see if it does sink
in at all
it is um like a nice
lotiony texture it has maybe a little
bit of a sunscreen scent
um but it's not like hard to rub around
or anything like that um
i don't feel it's starting to pill um
okay so that's the sunscreen on my face
i can definitely tell that some is on my
hands so
um that's something to keep in mind when
you're applying sunscreen is
um you know you want to get enough on
your face if you're applying it with
your hands like you probably are
um some is likely going to be on your
hands so that's part of the thing that
you want to keep in mind when you're
thinking about how much you're applying
um so again like i said a quarter
teaspoon might be a little bit much for
me um
i don't know it's hard to know exactly
how big my face is
um but i do really enjoy a lab muffin
beauty science i think is her channel
and she's actually like measured her
face and i think she found that she
needs less than a quarter teaspoon
by quite a fair amount so if you do have
a smaller face
or like a similar face size to that
i think that it's reasonable to assume
that the amount that ends up on your
hands
from rubbing it in may kind of cover for
the amount that you don't need on your
face
um but regardless it's always probably
better to
lean towards a little bit more than a
little bit less but she's all
she's also talked about that as well
obviously the best sunscreen is one that
you'll wear
and applying too much can potentially
cause a problem as well
um just because you know you're wasting
money at some point um
by applying too much sunscreen and
you're losing some of that um cosmetic
elegance of it sitting on your skin
so that may make you more or may make
you less likely to
use it um and i know she did a whole
video talking about like why you
shouldn't apply
too much sunscreen either and i can't
off the top of my head think about the
other things that she
discussed um i don't know if it's
potentially more likely for it to like
transfer off your face if you have too
much on your face
um but um here's the extra amount that i
didn't apply to my face because i
overfilled the
teaspoon so
it's definitely like a nice texture i
think if i
could rub it in with like a little bit
less rubbing in um it would keep a
little bit of a nicer texture because
it's
it almost gets a little bit more it
almost loses some of its elegance as you
rub it in i can't describe exactly how
so there is it
my two hands for comparisons you can
kind of see
the white cast on my hand um there
definitely is a little bit there for me
it's kind of like a pinkish
tint that i think is there on my skin
so straight off the bat
i don't know if this is a nano
zinc oxide or not in it
but the white cast doesn't look that bad
for an spf 60 plus
mineral only sunscreen um obviously like
this isn't a good like it's not good to
have white gas
but um it's not the worst
that i've seen i'm going to let it sink
in for a little bit i'm going to go
check the mirror and see if i have any
like streaks that i need to blend a
little bit better
and then i will come back and see what
it looks like in about like 10
15 minutes to see if there's any fading
of the white cast in that amount of time
okay so i have given this about 15
minutes to
kind of do its thing see if the white
cast
did dissipate at all and i went and got
a mirror
so this definitely does still have a
white cast
i think the areas that are the worst
i mean my hairline um so you know maybe
more caution when you're blending there
yeah i mean it's just kind of a general
layer of a
a light white cast on the skin so i did
look this up on neutrogena's website
it does say it's an oil-free sunscreen
lotion for sensitive skin goes on evenly
absorbs quickly and feels ultra light
um it does feel pretty light like i
don't know feel a noticeable difference
on my skin
it does still feel just a slight bit
tacky
but i'm not seeing it transfer to my
fingers really when i
touch my face and then look at my
fingers so
it might dry down a little bit more too
but that's about where it's at right now
this is not
marketed as a facial sunscreen on their
website
um but it doesn't say like apply to the
body
or versus the face either so do without
what you will
it does say water resistant for 80
minutes
paba free i'm not sure what that is if
that's parabens of some type maybe
hypoallergenic which i don't know what
that means in a sunscreen
oil free fragrance free free of dyes
oils and irritating chemical ingredients
but i mean what are irritating chemical
ingredients because
like there's plenty of things i mean
everything is a chemical i guess maybe
they mean
it doesn't have chemical sunscreen
ingredients not really sure
um what exactly they mean by about that
and um they are selling it for 11.50 for
three ounces
via the neutrogena website
honestly i do think that this is um
better i've been trying out the cetaphil
sunscreens they're
mineral sunscreens that i think are
maybe newer
to them and this one is not bad so far
i'll definitely keep testing it and put
maybe a pinned comment
with um how it is with more extended use
or maybe there will just be a
more in this video after i finish
talking right now
of me coming back and checking in on
another day but i feel like i could see
this working for people if you don't
mind having some of that white cast
and like covering it up with makeup or
maybe a tinted sunscreen
which definitely is an option
i do think the white cast on this is not
the worst one
that i've had and it doesn't feel drying
um
or like irritating in any way it doesn't
feel too heavy anything like that
so i feel like this could potentially
work for people
um if you want to put in the work for a
mineral sunscreen
it doesn't specifically say that it's
non-nano zinc but i don't think there's
any requirement
to say either way so
i'm not sure on that what i do like
about it is that it isn't
a very matte finish i wouldn't say it's
super dewy or hydrating either it's just
kind of
natural maybe leaning a little bit more
hydrating but
it just overall feels fine on my skin it
doesn't feel bad in any way
um so i'll definitely keep testing this
and let you know what i think
um after some more time but so far
it's not the worst
not the best so thank you so much for
watching i'm going to be doing more of
these drugstore sunscreen videos so
if you have any sunscreens you'd like to
see applied or hear more about
any pros and cons definitely let me know
in the comments or you can check out my
other videos that i've already done
reviewing skincare products like
sunscreens
if that's interesting to you i do also
do empties videos where i'll tend to get
reviews of a lot of products that i've
actually used up completely
or if i have used up a product partially
and i just can't get it to work for me
and i'm getting rid of it
um so if you like to see reviews of
things like that
you can go ahead and check those videos
out as well and i hope to see you
in my next video bye so i have tried the
sunscreen a little bit more
and i'll go ahead and apply some on my
hand and talk about
a little bit more information so when i
first
apply this sunscreen it can feel a
little bit heavy um
on the skin almost like it's suffocating
my skin a little
i get a little bit hot um just from the
feeling on my face like it doesn't feel
hot
uh just when i apply it it does feel
heavy but
after a little bit of time you know 15
20 minutes it feels pretty normal i
don't really notice it on my skin
the sunscreen throughout the day when
i'm wearing it
doesn't feel super heavy or anything it
just feels
um neutral and it does kind of have a
neutral finish as well
it looks a little bit shiny here but
that pretty much dissipates and it has a
neutral finish as i wear it during the
day
it does however have that white cast um
i find that if i don't do a good job
blending it in
it will be a little bit streaky so you
do want to make sure that you're
you know checking how well you applied
it and everything like that
um so you don't get a white cast that's
as bad
i think it looks much better if your
white cast is um smooth versus streaky
but overall you know this applies over
itself fine i don't have any pilling
issues
um it's you know not the worst
high spf mineral sunscreen that i've
tried um
just because it does have that neutral
finish and the white cast isn't
extremely pronounced um and
it feels fairly neutral on the skin
not too heavy um not too
dewy or greasy or matte everything is
just
pretty neutral with it so overall i
think this is fine i will say it's not
very sweat resistant
i don't know if that's different from
water resistance but if i sweat it will
uh become more white and run with the
sweat
to an extent on my skin uh but overall i
didn't have any issues
with using this and i'll
continue doing so and update you if
there are any changes
i plan to do a roundup video of
drugstore sunscreens at some point so
i'll talk further about it then
hi guys i'm anisha and welcome back to
my channel
today in this video i'm going to review
two very popular neutrogena sunscreens
which you can find literally everywhere
so one of these is a physical or a
mineral based sunscreen the other one is
a chemical sunscreen
we start off by knowing what exactly is
the difference between physical
sunscreen and a chemical sunscreen
and then we'll move on to my opinion
about these and what i would recommend
depending upon your skin type and other
skin issues
so let's get started so talking about
physical sunscreens they use
mineral chemical filters which are zinc
oxide or titanium dioxide or sometimes
both so how this works is it creates a
physical barrier upon the skin
and it reflects the uv rays so it
creates like a shield on the surface of
the skin
and whereas chemical sunscreens it use
chemical uv filters
most common are octane oxide oxybenzone
and
arrow benzone etc so what it does it it
absorbs the uv rays and converts it into
heat which is then released by our skin
physical sunscreens are generally
thicker they are hard to blend
and they will give you a white cast on
your face
also these are recommended to people
with sensitive skin or rosacea prone
skin etc
whereas chemical sunscreen will be
generally lighter
it will be easier to blend won't give
you a white cast which is a great point
and is recommended to people
with oily skin and usually deeper skin
tones so that it won't
give a white cast so more or less these
were the basic differences between a
physical and a chemical sunscreen
now let's move on and look at the
products the first one i have is this
the neutrogena shear zinc dry touch
sunscreen with spf 50 plus and pa
plus it is an 80 ml bottle which retails
for 850 rupees and this one
is targeted to people with sensitive
skin
so this one is a physical sunscreen or a
mineral based sunscreen and the mineral
used is zinc oxide
now zinc oxide is a really great
ingredient as it gives protection
against all forms of uva and uvb
rays and other environmental damages so
you will get a broad spectrum protection
also the other good thing about this one
is that it is fragrance free
and hypoallergenic so it will be great
for people with sensitive skin or
actually
any skin type for that matter the
downside though is that
that it is a little bit thick it's not
greasy but you'll have to take your time
to work it in your skin
the other thing is that it will give you
a good amount of white cast
though it is true for all zinc based
sunscreens you'll have to make it a
point
because we have indian skin tones and we
don't want to look like ghosts
the trick is to take a little bit and
apply it work it in your skin then take
another bit and work it in your skin
like you're layering your sunscreen
the other thing that you can do is if
you do wear makeup you can add a little
bit of
darker colored foundation or cc cream
with it so that it becomes a tinted
sunscreen if that makes sense and it
won't
give you a white cast that bad the other
one is the neutrogena ultra shear dry
touch sunblock
with spf 50 plus pa triple plus now this
one is 88
ml and it retails for 550 rupees
this one it says that it has helioplex
technology
which represents a breadth of stabilized
sunscreens engineered to deliver broad
spectrum protection
now keep in mind that this is a chemical
sunscreen
and chemical uv filters often provide
protection against either uva
or uvb rays they are also very weak and
photo unstable
so what would brands do is they would
mix in three or more of these different
chemical uv filters
engineer it to be stable and work
properly together
so that the product gives a broad
spectrum protection
i leave the names of the uv filters used
in this one on the screen somewhere
as it is a chemical sunscreen it will be
lighter on the skin
it will be easier to blend and it won't
give you a white cast
which is great but the problem arises
with the chemical uv filters
there are a few concerns well with
oxybenzone in particular so let's see
what these are
number one is that our skin absorbs
these ingredients
the traces of these chemical uv filters
have been found in human breast milk
urine
and blood now it is said that this can
be
potentially disrupt the hormones of our
body
but it is not clinically significant as
to what extent
but due to these concerns it is
advisable for women that are pregnant
or who are breastfeeding to avoid the
use of physical sunscreens
number two oxybenzone is allergenic and
can cause skin reactions such as redness
and itchiness
if you do already have a sensitive skin
it is advisable to
not use a chemical sunscreen and move to
a physical sunscreen instead
and number three it is believed that
oxybenzone and other chemical uv filters
can potentially harm the ocean
by damaging the coral reef now some
places like hawaii have even
banned the sales of sunscreens that use
that are formulated with these chemical
uv filters
now there is no such pan in india but it
is advisable for people that are surfers
diverse swimmers or just people visiting
the beaches to use a physical
or mineral based sunscreen instead so
apart from the debatable
chemical uv filters this as most of the
other neutrogena products
also contains undisclosed fragrance now
fragrance can give you a sensorial
experience
but it's not good for your skin and
especially in a formula like
sunscreen which you do have to reapply
every two to three hours
and in a good amount it's not good for
your skin
okay so once more let's do a quick
comparison between the two
this is a physical sunscreen this one is
a chemical sunscreen this has zinc oxide
this has other chemical uv filters
this one is cheaper it won't give you a
white cast
this will give you a white cast it is a
little bit
thick and this one
has no fragrance this one has fragrance
so final thoughts i have purchased both
of them and i use both of them
but if i do have to recommend you one i
would suggest you go for the sheer zinc
one
i know it will give you a white cast and
deeper the complexion
severe the white cast but again this is
safer
the formulation is better it is a little
bit thick but it's not greasy and it
will work on all skin types
i'm going to leave it on that and well
you can
make your own decision yourself you can
pick the one that better suits you

thank you and bye
hey guys so today i'm talking all about
neutrogena sunscreen
there are 52 neutrogena sunscreen
options to choose from right now
yes 52. that is super overwhelming why
exactly are there so many options
i went through every single one of the
52 options and reviewed the ingredients
i've personally tested a large majority
of these over the years
and then again recently in my research
for this topic and now i'm here to
decode all of the neutrogena sunscreen
options in this video
let me tell you of these 52 sunscreen
options there are really only a small
number that i actually recommend
and personally use and the rest i do
not recommend and i will tell you all
about it so watch this video all the way
through and you will easily understand
how to sort through these options and
ultimately
land on a product that's right for you
in your family now many of the things
that i will talk about and teach you
about
in this video today can relate to other
sunscreen brands as well
so what you learn here today will also
be able to help you pick out
the best sunscreens from other competing
brands but why should you listen to me
on this topic i'm a board certified
dermatologist and this is my lane
i have been researching sunscreens and i
talk about them to my patients every
single
day i believe sunscreen is an important
part of our daily skin care routine
so we need to find one that we like and
that we trust
and we'll use consistently if this is
your first time on my channel

and if you want even more content from
me follow me along on some of my other
social media accounts that i always link
below so come say hi
so neutrogena is one of the most
well-known and long-standing brands in
the skincare industry
specifically for sunscreen products i
love this brand
because it's affordable and widely
available
i believe that quality skincare products
especially sunscreens
should be accessible for all with that
said neutrogena has
way too many sunscreen options when
looking at their website right now
you will see 52 unique sunscreen options
to choose from so how will the average
consumer who hops on their website or
stops by the drugstore to grab some
sunscreen on the way to the beach
know which one to choose which one is
good for the face
which one is good for the body which one
should you use on your baby or child
and which one should you wear with
makeup and which one should you wear to
the beach or swimming or does it even
matter is it all just marketing on the
packaging
as a practicing dermatologist i get
asked these questions
all the time and patients ask me for my
personal recommendations
of brands as well as specific products
within those brands
so i really spend a lot of time on this
topic and
after reviewing all 52 sunscreens on the
neutrogena website
here is my breakdown of the hits and the
misses for you
but first the basics neutrogena offers
sunscreen
in three main categories you have
lotions
sprays and sunscreen sticks you will
have the most
options to choose from in lotions then
sprays
and the least amount of options in
sticks so this choice really comes down
to user preference
as a general rule myself and most
dermatologists recommend lotions
as these tend to be more effective
sticks can also be effective if applied
in an appropriate quantity and sprays
are generally the least effective as
coverage tends to be much less than
recommended so
deciding on this category is one of the
first steps in selecting your sunscreen
the other big choice that you have to
make is choosing between a chemical
versus a mineral sunscreen now i'm not
going to get
too in-depth about the formulation of
sunscreens in this video but instead
i'll just tell you a few key points
about chemical versus mineral sunscreens
just enough info so that you can choose
which one you prefer and ultimately
you will understand my final
recommendations okay so chemical
sunscreens
use chemicals to protect your skin from
the sun
they work by absorbing the uv radiation
in the harmful spectrum
and they convert it to low energy heat
which dissipates and prevents sun damage
compare this to mineral sunscreens
which use minerals to protect you from
the sun now the mineral sunscreens sit
on top of the skin and reflect the
sunlight
off rather than absorbing it you can
tell which type of sunscreen it is
by flipping it over and looking at the
back on the ingredients label
under active ingredients you will see
either chemicals
or minerals or a combination of both
listed here
so there are six chemicals commonly used
in sunscreens in the united states
examples of these include oxybenzone and
avobinzone which are really commonly
used
in our sunscreens and there are two
mineral blockers that are available in
the us
in sunscreens and these are zinc oxide
and titanium dioxide so both chemicals
and minerals are very effective
at broad spectrum coverage meaning they
protect against uva
and uvb rays so what do i recommend
chemical or mineral
here's the deal chemical sunscreens have
the most
controversy surrounding them for four
main
reasons that is alarming to the public
first
there is evidence from a study published
in jama which is a major medical journal
that chemicals in sunscreens
specifically oxybenzone
is absorbed into the blood in high
quantities when applied to the skin
for sun protection so this finding was
very alarming for the public and it
stirred up a lot of controversy
the problem with this isolated finding
is that we don't know
the true significance of this finding
yes
it is found in the blood but does its
brief presence there
cause any harmful long-term effects we
need more research to really understand
the full picture here
but nonetheless these findings have
really reinvigorated a war
on sunscreen especially chemical
sunscreens
second the oxybenzone chemical that is
found in so many sunscreens
is thought by some to be an endocrine
disruptor which means it affects the
hormones in our bodies this claim came
about from studies
done in lab settings we need further
studies to fully understand
and to clarify its association with
hormone disruption in children and
adults
but until then it remains approved for
use in
many products but this unsubstantiated
effect in human subjects with
topical use is enough to make some
people wary
about its use so rather than wait for
confirmatory studies
people are rejecting its use altogether
now as a better safe than sorry approach
and that's totally fine i get that third
chemicals
and sunscreens have been known to cause
allergic reactions
so many people find that they break out
into a rash when they use a sunscreen
there are many ingredients that are
commonly found in sunscreens that may be
the culprit for the rash
but the chemical sunblockers are on the
top of the list for the most frequent
offenders for that reason
many people will avoid chemical
sunscreens and instead
opt for mineral ones which have
less chance of causing rashes on the
skin and fourth
there is some controversy about
oxybenzone destroying coral reefs so you
will see
a new marketing push of reef safe
sunscreens
that are formulated without this
chemical so for all of those reasons
chemical sunscreens are controversial
and leads many people
to refuse them all together and opt for
only physical or
mineral sunscreens so mineral sunblocks
like i mentioned sit on top of the skin
they have only inorganic non-absorptive
blockers
in them that aren't likely to be
absorbed in the bloodstream in the same
way the chemicals are
and these minerals are far less likely
to cause rashes on the skin
so far it seems like mineral sunscreens
are slam dunk why do chemical sunscreens
even exist
it's because of the cosmetic appeal of
the chemical sunscreens
so these chemical sunscreens are way
more user-friendly as i like to say so
they rub
in more easily they can also be removed
in the shower more easily they can blend
into the skin more easily be worn under
makeup and in
general are great at blocking the sun
now mineral blockers
are notorious for leaving that white
cast
look on the skin they are harder to rub
in and to remove
and they can be tough to wear under
makeup for some people so
newer technology has helped improve this
and also
some brands will add a tent or color to
their sunscreen to help decrease this
white cast
to some extent so it really just comes
down to a pro versus con situation
in choosing the sunscreen that's right
for you and it's a personal decision
so what do i use i stick to mineral
sunscreens as much as possible
and i recommend mineral sunscreens
exclusively
for babies and children as well as
pregnant and nursing mothers
as these chemicals have been found in
mother's bre"
