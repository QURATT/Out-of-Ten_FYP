I’ve been looking for affordable tinted sunscreen and I found this baby! this product it’s incredible. I love using this, it’s like bb cream. I highly recommend this if your working wholeday and wearing a mask. It gives you glow and at the same time protection. LOVE THIS TINTED SUNSCREEN SO MUCH.
Great ingredients! SO important to use quality products without all the junk. You will get that with this sunscreen.
Great for sensitive skin. Provide great coverage and stays put and doesn’t get into your eyes. It's an nice sunscreen!!
I am a huge fan of Cerave Skincare! It has truly worked wonders on my skin! Using most of the line from serums to wash to moisturizer to sunscreen has improved the texture and look of my skin so much the past few months! Highly reccomend Cerave products to all!
I love the sunscreen I use it mostly for the summer because that’s what it’s used for and when you go to the beach￼
This is another product i love especially when i’m out of the house and under the sun. Very easy to use. Of course it works because it’s CeraVe!
I recommend this sunscreen because it is more gentle than chemical sunscreen..also this is my opinion but I recommend this!!
I love you stick of sunscreen so much it is so easy to put on and it’s great for keeping the sun burns away it’s so easy to apply and just feels really great smells so good and I would definitely recommend it’s great for toddlers who don’t really like putting on sunscreen because they can do it on their own because it’s on a stick love it so much￼
I Love Everything About It . This Sunscreen Doesn’t Leave That White Film On Your Face . It Moisturizes Into The Skin Very Well !
It provides excellent coverage and stays on, not getting into your eyes and doesn't run because it's a stick. It's also great for sensitive skin. It's the perfect sunscreen.
Works great you don’t even need to put on makeup. It’s soft and keeps my skin clean and fresh. It also works great to keeping your skin healthy and not break out!
This goes on well and doesn’t feel too sticky. You can barely tell it’s on. I wear it underneath my makeup
Strong and long lasting. I used this for my kids at the beach and even in the water I don’t find myself having to reapply as much as others. It’s very effective and the only one I use for my family
I like this product Goes on nice you don’t hav to keep rubbing it in it’s very effective I would not improve this product at all it’s gentle enough for the family
I gave it a 4 because it sometimes leaves my face with a white tint. Other than that, it’s a great sunscreen and my face feels protected! I mix it with the moisturizing cream from Cerave and it does the job.
I really like this product because it does not leave my face white like others and it can be defined easily and it does not leave my skin dry, I highly recommend it for the summer.
Very convenient for travel use as it doesn’t take up much space in bags! Last through the hot sun and are very hydrating and protectant! I thought it was a perfect lightweight sunscreen and would definitely use again!
Easy application! Fits right into your purse so it makes it convent to bring anywhere you go!
I do like this sunscreen. I use it as a primer under my makeup or just alone on my t zone. It’s basic but good for the price. I’ll continue to repurchase plus it’s spf 50! I also like that’s it mineral I don’t break out as much.
Terrible white cast and it’s super heavy! Find the 30 SPF if possible! If you are a person of color like me the white cast is BAD!
This brand is always really great with sensitive skin. I really love the lightweight quality of the stick-- very easy for travel and application. I think it's a good value. It doesn't have a scent so I don't smell like the poolwhen I'm going to work. Highly recommended.
This stuff is pretty good, I use the version that's in a lotion form. It does the trick, but always makes my face feel oily for some reason. Maybe it's not good for my skin type! I have normal skin but it's prone to get oily in certain situations.
I am a fan of this brand. I use a lot of their products like their sunscreen and face cleanser and eye cream. This sunscreen not only is good for your skin because of the minerals it has inside but it will protect you from the sun all day long￼
Don’t get me wrong, I love Cerave products. I had heard great things about this sunscreen and I decided to purchase it but I noticed I guess it’s a new version. I did not like it. It’s just not of my liking
I’ve been using this for about a month which has been going great. It was recommended by my dermatologist

I Love Everything About It . This Sunscreen Doesn’t Leave That White Film On Your Face . It Moisturizes Into The Skin Very Well !
It provides excellent coverage and stays on, not getting into your eyes and doesn't run because it's a stick. It's also great for sensitive skin. It's the perfect sunscreen.
Works great you don’t even need to put on makeup. It’s soft and keeps my skin clean and fresh. It also works great to keeping your skin healthy and not break out!
This goes on well and doesn’t feel too sticky. You can barely tell it’s on. I wear it underneath my makeup
Strong and long lasting. I used this for my kids at the beach and even in the water I don’t find myself having to reapply as much as others. It’s very effective and the only one I use for my family
I like this product Goes on nice you don’t hav to keep rubbing it in it’s very effective I would not improve this product at all it’s gentle enough for the family
I gave it a 4 because it sometimes leaves my face with a white tint. Other than that, it’s a great sunscreen and my face feels protected! I mix it with the moisturizing cream from Cerave and it does the job.
I really like this product because it does not leave my face white like others and it can be defined easily and it does not leave my skin dry, I highly recommend it for the summer.
Very convenient for travel use as it doesn’t take up much space in bags! Last through the hot sun and are very hydrating and protectant! I thought it was a perfect lightweight sunscreen and would definitely use again!
Easy application! Fits right into your purse so it makes it convent to bring anywhere you go!
I do like this sunscreen. I use it as a primer under my makeup or just alone on my t zone. It’s basic but good for the price. I’ll continue to repurchase plus it’s spf 50! I also like that’s it mineral I don’t break out as much.
Terrible white cast and it’s super heavy! Find the 30 SPF if possible! If you are a person of color like me the white cast is BAD!
This brand is always really great with sensitive skin. I really love the lightweight quality of the stick-- very easy for travel and application. I think it's a good value. It doesn't have a scent so I don't smell like the poolwhen I'm going to work. Highly recommended.
This stuff is pretty good, I use the version that's in a lotion form. It does the trick, but always makes my face feel oily for some reason. Maybe it's not good for my skin type! I have normal skin but it's prone to get oily in certain situations.
I am a fan of this brand. I use a lot of their products like their sunscreen and face cleanser and eye cream. This sunscreen not only is good for your skin because of the minerals it has inside but it will protect you from the sun all day long￼
Don’t get me wrong, I love Cerave products. I had heard great things about this sunscreen and I decided to purchase it but I noticed I guess it’s a new version. I did not like it. It’s just not of my liking
I’ve been using this for about a month which has been going great. It was recommended by my dermatologist

I’ve been looking for affordable tinted sunscreen and I found this baby! this product it’s incredible. I love using this, it’s like bb cream. I highly recommend this if your working wholeday and wearing a mask. It gives you glow and at the same time protection. LOVE THIS TINTED SUNSCREEN SO MUCH.
Great ingredients! SO important to use quality products without all the junk. You will get that with this sunscreen.
Great for sensitive skin. Provide great coverage and stays put and doesn’t get into your eyes. It's an nice sunscreen!!
I am a huge fan of Cerave Skincare! It has truly worked wonders on my skin! Using most of the line from serums to wash to moisturizer to sunscreen has improved the texture and look of my skin so much the past few months! Highly reccomend Cerave products to all!
I love the sunscreen I use it mostly for the summer because that’s what it’s used for and when you go to the beach￼
This is another product i love especially when i’m out of the house and under the sun. Very easy to use. Of course it works because it’s CeraVe!
