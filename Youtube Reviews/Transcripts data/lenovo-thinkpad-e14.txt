"What's going on, guys? It is Bernardo and you  just saw a quick unboxing on Lenovo's ThinkPad E14"
"Generation 2 laptop. So what comes inside the  box? We have our safety and warranty guide"
"we have the thinkpad e 14 gen 2 setup guide. Cool."
"We have our 65 watt power supply with a type  C connection and we have our power cable."
"Now I'm going to take the power cable and  the power adapter and I'm going to hook it up"
"awesome. Cool. We'll going to  put this stuff to the side."
"And then last but not least, we have the beautiful  ThinkPad E 14 generation two laptop weighing"
"around 3.4 with a thickness of 0.72 inches. Now  using this laptop and reviewing it for you guys"
"I had a lot of fun super powerful with the  Windows 11 operating system installed on it."
"All right so before we open this guy up and  power it on let's look at some of the ports"
"and features now if you had a laptop to the  point that you're able to open it up like this"
"on your right hand side we have  the following ports we have"
"one 2.0 USB port and then we have  our RJ 45 port or Ethernet port."
"On the left hand side we have our  combo audio Jack, a HDMI port a 3.2"
"USB always on charging and our Type C  port, which also allows us to hook up"
"our power cable. All right. So we just  went over some of the ports of features"
"on the ThinkPad E 14 generation two laptop.  So let's open this guy up real quick"
"oh look at that beautiful 14 inch display and  we will talk about the display pretty soon."
"So don't worry about that. Let's talk about  the power button which is located right here."
"And the power button is actually integrated with  the fingerprint scanner. So it's a one shot deal."
"So let's turn it on. Like I said before,  the fingerprint scanner is integrated with"
"the power button, so you don't really need to do  anything, just power it on and you're good to go."
"But if you guys want to see it in action, so  let's lock it real quick it's already locked."
"It's locked and we use the  fingerprint scanner and scan in,"
"Boom. All right. So let's talk about the  trackpad on the E 14 now the trackpad"
"measurement is around 3.98 inches using it. I  didn't have any issues at all. I did find myself"
"plugging in a USB mouse half the time you do  have the option to use a track point on the E 14."
"So that's an option there. And you could  take advantage of the left and right click"
"options at the top or the keyboard on the  E 14. Again, it is a ThinkPad keyboard. I"
"usually don't have any issues with these  keyboards. It's super responsive I love the"
"way it feels on my fingertips. So again,  I didn't have any issues on the keyboard."
"Now the keyboard is back lit. That works well  if you're working at night. The measurements"
"between each key is around 0.13 inches now  for speakers on the E 14 actually located on"
"the left and right hand side at the bottom of  the laptop. If the laptop is on a hard surface,"
"you get a pretty loud sound because the sound  is actually bouncing off the hard surface."
"The loudness that I got on the speakers was  around 92.3 decibels. Now for the display"
"like I said before, it is 14 inches Full HD  with a resolution of 1920 by 1080. It is anti"
"glare for the brightness level right now I  think this is the highest on the brightness"
"and this is the lowest and again this is the  highest and this is the lowest that it could go."
"And again this is the highest if you want to  know about nits, I think between 220 and 300,"
"it all depends on the model that you get at  the Lenovo site. The E 14 does have HDR enabled"
"within Windows ten but only for streaming content  online. Now the refresh rate for this particular"
"model is around 60.05 Hertz. Now the scaling  of the display by default comes around 150%."
"I found like the icons in the fonts were too  big for me, so I had to reduce it around 125%."
"125% for me was great. It's nice size and  the icons are not huge like popping out"
"right in front of me at the top of the display  you do have a 720 webcam with a privacy guard"
"right next to the webcam you  have your dual mic system."
"All right. So the performance on the E 14 was  awesome. It was on point with the specifications"
"that Lenovo sent me. So if I'm going to actually  do a command, I typically do right click on the"
"taskbar. So I'm going to hold the control shift  and then escape, and that's going to bring up"
"the task manager. Let's do more details  and let's open this guy up real quick."
"Let's do performance. I'm going to right click  on the CPU change graph to a logical processor."
"Awesome. So this machine is actually  running 11th gen Intel Core i5 1135"
"G seven CPU what clock speed of 2.40 gigahertz as  one socket four cores eight logical processors."
"It's a good machine now for memory.  It only has around eight gigs."
"It does come with a solid state  drive which is around 256 gigs."
"And for the graphics card it comes with  the Intel Iris XE Graphics. Now what the"
"specification is on the E 14 I was able to  do so much I was able to do my editing within"
"premiere. I was able to edit audio within  audition as well as render 4K within media encoder"
"and editing 4K files was really simple because  I didn't need to create any proxy files."
"I was also able to do a little bit  of coloring within to Vinci Resolve,"
"which was a huge plus. Now this guy does get  hot around this area right here and around here."
"When I use my heat gun, I got a temperature  of around 94 degrees. So you got to make sure,"
"you know, if you put it on  your lap, it will get warm."
"Now, this guy does have vents. He has vents at  the bottom of the laptop as well as in between the"
"display right here. Now for gaming on the ThinkPad  e 14. I was able to play jump force without any"
"lag, which I was super impressed because of the  graphics card. It's only running an Intel Iris"
"XE graphics card, but I was actually able to  do some combos on this machine without any lag."
"All right. So let's look at the battery life  on the ThinkPad E 14 gen two from Lenovo."
"So I'm going to close out the task manager  and for every laptop I like to use PC mark ten"
"and run three performance tests. Now the first  one is all about the modern office battery life."
"And what it basically does is uses Excel word  PowerPoint goes on line, edit some photos"
"until the battery reaches around 2% and then dies."
"The battery life on this test took around 7  hours and 20 minutes on my second test, I ran"
"video battery life and it took around 9 hours and  45 minutes. And my last test was all about gaming"
"and it took around 2 hours and 41 minutes average  without using PC mark ten. I was using the machine"
"with my editing with premiere doing some  color correction with De Vinci, resolve"
"play some games going online  editing some Photoshop files."
"I was able to get between six and a half  to 7 hours of battery life on this machine,"
"but it all depends on how you use  it. All right, so let's conclude"
"our unboxing slash review on the Lenovo's  ThinkPad E 14 generation two laptop."
"So the laptop, I didn't have a chance to hook up  an external monitor, but you do have that HDMI"
"port to just hook up an external monitor and  you're good to go now for starting price on the"
"E 14 generation two, you can get it under $700,  but it all depends on how you get it configured."
"At the Lenovo site, it goes up  to $1,000. I think that's like"
"close to the highest price point on this machine.  But again, like I said, it all depends on how you"
"get it configured. Now overall, our experience on  this machine, I had a lot of fun, especially with"
"Windows 11. I believe Windows 11 kind of enhances  all the features on this particular laptop,"
"which was a plus using it with premiere, Audition,  Photoshop, Da Vinci Resolve using Camtasia,"
"going online, watching video, watching  movies and stuff, listening to music."
"It was perfect. It's a great overall  starting laptop if you need to travel"
"and do your day to day stuff on it. Now, one of  the cool things about this laptop is it's not"
"touch screen, which again, like I said, throughout  all my videos, I don't like touchscreen laptops"
"which the E 14 isn't, which is great. One thing  it does lack for me is it lacks an SD card slot."
"I would definitely love to see on this machine a  SD card slot because, you know, I could take my SD"
"card slots out of my cameras plug it in, you know,  hook it up to this laptop and start dragging and"
"drop in the photos and my videos on to the machine  so I could start editing. I actually got it to get"
"an SD card reader dongle, plug it in and then  that's the way I could retrieve my information."
"But that's the only thing that  this machine kind of lacks"
"because it does come with an Ethernet  port. I could hard wire in to get fast"
"Internet speeds, which is a plus, and that's it.  Hopefully you enjoyed this unboxing slash review"
"on Lenovo's ThinkPad E 14 generation two laptop  and I catch you guys on the next one peace out."
"get everyone be asian dad here how you"
"guys doing hope you guys are doing very"
"well and feeling healthy and safe over"

"a business class laptop which is great"
"so which means they can take a bit of"
"beating and this is the e class now the"
"e class is the entry model to the"
"thinkpad range now i'm not new to the"
"thinkpad range i've actually played with"
"the t-series x series as well as p"
"series but i've never played with an"
"e-series so this is new to me completely"
"now this one i've got here specifically"
"is the ryzen 5 version now i've actually"
"tested ryzen 5 in another laptop and"
"that chip has blown me away i was amazed"

"the power section"
"all right here i can see this is your"
"typical 65 watt power adapter and it is"
"going to charge it through the usbc so"
"that's kind of good to see and that's"
"the bow we'll just chuck that on that"

"going to chuck the box down here"
"all right okay now let's get on to"
"what's on this thing here"
"let's bring this up oh there we go oh i"
"can definitely see straight away some"
"differences here oh let's chuck that"
"away here oh this is"
"a very smooth feel to"
"the thinkpads i am loving this sort of"
"texture to it very different to"
"the"
"t series and x series as well the p"
"series then kind of more of a matte sort"
"of feel to them this is not a matter"
"this is a more smoother feel to it like"
"it is still it's still got that you know"
"plastic small looks like plastic it is"
"um uh pva or something but my god i love"
"to feel these here this has a very good"
"feel to it uh for sure so anyway let's"
"quickly look at what ports there is"
"before i open this thing up okay looking"
"on the right i'm sorry left hand side of"
"the computer we've got uh one usb c port"
"so i'm taking this is a 3.2 gen 2 port"
"it's not going to be thunderbolt because"
"this one here is an amd and they don't"
"have thunderbolt because that's"
"exclusive to intel computers then we've"
"got a normal type a port for usb so"
"that's probably usb 3.1 gen1 port and"
"then we've got hmi port more than likely"
"that will be version 1.4 b and then"
"we'll get the headphone jack combo jack"
"which is great uh nothing along the"
"front and nothing along the back"
"and then on the right hand side we've"
"got the security lock slot and then"
"we've got the ethernet port"
"ethernet port fantastic on a little bit"
"of the lever system there that's good to"
"see that's still got the ethernet port a"
"lot of the other think pads from the t"
"series they've lost the ethernet port so"
"good to see that e series has got sorry"
"t series before is what i mentioned and"
"so it's good to see t and p and x all"
"right i've lost the ethernet port so"
"you've got to buy a dongle for that but"
"this has got it i liking that and then"
"we've got another usb 3.1 gen1 port"
"which is type a port which is great to"
"see and that's about all there is so"
"there's no micro sd card reader for this"
"but that's not that bad for it really so"
"i am excited i love the feel of this"
"this has got a very nice smooth"
"and that's for fingerprints it does grab"
"a little but not crazy amount like"
"compared to the t series and i'm going"
"to get one of my helpers out here"
"so we can actually just make this bring"
"this up so i'll pop it up so you can see"
"there's a little bit better anyway so"
"anyway let's gonna open this up together"
"now one finger test it does open up one"
"finger because it's great oh it does"
"pretty well with one finger"
"oh yeah it goes all the way one finger"
"that's not bad here"
"not bad at all now this one is a"
"clamshell one so it won't go past the"
"180 degrees oh i'm impressed by that"
"okay we don't need keyboard cover oh"
"this is nice i am loving the"
"oh the keys on this is really nice it's"
"got the"
"carbon so x series keyboard in there so"
"it's got that smooth texture for each"
"individual key and of course being a"
"pink pad it's got the big pad keyboard i"
"love it because it's got plenty of"
"tactile feel to it good key travel good"
"spacing in between as well and now of"
"course they've got that famous track"
"point oh the g sports what they call it"
"just because where it's located and then"
"you've got your supporting free buttons"
"on below the"
"space bar and i can actually see the"
"space bar here it's also got the"
"backlight so it's function spacebar will"
"get your backlight and of course usually"
"it's about three settings for that off"
"middle and high for the backlight as"
"well and then your typical thinkpad"
"trackpad here which is of course"
"mechanical on the bottom so it's hinged"
"on the top and it's mechanical the bomb"
"so you can just do that and as for the"
"texture wise it's got a bit of a smooth"
"matte feel to that too as well which is"
"great and i can see there's actually a"
"fingerprint reader"
"located where the power button is well"
"too and that's located on the side here"
"whoa that's very different there as well"
"too so that's nice to see that they've"
"got that engraved they don't have that"
"in their t-series"
"that's located separately with"
"fingerprints so i like the e series at"
"the moment it is a ryzen 5 version here"
"as well i can see from the sticker here"
"as well so that you should be i think"
"there are six cores as well too which is"
"great so definitely good win there now"
"let's gonna try and file this computer"
"up here"
"uh i can also see the new keys for 2020"
"is the"
"from f9 to f11 they're the real"
"conferencing keys and that's new to 2020"
"as well and an f12 is the customization"
"button where you can customize to"
"anything you want uh you do that in the"
"software anyway anyway let's try and"
"build this thing up"
"and i can see straight away also you i"
"can see the vents are located behind the"
"hinge there are two types of vents i can"
"see probe ones is exhaust and one is"
"actually"
"i think it's a"
"brief hole as well too because it's got"
"different type of grille on there all"
"right but let's have a look is it"
"turning on i've never had very good luck"
"in turning these things on on camera but"
"i will have it really ready to go"
"because i know you're more than likely"
"you need to plug this in power so here i"
"go i'll grab one here"
"all right okay i've got a power cable"
"here"
"here we go all right let's plug that in"
"and hopefully we've got that thing"
"charged and we'll just turn this baby on"
"oh so the power button already has a"
"nice sort of glow to the power button"
"it's white that goes around the"
"fingerprint reader and i can definitely"
"see"
"there's not much of the bezel on the"
"side for sure that is good and along the"
"bottom even then the bottom it doesn't"
"have that much better i'm thinking this"
"is really nice compared to even to the t"
"series as well so and as the top while"
"it's got a little bit of bezel but not"
"crazy i would call this"
"probably"
"slim"
"medium it's probably what i would call"
"it narrow medium it's not like narrow"
"it's not medium but it's about"
"a medium narrow maybe that's the word"
"i'll turn out and of course there's a"
"720p webcam on top and i can see there's"
"a privacy shadows just made a good old"
"flick of the switch and you have a"
"physical shadow on there so that's great"
"to see they've also included that in"
"there now as for the display wise it is"
"this one doesn't have of course no touch"
"uh but it's got a very matte feel look"
"to it as well so it's not a glossy one"
"it's a matte look too"
"and that is a sixteen by nine"
"for the rec"
"ratio so i'm going to quickly go through"
"the setup and i do want to fire up the"
"speakers on this because i can see there"
"are two speakers located on the bottom"
"and i'll just have a quick sound of what"
"it sounds like and i can just give you a"
"quick feedback on the sound so i've got"
"the computer all set up and i had a bit"
"of a play with the computer very quickly"
"and especially with the audio and i've"
"got to say i'm pretty impressed by the"
"audio here i was expecting pretty"
"average sound and it did a lot better"
"than average it's actually got a lot of"
"bass and i found when i was actually"
"flipping this computer around it says"
"audio by harman so it actually has a"
"little bit of oomph here for the sound"
"and it's actually quite balanced as well"
"and it's actually got pretty good"
"acoustics i'm surprising that comes out"
"of these two small speakers they really"
"did surprise me i actually better than"
"the t series uh they're not up at the x"
"series level yet but they're better than"
"the t series and the p series as well so"
"that is very surprising for coming"
"straight from uh entry model which is"
"the e series so"
"i am very impressed with the audio here"
"now as for the display eyes it could"
"it's only about 220 nits i think this"
"one is which is full hd that's kind of"
"all you expect but i do wish it was a"
"little bit more bright at them i've got"
"some about four lights here glaring at"
"it so it's why it looks a little bit dim"
"here but when the lights aren't that"
"bright uh you'll be doing okay when"
"you're indoors and in office type work"
"but if you're coming outdoors you'll"
"probably be struts to struggle"
"especially in daylight and stuff like"
"that so uh for like coffee sort of dates"
"and stuff though or doing"
"work in a coffee shop i think you'll be"
"more better than sitting indoors and"
"sitting outdoors you'll probably start"
"to struggle a little before the"
"brightness of the display anyway so but"
"overall this computer has been pretty"
"amazing"
"blowing my expectation what the e series"
"is"
"i'm very impressed by this e-series now"
"i will with my follow-up video i will be"
"looking at its temperatures as well with"
"fan noise i'll also look at the"
"internals as well in the performance of"
"this computer now this is horizon five"
"so i expect it to be pretty decent here"
"anyway i hope you catch one of those"
"amazing black friday deals and as always"
"if ha if you find this video informative"
"and enjoyed it smack that like for me"
"just to support my channel as well and"
"if you haven't done already subscribe to"
"my channel but hit it subscribe button"
"bottom screen i do upload a new video"
"every week and just remember"
"imperfections in life makes it beautiful"
"and interesting i'll see you next video"
"laptop manufacturers rarely change the"
"visual design of their second or even"
"third generation devices"
"such is the case with thinkpad e14"
"generation ii by lenovo which looks just"
"the same as its predecessor but now"
"sports a thunderbolt 4 port and upgraded"
"internals in the same rigid chassis"
"the lid is made out of aluminum while"
"the rest of the case is plastic"
"this results in a rather light machine"
"that stops the scales at around 1.6"
"kilos and has a thickness of under 19"
"millimeters"
"also this notebook sits quite high above"
"the ground thanks to its large back foot"
"this results in more breathing space for"
"the fan typically thinkpad devices are"
"equipped with great keyboards and this"
"one is not an exclusion"
"additionally you get the legendary track"
"point a feature some people prefer over"
"the regular touchpad"
"on the left side you will find a"
"thunderbolt 4 connector usb type a 3.2"
"generation 1 port an hdmi 1.4 b"
"connector and an audio jack"
"at the right side you will find a"
"kensington lock slot an rj45 connector"
"and a usb type a 2.0 generation 1 port"
"this laptop offers one sodom slot for"
"memory upgrades this allows you to"
"expand the 8 gigabytes of soldered ram"
"with up to 32 gigabytes more"
"additionally there are two m2 storage"
"slots they fit 42 and 80 millimeters"
"drives if you want to see how to open"
"the laptop you can check out our"
"teardown video"
"only 2 per 100 people watching this"
"video are subscribers if you decide to"
"just start following us we'll be able to"
"reinvest more in our laboratory thus"
"making even more helpful videos for you"
"thank you you're awesome"
"this notebook's 1080p ips display has"
"wide viewing angles and a good contrast"
"ratio of"
"1150 to 1."
"as with most business devices in this"
"price range it covers only 50 of the"
"srgb gamut which results in a dull"
"looking image"
"thankfully the panel doesn't use pwm for"
"brightness adjustment allowing you to"
"comfortably work for long periods of"
"time"
"unfortunately the battery life here was"
"underwhelming with less than seven hours"
"of web browsing or about five hours of"
"video playback"
"it's not bad but we've seen better"
"on the other hand the hardware is pretty"
"capable with the top model featuring a"
"core"
"i71165g7 and an nvidia geforce mx450"
"we were only able to get a laptop with"
"the core i3115g4"
"however 11th generation core i3 is"
"comparable with 10th generation core i7"
"10510u"
"this is because of the efforts of both"
"intel and lenovo the thinkpad e14"
"generation 2 is equipped with a cooling"
"solution that enables the processor to"
"run at 3.6 gigahertz for more than 15"
"minutes straight"
"there is one thing that we didn't like"
"about the laptop and it is the battery"
"life"
"other than that we got a good impression"
"from the build quality and the keyboard"
"also it is a small powerhouse even if"
"you pick the most affordable option with"
"the core i3 processor"
"in addition to that the upgrade options"
"are good and the display is fine enough"
"for business purposes"
"if you'd like to find more information"
"about this machine you can see all of"
"the tests we've performed in our"
"in-depth review"
"link in the video description below"
"[Music]"
"you"
"good everyone be asian dad here we're"
"going to do the in-depth review of this"
"lenovo thinkpad e14 gen 2. now this one"
"i've got here is the amd version and it"
"is a 14 inch business class laptop now"
"being part of the thinkpad series it's"
"made to be quite durable which is great"
"and being the e series is the entry"
"model to the business class laptops but"
"then you'll find out this entry model is"
"not that entry at all i actually find it"
"really good but more on that later what"
"we'll do is we'll have a little bit of a"
"peek of the internals a little bit later"
"in the video so stick around for that"
"and we'll also look at the temperatures"
"and fan noise of this computer as well"
"as its features as well now i will be"
"putting timestamps along this video so"
"you can actually skip to the different"
"sections that you might be interested in"
"let's have a look at the ports starting"
"on the left hand side of the computer"
"we've got the usbc port which is usb 3.2"
"gen2 now this supports power delivery so"
"that's where you actually plug in the"
"power adapter and you also plug in"
"docking stations as well"
"and then we've got the usb type a port"
"that's usb 3.2 gen1 and the supports"
"power sharing as well and then we've got"
"the hmi port which is version 1.4 and"
"then we've got the headphone jack"
"looking on the right hand side we've got"
"the security lock slot and then we've"
"got the rj45 and that's on the lever"
"system here and then we've got the usb"
"type a port which is usb 3.2 gen1 port"
"what this computer can be configured"
"with now this is the amd version so we"
"just go through the amd processor so it"
"can be configured with either the ryzen"
"3 which runs off four cores or the ryzen"
"5 which this one is and that is six"
"cores and there's also the ryzen 7 as"
"well which runs off eight cores now as"
"for ram rise it can go up to a maximum"
"capacity of 24 gigs of ram so you can go"
"up to eight gigs soldered to the system"
"board and then there's a dimm slot for"
"16 gigs now my advice is for the ram is"
"to if you really do"
"do a bit of 3d graphics is to make sure"
"you've got dual channel so you get half"
"of it on the system board and the other"
"half on the dim slot and you will find"
"the actual 3d graphics is greatly"
"improved nearly double the performance"
"so definitely look into that when you"
"get this computer configured with as for"
"storage wise it's got two slots for m.2"
"so you can put two ssd hard drives in"
"there and as for the graphics it's of"
"course using integrated graphics and"
"this one is the amd radon graphics and"
"don't be surprised it is actually pretty"
"decent and as for the display wise there"
"are actually two options for displays"
"for this one here and they both are full"
"hd options and of course there are no"
"touch as well and there are two"
"different panel types now the tn panel"
"type it is graded to 220 nits of"
"brightness and then there is a wva"
"version which is rated to 250 nits of"
"brightness which is what i've got right"
"here and we'll have a little bit"
"check on the display panel a little bit"
"later in the video and you'll find"
"there's a very interesting thing about"
"the display panel especially when it's"
"on battery the computer does come with a"
"720p webcam and there are two versions"
"of it this one here is just a normal"
"720p webcam and you'll see there's a"
"privacy shutter so it's just made a"
"little flick of a switch and you'll see"
"a physical shutter go over it and pretty"
"much it will just cover the webcam so if"
"it actually turns on"
"you can't really see anything which is"
"great the other version is the ir"
"version and that's really good for if"
"you're using windows hello this is a"
"recording from the 720p webcam from the"
"e14 now this is the video and audio and"
"edited so you can actually hear and see"
"what it looks like now i've actually got"
"two types of lights currently turned on"
"i've got one of my studio lights turned"
"on and i've also got my downloads from"
"this room which is the ambient light now"
"i'm going to turn off my studio light so"
"you can see what it looks like with just"
"the ambient light"
"and pretty much i've got two down lights"
"in front of me i've got two down lights"
"behind me and the two downloads in front"
"of me is quite far away so there's"
"actually not much light hitting my basic"
"mode so this is kind of like very dark"
"now in an office environment you"
"probably get a little bit better"
"lighting than what i've got at the"
"moment so this is kind of what it looks"
"like and i'll just turn my studio light"
"back on so you can see what it looks"
"like and of course with better lighting"
"better quality picture now i'd love to"
"hear what your thoughts are about this"
"webcam"
"love to hear what it is put a comment"
"below as for the keyboard it of course"
"houses the good old strong thinkpad"
"keyboard and if you've seen my previous"
"videos you know i love this keyboard a"
"lot it has very good tactile feel and"
"good key travel as well as this finish"
"of the each keys is quite smooth so"
"that's nice and it's got good spacing in"
"between as well so it's fantastic for"
"typing as well now it is quite"
"responsive even you just press it on the"
"side so you can see it's actually very"
"responsive to that as well now of course"
"they're in the middle it's still the"
"track point or on the g spot and you've"
"got the three supporting buttons below"
"the space key and then we've got the"
"track pad here and again it is quite"
"smooth matte feel to it as well and"
"doesn't have any problems if you've got"
"moist hands as well for that and of"
"course it's hinge at the top so it's"
"only mechanical at the bottom here so"
"you can still depress it at the bottom"
"here now there is a fingerprint scanner"
"built into the power button and you can"
"see the pattern was quite nicely lit"
"with a nice little led glow so that's"
"kind of nice so it's not that crazy"
"distracting and also the keyboard is"
"backlit as well so that's just function"
"spacebar will activate the three"
"different modes off medium and high and"
"as for the build construction of this"
"computer here now the top of the display"
"the lid here is made of aluminium and as"
"for the bottom and the sides it is"
"pretty much plastic all the way through"
"but it is quite durable actually there's"
"not much flex there involved as well and"
"as for the keyboard it's actually quite"
"stiff here so definitely good good"
"construction here for sure you won't"
"have any problems with that as well and"
"it does take a bit of fingerprints"
"unfortunately for the whole entire thing"
"so it does take a bit of a fingerprints"
"but i think kyle will get used to that"
"for especially for black as well and as"
"for the palm rest you've got a nice"
"decent amount of palm rest and you're"
"not going to be overhanging on the wrist"
"too bad so i mean sorry the upper part"
"of your wrist so you actually there's"
"your type you actually find still quite"
"comfortable as well too so not really"
"overhanging there so definitely the"
"palm rest is a bit of a matte"
"sort of plastic feel to it it's actually"
"not too bad at all and you'll see in"
"temperature test it's not pad at all"
"there are two speakers located on bottom"
"front of the computer now when i"
"measured out the maximum volume of the"
"speakers it managed to measure at a peak"
"of 78.8"
"decibels so that's a bit quiet compared"
"to a lot of other business laptops so"
"you may find yourself a little bit"
"struggling when you're outdoors"
"listening to this order or if you're in"
"a cafe doing a presentation it may be a"
"little bit of a struggle there but i"
"think you'll still be able to do it fine"
"but you may find it's on a bit of a"
"quiet side of things but else it's"
"actually all right as for the sound"
"quality why is it"
"this one actually did surprise me it"
"actually is not bad at all especially as"
"a business laptop it has a bit of bass"
"the mids were there and as for the highs"
"it did unfortunately distort a little"
"bit when you had it on a maximum volume"
"but it was it was actually quite"
"balanced and had a pretty good acoustic"
"com surprising from two little small"
"speakers so not bad at all especially"
"this is an entry model this actually for"
"me was better than the t series for the"
"thinkpads so that's pretty good there"
"for the speakers the computer comes with"
"a 65 watt power adapter and is actually"
"quite small and it does actually charge"
"by the usbc cable now as for the battery"
"it houses a 45 watt hour battery and"
"it does support rapid charge and what"
"that means is it can charge from the"
"battery from zero to eighty percent"
"charge in one hour's time i did test out"
"the battery life of this ryzen 5 version"
"and i did it in the four different modes"
"now in best performance mode it managed"
"to get an hour and 40 minutes and in"
"better performance mode it managed to"
"get an hour and 50 minutes only a little"
"bit better and in better battery life"
"mode it managed to get seven hours"
"and in battery saving mode it managed to"
"get 9 hours and 15 minutes and in media"
"mode i had wi-fi on and streaming"
"youtube videos and had the screen"
"brightness at 50 as well as the speakers"
"at 50 percent and it managed to get"
"eight hours and 15 minutes as of time of"
"recording this video when i actually"
"performed the testers i did found an"
"issue and i thought i might just give"
"you a heads up on this and that is when"
"i this computer goes into hibernation"
"mode it actually won't be able to wake"
"it itself up it seems to have an issue"
"with that so you might need to actually"
"turn off the hibernation of this"
"computer and i have reported to lenovo"
"hopefully they'll actually"
"put a bias update and then we'll"
"actually have that fixed so hopefully"
"i'll come out soon but just for those"
"who are actually purchasing very soon or"
"now uh you might actually want to turn"
"off that hibernation feature which is"
"basically deep sleep um you might"
"actually find that very have issues"
"trying itself waking itself up and if"
"you do pretty much just hold down the"
"power key into about five or ten seconds"
"it will actually completely kill off and"
"then you can start it up again i just"
"want to give you a heads up on that"
"that's all the weight of the lenovo"
"thinkpad e14 gen 2 is"
"1.58 kilos add in the 65 watt power"
"adapter becomes a total weight of"
"1.95 kilos"
"when i tested out the temperatures and"
"fan noise of this computer when i put"
"this computer on load i found most of"
"the hottest area of the computer is"
"located near the center of the keyboard"
"sitting around with the y key and also"
"on the top right of the computer as well"
"around about where the home key is and"
"that's unsurprising that's where the"
"exhaust fence is now from my unboxing"
"video i saw the other vent on the left"
"hand side of the computer and that was"
"the inlet vent so it is pretty much"
"where it starts to suck in the air so"
"you'll find also in the measurement it's"
"not as hot there as well but as the"
"center of the keyboard you'll find even"
"then it's not that crazy hot so it was"
"actually quite hard to actually"
"differentiate which ones was going to be"
"the hottest area now when i performed"
"the measurements my ambient temperature"
"was 22 degrees celsius and i took my"
"base measurement when the computer is on"
"idle and the hottest area of the"
"keyboard measured in at 31 degrees"
"celsius and the fan noise was 31"
"decibels so that's pretty much quiet and"
"that's pretty much cold as well and then"
"i put the computer on 20 percent load"
"and again the hottest area of the"
"keyboard measured in a peak of 31"
"degrees celsius and the fan noise was"
"still at 31 decibels so pretty much it"
"hasn't really done very much at all so"
"it still kept itself quiet which is"
"great and then i put the computer on 50"
"load and the hottest area of the"
"keyboard measured in at 37 degrees"
"celsius and as for the fan noise and"
"measured in a maximum of 32 decibels so"
"still quite quiet but it's spun up a"
"little bit it's quite quiet still and as"
"for the temperature you don't really"
"feel that much and then i put the"
"computer on a hundred percent load and"
"the hottest area of the keyboard"
"measured in at"
"42.5 degrees celsius and the fan noise"
"measured in a maximum of 33 decibels so"
"still quite quiet surprisingly and then"
"i also measured the bottom back cover of"
"the computer and the hottest area"
"measured in at 41 degrees celsius but"
"most of the areas was around about"
"hottest areas about 40 degrees celsius"
"and of course the fan noise was 33"
"decibels so as you can see this computer"
"is not hot at all even on most of the"
"time when you're doing average juice up"
"to 50 it's not that hot neither at all"
"you can and even 100 you can quite"
"happily put your hand down you feel a"
"little warm and that's about it it's not"
"that hot at all it's not burning hot"
"this for once is a very very cool"
"computer when you're actually working on"
"even though at measuring at 41 degrees"
"celsius you can probably put this on"
"your lap but i still wouldn't advise you"
"to put this on the lap but you probably"
"couldn't wouldn't feel too"
"distressed from it it will feel a little"
"bit warm but not too distressed where it"
"actually will be burning you so that's a"
"bit of a surprise how well the"
"temperatures are on this ryzen 5 version"
"of this computer i am very impressed by"
"that let's have a look at the internals"
"first off you need to unscrew the seven"
"screws that's holding the back cover in"
"after that you need a tool to pry this"
"thing open now this is not an easy job"
"this one i'm just using my daughter's"
"play-doh sculpture tool seems to work"
"very well for this hopefully later on"
"i'll upgrade it but my advice is to"
"actually come bring from the corners and"
"then go slowly slice it down to on the"
"front and then on the corner slowly"
"slice it through the sides as well and"
"then just repeat this again from the"
"other side so slowly from the corner"
"slowly slice it from the front and"
"slowly slice it from the back and then"
"after you should be able to lift this"
"open now i've actually pre undone this"
"to speed up some time and"
"this is what the internals kind of look"
"like now"
"we can straight away see we've got the"
"45 watt hour battery and to actually"
"undo the battery it's held in by"
"five screws here and this is the little"
"tab you can pretty much"
"pull it down"
"and then you should be able to lift this"
"thing up so that's kind of what you see"
"then we've got the coin battery right"
"here but you don't need to actually undo"
"that you can pretty much undo it from"
"here if need be so i'll just put this"
"one back in here place here"
"and"
"straight away this is the first slot of"
"ssd hard drive here so m.2 and then this"
"there is the second ssd hard drive which"
"is the other m.2 that so you got two to"
"actually work off because this one's"
"only for the smaller ones and this one's"
"for the larger ones here and then we've"
"got the wi-fi card here and right"
"underneath this heat shield"
"is i'm just pry it open ready and is"
"where the sol dim slot is for the ram"
"upgrades that's pretty much all there is"
"to internals as the display panel is a"
"16 by 9 aspect ratio and as for the"
"finish of the display panel it is an"
"anti-glare"
"feel to the display panel so it's not a"
"glossy one it's one of those matte feel"
"as for the bezel wise you'll see it's"
"actually i would say medium narrow it's"
"not crazy narrow all the way through but"
"it is nice and narrow in the sides and"
"as from the top and bottom it's decently"
"narrow enough but it's not like super"
"thick neither and it's not super thin"
"like some of the other"
"computers around testing out the color"
"gamut coverage or the full hd 250 nit"
"display it measured in at"
"56.4 percent srgb coverage and 39"
"adobe rgb coverage and 40"
"dci p3 coverage"
"i found a very interesting thing while i"
"was testing out the brightness of the"
"display panel and that is when this"
"computer is on battery it will limit the"
"brightness of the display panel now at"
"the moment it's running on battery and"
"i've got it at its maximum brightness"
"and it is only going up to a maximum of"
"88 candidates per square meter which is"
"88 nits of brightness now just to show"
"you it's actually reading from that i'm"
"just going to pull this off so you can"
"see that current change and i'll just"
"put it back on so"
"it's"
"just slowly put that back on properly"
"and it's going to read around about 88"
"to 89 handler per screen area so when i"
"plug the power back in and you'll see"
"i'm not going to change any things at"
"all i'm just going to plug it back in"
"and you'll slowly see this will"
"automatically ram itself back up to its"
"rated knitted rice now this one's rated"
"to 250 nits of brightness as you can see"
"this just slowly bring itself up to the"
"brightness"
"for it and you'll go past hopefully"
"about 250 i know it's gone past 250 it's"
"up to 276"
"candles per screen or 275 candidate per"
"screen which is a 275 digit brown so"
"i've got an extra 25 nits of bronze"
"fantastic"
"but"
"it will be on power and then once i just"
"take this off power to pull the power"
"cable and you'll see it actually"
"automatically ramp itself back down to"
"88 nits of brightness at its maximum"
"i've shined lights over it just to see"
"if there's any sort of"
"thing to do with ambient light but no it"
"doesn't really change that maximum"
"looking goal on battery is 88 knits or"
"89 nits of brightness so this is a bit"
"of a worry when you're actually out and"
"about and especially in daylight"
"it won't be a very bright screen at all"
"so hopefully we'll find some"
"information from lenovo to see if we can"
"actually get this thing changed i did"
"perform the benchmarks for this"
"particular computer here now this one is"
"configured with a ryzen 5 4 500 u"
"processor with 8 gigs of ram and 250 gig"
"ssd hard drive and here are the pass"
"mark scores"
"3d mark"
"pc mark 10"
"crystal disk mark"
"geekbench"
"and matlab 2020b"
"inspect view prep"
"this computer i have been very impressed"
"by especially how cool this runs as well"
"how quiet it runs and it's got very good"
"performance as well and especially for"
"the price is amazing so and the build"
"construction is great very durable"
"computer here i can easily recommend"
"this lenovo thinkpad"
"e14 gen 2 amd version it's really really"
"good computer especially i am pretty"
"blown by this in a way"
"if you find this video informative"
"enjoyed it or even just to support my"
"channel"
"hit that like button for me and if you"
"haven't already subscribe to my channel"
"but hit that subscribe button as well i"
"do try upload a new video every week and"
"just remember imperfections in life"
"makes it beautiful and interesting i'll"
"see you next video"
"that is"
"[Music]"
"what"
"you are going to live life"
"today is an exciting day you know that"
"i'm interested in finding the optimal"
"the ultimate laptop for myself it has"
"changed so much over the years at some"
"point i kind of zeroed in i targeted my"
"focus on think pad products because i"
"like a nice and substantial keyboard but"
"i don't want a super heavy"
"fat laptop that would typically be what"
"would include a nice keyboard i had the"
"x1 carbon many generations the x1"
"extreme today"
"i have in front of me the latest"
"innovation in the thinkpad lineup this"
"is the lightest"
"thinkpad they have ever done it is 1.99"
"pounds"
"it's a type of thinkpad it's the type of"
"laptop that's going to encourage you to"
"move it around just because it is so"
"light they've also used materials here"
"to give it a certain amount of"
"durability there's carbon in here i'm"
"hoping the keyboard feels as good as the"
"previous ones have it's also got"
"thunderbolt on it which you guys know"
"how i feel about thunderbolt"
"specifically thunderbolt 4 the latest"
"generation intel chips are inside of it"
"depending on how you configure it and"
"supposedly it's got over 17 hours of"
"battery life it is the x1"
"nano lots of exciting things"
"i don't know what it says on the box it"
"doesn't even it's so new so recently"
"launched this could very well be my next"
"laptop my next go-to"
"let me pull it out"
"oh that is tiny this is a oh my even"
"with the foam on it"
"holy"
"wow"
"what it feels like nothing it feels like"
"i'm holding an ipad but i'm holding a"
"whole entire"
"windows laptop that is incredible"
"all right i don't want to give it all"
"away i'm going to just look at the other"
"items in the box i'm going to lay that"
"down for a quick moment"
"it's pretty bare bones"
"so as mentioned it's a 65 watt power"
"brick you can use the type c power brick"
"from lenovo that's included in the box"
"but"
"it's a usbc"
"chargeable laptop so if you have one of"
"those fast charge power bricks that"
"maybe you use with your phone"
"one of those gan chargers you could use"
"that as well and get something even"
"tinier than this although the included"
"charger is pretty tiny as well in here"
"let's look around the device over here"
"on the side you see those"
"two thunderbolt 4 ports that i mentioned"
"and a headphone jack that's actually all"
"you're going to get as far as the"
"interfacing is concerned bit of a"
"drawback compared to the other models"
"but a consequence of getting that almost"
"impossible size here at 1.9 let me put"
"this in perspective for you"
"1.99 pounds the regular x1 carbon which"
"is already ultra portable is 2.4 pounds"
"the competing product from dell is"
"around 2.6 pounds it's almost a half"
"pound lighter than everything it's"
"competing with it's obviously lighter"
"than the macbook equivalent it's just"
"it's pretty crazy it's pretty wild you"
"can tell that i'm pumped up apparently"
"they worked on the audio as well which"
"is a big consideration for me i i can't"
"stand the tinny audio on certain laptops"
"let me open this up wow"
"just like all the other think pads an"
"incredible range on the hinge which you"
"look at that it can basically fold flat"
"you have of course a little cover for"
"the front-facing camera which is nice"
"from a privacy perspective more speaker"
"grills up here a large precision track"
"pad fingerprint unlock plus the"
"mechanical buttons which are a nice"
"little extra to have i usually map them"
"to just be"
"extra buttons as opposed to necessarily"
"having them left right"
"center button and of course you gotta"
"have the little"
"you gotta what is the name of this nub"
"you gotta have your nub all right"
"because it's a thinkpad after all that"
"is"
"that's like a cutting board it's so"
"thin and light"
"my goodness let me tickle these keys"
"just a touch"
"and yes"
"the quick brown fox is alive and well"
"the way they shape the keys now this"
"one's a little bit smaller than what i'm"
"used to on x1 carbon but barely"
"[Applause]"
"you are going to live life with this"
"keyboard and no moment in time would you"
"be sitting there saying i gotta get my"
"full-size keyboard out because"
"this it really tricks your brain"
"you're still getting key travel which is"
"so unusual on laptops in 2020 you just"
"feel right at home when you use a"
"keyboard like this one of course you"
"also have this really stealth like"
"design"
"matte black finish which is almost has"
"like a rubberized feel to it plus some"
"call features in the quick settings up"
"along top that's because you can"
"configure this model with 5g as well and"
"be completely off the grid or away from"
"wi-fi but still connected let me go"
"ahead and power this up the power switch"
"is over on the side"
"wow"
"that was nintendo like on the startup"
"11th generation up to core i7 processors"
"windows 10 pro obviously intel iris"
"graphics so integrated graphics you can"
"configure the display for touch or"
"non-touch they're both dolby vision"
"whether you go with the touch screen or"
"the non-touch screen and 450 nits of"
"brightness which i track this stuff i"
"like to use a laptop next to the window"
"so i care about the brightness level"
"450 is on the higher end of the spectrum"
"certainly especially for such a thin"
"display with such a tiny little bezel"
"you can get up to 16 gigs of memory on"
"here up to one terabyte of pcie ssd"
"storage has mentioned up to"
"17.3 hours of battery life that's very"
"specific lenovo 17.3 very interested in"
"the dolby atmos speaker system can they"
"deliver on a package that's so thin and"
"light can you really fit speakers in"
"there if they're half decent i'll be"
"okay with it in exchange for the"
"portability wi-fi six is built in and as"
"mentioned 5g as well"
"uh for connection via sim card i suppose"
"maybe it has an e sim because i don't"
"see a sim"
"tray over there"
"[Music]"
"all right so we are booted up it is a"
"matte finish on the display let me get"
"those knits going sometimes with a matte"
"display you don't really fully"
"appreciate how bright it is because it"
"doesn't have that extra punch that some"
"gloss gives you"
"however what you do get is"
"a sort of more uniform experience"
"because you have less reflections"
"i'm a fan of a matte display i'll take a"
"matte display no problem on the top lid"
"here there are four separate microphones"
"they took the video conferencing"
"potential very seriously obviously"
"they're targeting a work clientele and"
"another nice little touch on the"
"thinkpad logo over here we have the red"
"light indicating that it's turned on"
"above the eye inside of the logo"
"now what's unique about this laptop is"
"that"
"even though it's a 13-inch laptop"
"because they went with a 16 by 10"
"display top of the screen is actually"
"the same height as a 16 by 9 14 inch"
"laptop so you're only losing some width"
"now for productivity tasks that's not"
"really a big deal"
"that audience tends to like a slightly"
"taller display because of the type of"
"content that you view like say websites"
"for example which are typically a little"
"taller than video"
"content that is the most aggravating"
"sound"
"in the world"
"and it always like crackles the speaker"
"a little bit"
"because they didn't tune it correctly"
"full resolution 4k playing will do has"
"his very own colorway of later case for"
"a later case this laptop is so light i"
"can hold it out here i can't tell you"
"for days quantities that are left"
"because so many of them you have uh four"
"separate speakers so you have speakers"
"here which are going to give you"
"uh sort of more detail for dialogue"
"firing into your left and right ear and"
"then for a little extra bass these two"
"guys are going to hit the table and"
"honestly for a 1.99 pound laptop"
"i'm going to take that sound i'm going"
"to say it right now this sounds better"
"than some laptops i've tested that are"
"quite a bit bigger so they did think"
"about sound and i appreciate that"
"because for a while lenovo wasn't all"
"that interested in delivering too much"
"sound to you because they thought okay"
"this is a work device take it easy you"
"don't have to be watching these videos"
"very loud but that feature mattered to"
"me so i believe they have kind of"
"rectified the situation on that front"
"with this laptop windows hello tons of"
"options for unlock i typically will have"
"a couple different ones enabled so the"
"fingerprint scanner is one but so is the"
"face unlock in windows hello that one is"
"super quick if i ever switch back to a"
"mac laptop i often miss that i'm gonna"
"go ahead and try the fingerprint on this"
"one here we go now lenovo has put the"
"fingerprint scanner in this position for"
"a while"
"and"
"it's looking for the scan"
"and you're in my favorite setup for"
"these is a is a dynamic one where i have"
"multiple options for unlock and then"
"just whichever one kicks in first i'll"
"just go if i hit enter and it happens to"
"see my face okay perfect if i'm kind of"
"off angle or something and i use the"
"fingerprint perfect i just like having"
"more than one option for unlock i use it"
"on a regular basis i'm curious about the"
"front-facing camera because video"
"conferencing has become such a huge part"
"of our lives in 2020"
"and this four microphone array so i'm"
"gonna go ahead and launch a front camera"
"recording so"
"here we are this is just the camera app"
"within windows oh it's got some sort of"
"a noise cancelling thing going on i can"
"tell it's dipping the ambient noise"
"in between words one of the reasons you"
"have these multi microphone arrays is"
"often for a sort of noise cancellation"
"functionality in order to determine"
"what frequency the background noise is"
"and to kind of attempt to get rid of it"
"we're going to be testing out the"
"microphones on the laptop as well as the"
"front-facing camera for video"
"conferencing purposes regardless of"
"which conferencing app you choose to use"
"you might be curious about how you're"
"going to come through on"
"this laptop if you happen to pick it up"
"so it's not the most tremendous"
"resolution i don't know what they list"
"it as it must be maybe 720p they don't"
"even list it on here oh it's an hd"
"camera with ir as well and think shutter"
"that's the thing that allows you to"
"cover it up with an actual mechanical"
"switch and cover uh it looks like 720p"
"to me so don't get your expectations too"
"high but it should work for your various"
"video conferencing and it's a it's a"
"good location you know some super thin"
"and light laptops i've had to move the"
"location of the front camera but"
"this is where it should be up on the top"
"of the display the quick brown"
"fox the"
"quick one of the things about a laptop"
"keyboard"
"is"
"it's not just the travel in the keys but"
"it's also whether or not the whole thing"
"flexes"
"as those keys travel downwards and often"
"when you're dealing with something so"
"lightweight it's tough for them to"
"figure out"
"a way in which to"
"deter"
"the chassis from"
"bending down"
"one of the ways that lenovo does it with"
"the thinkpad lineup is they use some"
"exotic materials like carbon and"
"magnesium and a variety of high-end"
"materials that are super lightweight but"
"also stiff and strong and so as you can"
"see even though this thing is not even"
"two pounds as i quick brown fox it"
"there's no i'm not completely i mean"
"there's a little bit of flex in there"
"but it's nothing substantial now you"
"also know that i'm a huge fan of"
"thunderbolt seeing as how with a thin"
"and light laptop sometimes it's not"
"going to be the most"
"overpowering thing from a graphics"
"performance perspective but when you"
"have thunderbolt 4"
"my goodness you got a lot of potential"
"expandability with tremendous throughput"
"you could get crazy and do some egpu"
"stuff if you wanted you could get crazy"
"and do some capture stuff if you wanted"
"so there's flexibility once you have"
"that port and believe it or not it's"
"kind of a tough port to find every time"
"on every laptop you might happen to be"
"looking at"
"this is way heavier all right i grabbed"
"some comparables because i this is just"
"it's so interesting to me"
"sort of what the ultimate computing"
"device is gonna be just in my life and"
"it's gonna be different for everyone"
"depending on what you do on the"
"day-to-day for me the day-to-day there's"
"email"
"there's of course i gotta get into slack"
"and see what everybody's talking about"
"there's some youtube there's a lot of"
"tagging different things and uploading"
"things i'm just interacting with a"
"keyboard a lot i need a nice screen and"
"i want something ultra portable and"
"relatively durable so now you know why"
"i'm such a fan of these things but for"
"some people that are in this market"
"they're going to cross shop it against"
"something like this which is a macbook"
"air but funny enough the macbook air"
"actually feels heavy next to this it's a"
"whole pound heavier how crazy is that"
"it's a 13 inch laptop it's a whole pound"
"heavier now granted it's different"
"materials this is using an aluminum body"
"so it kind of has a its very own"
"luxurious feel to it"
"and there's a much bigger bezel around"
"the display it's a glossy display the"
"keyboard is a totally different type of"
"setup as well bigger track pad they're"
"targeted maybe at different individuals"
"but i could imagine that cross shop and"
"in that case"
"if you're looking for an ultra portable"
"i have to imagine you're looking at that"
"weight if it's going to go in a backpack"
"if it's going to move around with you an"
"extra pound"
"it's uh"
"you know this is two-thirds the weight"
"of this it's quite substantial and then"
"the other crazy thing is once you get"
"into"
"an ipad setup this is a 12.9 inch ipad"
"pro with the keyboard attachment and"
"obviously this is a more versatile"
"device because i can"
"pull this off put it back on"
"and"
"have the magic keyboard attachment"
"to do my typing and touch screen and i"
"could have a pen with it as well but"
"it's kind of amazing how heavy this all"
"gets when you put it all together so the"
"ipad on its own"
"is 1.4 pound"
"this is 1.4 pounds this is 1.99 pounds"
"so"
"the difference between this and the"
"macbook air is a pound the difference"
"between these two items"
"is about half a pound point six pounds"
"put that in perspective"
"because you can't feel this"
"that's insane"
"imagine it's"
"slightly heavier than a 12.9 inch ipad"
"pro with an entire keyboard and then if"
"you want to attach the ipad pro to the"
"keyboard and have a all-in-one solution"
"for when you need to do some typing let"
"me see how much the magic keyboard ways"
"macbook air is 1290 grams and this"
"combined weight is 13.51"
"so"
"this package is more than a pound"
"heavier than this one and you end up"
"with a 13-inch display"
"a keyboard in this case you can also get"
"a touch display i realize they're very"
"different targeted differently this is"
"like sort of a mobile os with the"
"potential for pen input and so on"
"so it's going to depend on what type of"
"work you do but for me that's just"
"staggering"
"what they were able to pack in here"
"at this weight and i'm very excited to"
"use this more extensively you're going"
"to see it on my desk downstairs on the"
"loo later set and i'm going to be going"
"back and forth with this this will be"
"the daily and i'm gonna hardly notice"
"that i'm carrying it and also last thing"
"i just noticed there's the sim card tray"
"so yeah crazy 1.99 pound thinkpad x1"
"nano"
"look at this look a few of these two"
"this thing feels like a tank oh that's"
"ridiculous"
"oh my god i know i'm throwing this thing"
"i know it's crazy"
"yeah that's nuts"
"yeah you really feel like you want to"
"get up and move go to a different spot"
"go to the kitchen go to the especially"
"with that little charger"
"you could do anything you go anywhere"
"you can do anything"
"hello everyone and welcome back to"
"another episode of gizmo joe today we're"
"going to be"
"uh looking at a lenovo thinkpad e14 gen"
"3. now i know and i apologize that this"
"is a bit hard to see um i don't have my"
"standard tripod handy because i'm"
"visiting my parents in the states"
"so just bear with me but basically what"
"we're going to do today is we're going"
"to essentially upgrade the ram and put"
"another solid state drive in here so"
"basically"
"you can get this in a variety of"
"different configurations this is the amd"
"ryzen 5"
"but it only has 8 gigabytes of ram and"
"it's only got a 256 gigabyte solid state"
"drive on the inside now obviously you"
"can pay more to have 16 gigabytes or"
"whatever"
"but i chose not to do that because it"
"was"
"sort of expensive to do those upgrades"
"direct from lenovo and i said to myself"
"you know what i can"
"probably just upgrade that stuff myself"
"save myself a little bit of cash so"
"that's what we're going to do"
"we have an 8 gigabyte ram module"
"that's ddr4 obviously it's a sodium"
"because it's a laptop and we're going to"
"be installing that to bump up the ram"
"from 8 on the inside of this device to"
"16 total and then we're also going to be"
"taking this m.2 drive which is a one"
"terabyte micron drive and installing"
"that as well so we're going to leave the"
"256 in there but it's got a separate"
"slot somewhere around here"
"for"
"another solid state drive which is what"
"we're gonna do and we're gonna just use"
"that one for storage so what we need to"
"do is uh there are a bunch of screws"
"there's one here one here"
"and one here one here one here one here"
"one here"
"so it's about uh seven screws total and"
"we're gonna remove those screws and then"
"we're basically gonna pry this back"
"panel off now from what i understand and"
"from what i've seen sort of uh"
"you know red on reddit and forums and"
"whatnot is that there are sort of"
"latches that keep this back panel down"
"so even when you take the screws out it"
"wants to stay together"
"so you just have to take a little bit of"
"time to pry that off so that's what"
"we're going to do i'm going to grab a"
"screwdriver we're going to undo these"
"screws and we're going to try to peel"
"this back panel off and"
"hopefully it will be all right"
"okay so once you remove the seven screws"
"on the back panel what you're going to"
"want to do is you're going to want to"
"find"
"the little seam which is right here i"
"know it's really really hard to see"
"but basically what you're going to do is"
"you're going to basically pry this"
"corner up now i could get my fingernail"
"in there i don't have very long"
"fingernails but i could get it in there"
"and manage to pry it up and then what"
"you want to do is you want to carefully"
"work your way around just peeling that"
"back housing off of or the back plate"
"off of this sort of like housing here"
"going to be really really careful"
"because there are sort of plastic"
"latches on the inside here that will"
"catch so what i recommend is getting"
"yourself like a little plastic shim uh"
"and then using that to sort of pry it"
"open and just carefully work your way"
"around the entire unit and then the back"
"plate should just peel right off and"
"then we'll be able to do our upgrade"
"okay so now we have the back panel of"
"the thinkpad e14 gen 3 off now like i"
"said you have to be really really"
"careful because there are sort of like"
"clips that hold the back plate in place"
"just carefully work your way around find"
"a corner that kind of you can peel up"
"with your fingernail or something like"
"that get a bit of plastic and just work"
"your way around and eventually the back"
"plate will come off i will say though"
"that it is"
"tedious it does take a little while um"
"you know it does feel like you need to"
"force it a little bit but trust me if"
"you just keep uh working at it going"
"around it will eventually come off so"
"basically what we're looking at here"
"is right here is"
"the solid-state drive where the"
"operating system is stored like i said"
"mine's a 256 but right over here is"
"where we can install our"
"m.2"
"2280"
"drive so that's basically just going to"
"slot in right there and i'll do that in"
"a second but what i want to show you"
"first is under this sort of aluminum"
"heat shield here we can pry this up"
"because this is where the ram is so what"
"we're going to do is"
"we're going to essentially pull this off"
"and once i do i'll show you and we'll"
"install our new ram module okay so as i"
"mentioned before you basically take this"
"heat shield off you can it's it's not"
"screwed down or anything like that it's"
"just basically held down by"
"these little pins here you can just you"
"know if you can get your fingernail"
"underneath there it should pop right off"
"otherwise like i said you can use a"
"little bit of plastic to essentially pry"
"that up but as you can see there's eight"
"gigabytes uh soldered onto the"
"motherboard but we do have an empty slot"
"so that's what we're gonna do we're"
"going to grab 8 gigabytes of ddr4"
"ram this is 3200"
"megahertz which is exactly the same as"
"what's going on there so again you know"
"ryzens they benefit from more ram and"
"that's obviously best to have them sort"
"of in dual channel mode so hopefully"
"this will give us a nice little"
"performance boost now i have crucial"
"here i bought this off of amazon it was"
"pretty cheap i think it was only about"
"35 us bucks or something like that if i"
"can get it open i can show you how to"
"install this thing it's not terribly"
"difficult but basically we just take"
"this guy out"
"if i can get him out"
"and that's our little ram module and"
"what we're going to do is we're just"
"going to flip it around so obviously"
"it's asymmetric the pins here so you"
"can't put it in"
"you know one way or the other it only"
"goes in a particular way and basically"
"we're just going to slot it in right"
"there"
"make sure it's seated properly push down"
"and these two clips will snap in place"
"and that means that your ram is now"
"seated properly so what we've done is"
"we've taken an 8 gigabyte"
"to a 16 gigabyte and that should really"
"help with performance anyway let's move"
"over to the solid state drive"
"installation next okay so as i mentioned"
"before as you can see i've popped that"
"heat shield back on but as i said before"
"this is where our m.2 drive is going to"
"be so again this particular laptop it's"
"the e14 gen 3 comes with 256 gigabytes"
"uh pre-installed but what we're going to"
"do is we're going to expand that storage"
"space by popping in one of these guys"
"and that's just an m.2 drive and like i"
"said this one's a one terabyte it's a"
"micron"
"and yeah it will give us a decent amount"
"of space so if you've never installed"
"one of these before basically they kind"
"of look like a stick of gum or something"
"like that but you need to essentially"
"undo this screw here"
"which is what we're going to do right"
"now we're going to pop that out"
"pop that off to the side don't lose that"
"because we definitely need that screw"
"right and then what we're going to do is"
"we're going to take this guy and we are"
"just going to"
"slot him in right here"
"so press in firmly"
"it should see okay"
"and then that screw that we unscrewed"
"before we're going to pop it right back"
"because that's what's going to hold this"
"drive in place make sure it doesn't move"
"around"
"and if i can screw it in"
"and there you go so it's seated properly"
"it's not going anywhere now what we're"
"going to do is we're going to put that"
"back"
"panel back on and then fire this guy up"
"and we can format our drive and we're"
"going to double check and make sure that"
"you know it's reading the 16 gigabytes"
"of"
"ram as opposed to eight anyway stay"
"tuned"
"okay so i fired up my laptop it turned"
"on so that's a good sign and i know it's"
"a little hard to see but basically you"
"can see here in the about section of"
"with the windows settings is that"
"obviously it's recognizing that i have"
"an amd ryzen 5 5500u with the radeon"
"graphics and we now have 16 gigabytes of"
"ram it says 4.8 of that is usable that's"
"pretty typical"
"so obviously it is recognizing that ram"
"module and we're good to go now what"
"we're going to do next is just check and"
"see if it's recognizing that other"
"1 terabyte drive and so as i said before"
"my c drive that's where the windows"
"installation is and basically"
"we have if i hit properties here we're"
"looking at a 237 so again like a 256"
"gigabyte solid state drive"
"i've used about 70 gigs i've got 166"
"left over now that one terabyte drive"
"that i put in was actually from another"
"laptop so it also had another"
"build of windows on there which i'm"
"going to wipe out and just totally clear"
"off"
"but for right now as you can see it's"
"showing as the d drive the other"
"solid state drive that we just installed"
"and as you can see here it's a one"
"terabyte so we're looking at 931"
"gigabytes so again everything has"
"gone smoothly"
"all you need to do is just take your"
"time peeling that back panel off and you"
"should be good to go you can upgrade"
"your ram and you can pop in more storage"
"to put"
"the back panel back on just you know"
"again set it on and then just snap it"
"closed"
"and then put those screws back in and"
"you should be ready to roll anyway"
"hopefully this is uh going to help you"
"guys uh with your own upgrades on your"

"don't buy if you want to brighten"
"content creating capable display"
"overall we recommend the thinkpad e14"
"with a tiger lake for surfing the web"
"and office computing duties with a bit"
"of light gaming thrown in as an added"
"bonus"
"however the laptop is not ideal for"
"rigorous video editing and image editing"
"jobs"
"thank you for watching if you like this"
"video please make sure to give it a"
"thumbs up and subscribe"
"[Music]"
"you"
"hi there i'm guessing that you like i"
"was is currently searching for a new"
"laptop to use either"
"work in school or maybe at home"
"i was scrolling through the different"
"manufacturer's sites and i was mainly"
"looking for a quite powerful laptop that"
"could last me a good three years"
"while not being too expensive so i found"
"the likes of the ideapad 14 with amd"
"the hp envy x360"
"and yeah the idea pat it's great but"
"it's more focused on home use"
"the envy meanwhile was more expensive"
"and the version i was looking for in"
"particular"
"was currently out of stock so when i"
"spotted this"
"thing pad with a competitive price tag"
"and top level specs"
"i was sold so now i welcome you to this"
"casual review"
"the brand new lenovo thinkpad e14 with"
"amd"
"ryzen 4000 and make no mistake"
"this is not just another variation of"
"the intel model"
"but a completely new version the"
"thinkpad e14"
"generation 2. so it now comes with"
"support for dual channel memory"
"a backless keyboard although optional"
"for some markets"
"and a second m.2 slot instead of the"
"rather space"
"eating 2.5 inch cage from before"
"so that sounds like some steps in the"
"right direction"
"but before we get into it we've got to"
"unbox the damn thing"
"all right let's talk build quality"
"so it's the cheapest thing pad and that"
"immediately comes with some downsides"
"but in my opinion there isn't a lot that"
"i can truly complain"
"about with this device it's made out of"
"aluminium"
"and abs plastic so it feels solid"
"but with the hinge you want to make sure"
"you got both hands available"
"because you can't open this laptop with"
"one hand and holding a camera at the"
"same time"
"well it requires three hands so"
"this thinkpad e14 gen 2 packs the 8 core"
"ryzen 7 with integrated graphics in you"
"the screen has very small bezels all"
"around"
"while the top and bottom one are"
"slightly chunkier"
"the reason being that up top we've got"
"the web camera with ir which allows for"
"windows hello"
"then there's the beloved thinkpad"
"keyboard which still feels amazing to"
"type on"
"the trackpad is unfortunately not very"
"good though by today's standard status"
"okay so now we're going to know the"
"laptop a bit with some first impressions"
"but to really get to know it we need to"
"dive deeper"
"[Music]"
"let's start with going over the"
"internals"
"so we're rocking the amd ryzen 7 4700u"
"processor with integrated graphics that"
"means"
"eight cores eight threads two gigahertz"
"base clock"
"up to 4.1 gigahertz max boost clock"
"which is quite impressive"
"we got 8 gigs of ram it's ddr4 and is"
"running at 3200 megahertz"
"we've also got one empty sodium slot so"
"you can have up to 24 gigs"
"of ram in dual channel storage wise"
"we have the first hard drive which is a"
"512 gig"
"pcie m.2 plus we've got an empty m.2"
"slot if you want to expand"
"the battery is a 45 watt hour"
"so it's decent size charged at 65 watts"
"which allows for 80 in just"
"one hour via usb-c"
"the claimed battery life is 10.7 hours"
"so i would expect some around six or"
"seven and all of this is running on"
"windows 10 pro so that's"
"nice and to top it off we've got the"
"display"
"so this one is a 14 inch"
"full hd ips"
"with anti-glare and a brightness of"
"250 nits which is"
"honestly not that great but"
"it works fine for me in terms of"
"ports we've got one usb 3.2"
"type-c generation one with the function"
"of"
"power delivery and displayport 1.2"
"we've also got one usb 3.2 gen1"
"it's always on and an hdmi 1.4"
"b"
"and then a combined headphone and"
"microphone jack"
"on the other side we got one usb 2.0"
"a flippy down ethernet port and a"
"kensington lock"
"simple as that"
"let's move on to everyday usability"
"everyday tasks such as browsing reddit"
"and watching video"
"feel incredibly snappy thanks to the"
"high boost clock of a ryzen 7 processor"
"the display gets both bright and dim"
"enough for most environments"
"except for maybe being outside in direct"
"sunlight"
"if you feel the urge to furiously type a"
"notepad"
"or maybe not but perhaps compose a"
"document in word or google docs"
"then i can happily report that this"
"keyboard still"
"is the best on the market for long"
"typing session"
"and then there's the webcam and"
"microphone"
"and they are"
"less than average and average"
"by today's standards is still terribly"
"low"
"so you won't be taking any"
"fancy meetings with this"
"setting up the laptop for the first time"
"was rather quick and simple"
"it was not running a recent version of"
"windows meaning"
"some updates were due but when those are"
"done"
"you're greeted by the lenovo wallpaper"
"and a pretty clean install"
"you've got the likes of lenovo vantage"
"and mcafee pre-installed"
"but not much more so basically good to"
"go"
"moving on to gaming even though this"
"laptop isn't made for gaming"
"the integrated graphics can handle"
"titles like league of legends"
"cs go and rocket league by pumping out"
"60 plus"
"fps medium to high settings"
"in league of legends i managed an"
"impressive"
"87 fps on pretty high settings"
"in cs go it was also very playable"
"not as high but still mentioning"
"over 70 fps at 79"
"so nearly 80. and in rocket league"
"well it's a bit more demanding but"
"still very playable at its"
"56 fps"
"[Music]"
"in cinebench we can see that the 8 core"
"ryzen 7"
"beats out even desktop cpus from not"
"that long ago"
"which is impressive the only place we"
"haven't looked is"
"inside it's that easy to get open just a"
"couple of screws to undo"
"inside you can see the second m.2 slot"
"which is the full size one"
"under here we got the sodium slot and"
"what keeps it cool is the two heat pipes"
"compared to the intel versions one"
"and for me it hasn't got uncomfortably"
"hot even under low"
"so now let's get this thing back in one"
"piece and wrap up this review"
"[Applause]"
"to end it all i want to talk about is"
"this laptop the one for you"
"well if you want a powerful well-built"
"machine with an a-plus keyboard then"
"yeah this is for you"
"you would honestly be hard-pressed to"
"find another laptop with"
"zero big compromises this does it all"
"pretty well and i see no real reason"
"to go for the thinkpad t-series over"
"this"
"neither the ideapad 5 maybe the nvx360"
"if you value the screen a lot"
"but otherwise for this price it's"
"incredibly good"
"and has my full recommendation well done"
"lenovo"
"and thank you so very much for watching"
"this review of the thinkpad e14"
"don't forget to hit that like and"
"subscribe if you enjoyed watching this"
"and it helped you out stay safe and i'll"
