This was serious enough to wreck the reputation of even established players, and they really started kicking it once they moved to crisis management mode. The decision to discontinue this phone was simply brilliant...any other choice would have been catastrophic. Their communication after x2 was great, and they went the long mile with the fire-resistant shipping materials they spent a fortune on to get the devices back...which was a sold investment as as a high-profile incident during return (though unlikely given the lack of charging) could have been the nail in the coffin.

THEVICTORYMAN,I gave my galaxy note 7 to Samsung to refund or . Atleast fix it . Bc it was completely disabled by the new update. I wasn&#39;t able to use it at all . And than Samsung never gave my phone back. . Only thing I did wrong was . Gave the phone back to samsung in December while the phones note 7s were blacklisted months before .,2019-04-30T18:34:07Z,0,0,,,,

Armand Guanlao,"Hi guys! So I was planning on getting the Note 7, but sad things happened with the cease in production and selling. I am thinking of getting an LG V20 or a Pixel XL right now since they&#39;re quite the latest bunch (and I do not regularly buy new phones, it&#39;ll be better for me to buy the latest models) but I am also looking back into the Note 5 if it&#39;ll do. Actually the S-Pen is a great deal for me, I really want it but I am hesitant that the hardware may get dated about now. Any tips? Thanks in advance!<br><br>Edit: the Note 5 here is quite cheaper compared to the (supposed) price of the incoming LG V20 and Pixel XL here by about a third.

Navid,I think you are the best tech reviewer on youtube- your videos are excelent!<br>But just one thing:  <br>I have owned an android and an iphone. The experience of the iphone was a lot more satisfying for me. (the android gets annoyingly slow after a year. But I still use my iphone 5s with the iOS 10.) My android phone was Moto atrix- and also a samsung galaxy S4. On the S4 it takes 4 seconds to take a picture!- that is how slow it is. <br><br>What I am saying is that I think you should account for the fact that android phones do not keep up with the updates and they will be a lot slower after some time than an iphone for any reason cause someone like me plan to keep the phone for a year or two.,2016-10-11T17:42:28Z,0,0,,,,

This should do the same, ESPECIALLY since the display is edge-to-edge. Wouldn&#39;t you agree? Not sure if that&#39;s an Android problem or a TouchWiz problem.",2016-09-30T19:57:57Z,0,4,,,,

,,,,,ijirving,"@XxiKarlosxX xoxo Didn&#39;t say there wasn&#39;t a reason not to upgrade, just that I didn&#39;t have one personally. My phone isn&#39;t a fashion accessory, so I don&#39;t really care what it looks like (its a black rectangle, looks like a phone, good enough), I&#39;ve almost never used the speakers, just use headphones. Battery life can suck a bit, but it gets me through the day easily enough with moderate use, that&#39;s all I need. But it has a replaceable battery should I never need it. Note 4 has microSD expansion also, unless I&#39;m confusing you. I&#39;ve had a 32GB chip in since I got it and could upgrade, but I don&#39;t really save much shit on my phone.<br><br>The only negatives you said were the looks (which I don&#39;t care about), the speakers (which I don&#39;t care about), and the battery life (which I agree with). <br><br>Not gonna drop $800 for 12 more hours of battery :)",2016-10-01T12:00:01Z,2016-10-01T12:00:01Z

I  couldn&#39;t even type normally because the keyboard input was really lagging. But after clearing the cache, the free ram increasd up to 1.5gb and the keyboard is acting normally again.

,,,,,mcool93,"theTrophyMachine - league of legends, I am no expert at remembering all features from apple and Samsung/android, but I do remember that Samsung first had waterproof (in non-active versions) in S5, and then lost it in S6, and then re-add them on S7. So it&#39;s not really water resistance for 4 years... Maybe you can use SONY as an example since they had water resistance since forever.. Some features did come out on apple first such as replying directly to a txt msg that pops up from the notification bubble without leaving the app you&#39;re in, but of course, android phones get the majority of &quot;new&quot; features first since android oems can modify android as they see fit. As far as I know, apple&#39;s brand is a &quot;luxurious&quot; brand so you will never get to buy a &quot;cheap&quot; product from them if you want &quot;value&quot;. Fwiw, Samsung note 7&#39;s starting price is even more expensive than iPhone 7 plus starting price. Brand image does have a cost. Samsung can try all they want, but the majority of image conscious people (such as celebrity) use iphones. Samsung also isn&#39;t helping itself by having constant deals for its flagship phones and always giving gifts (gift card, or vr headset, or memory card, or other incentives), it&#39;s cool for value conscious people but for image conscious, they&#39;d rather buy THE brand that doesn&#39;t devalue itself through constant rebates and selling cheap products. For me personally, I&#39;d rather buy a nexus for value as I&#39;m guaranteed to have faster and more os updates, and get an iPhone for brand image.",2016-10-04T06:48:45Z,2016-10-04T06:48:45Z

It just did not feel like writing on glass. Plus the entire G5 glass is complete shit imo, less scratch resistance which means even change in your pocket will .....WILL scratch your phone even with the screen protector on.

Austin Flygare,"Honestly, I disagree with you on the tossup between the s7 edge and the note 7. I received an s7 edge as a loaner during the recall and I was very disappointed with the device&#39;s performance. I may have gotten a bad unit but the one I received got warm much faster than my original note and was much warmer overall with any sort of moderate use as well as wireless charging. The phone lagged quite often too, especially when bringing up the keyboard on screen and the battery life was miserable. Wrapping an 8 hour work day, my note was generally around 57% is percent, while my S7 Edge was consistently around 35%. I had everything set up almost the same for both devices but the S7 always seemed to burn through battery awfully fast for sitting in a pocket. One day it actually became so warm in my pocket that I was worried about permanent damage to the device, it was EXTREMELY hot to the touch just from sitting IDLE! Overall though, I&#39;m VERY happy with the Note 7 and this is coming from a person who I had the iPhone 4, 4s, 5, 6, 6 plus and 6s plus as well as more than a handful of Android phones including the galaxy s5, s6 droid incredible, droid RAZR and a few others.

Marx Domah,Overtime I&#39;ve been a dual platform user; always had a note along with an iPhone. I let go of my note 5 and settled down with my iPhone 6+ 128Gb. <br><br>I want to upgrade but the new iPhone has a major drawback for me. I always use my phone in be while it&#39;s plugged in to watch YouTube. I keep my audio private with a pair of Apple earphones. If I upgrade to the iPhone 7 I&#39;ll need a pair of wireless earphones that I can conveniently use while plugged in. Not sure if that is possible. Else I might be forced to add an adapter to the already heavy iPhone. <br><br>I&#39;m thinking of getting the note 7 instead but I&#39;m worried about the explosive battery. I have nothing against android.,2016-09-28T04:23:46Z,0,0,,,,

They look great but not as natural as they should, just take a picture of red flowers and you can tell easily.

,,,,,magicalpony,"@Lukel Well with a phone like the One Plus 3 your getting a phone which has almost no bloatware on it compared to LG G2 which is why your phone felt laggy a month and a half later. With an android phone you can always get a custom rom which u can never do on an iphone. And as someone who uses android who also has had an iphone/ipod/and ipad imessage isn&#39;t a huge loss because of all the other messaging apps there and plus unlimited texts is like standard these days. :/  And like Wasiq mention u need a headphone jack and android even has mods with the moto z force. The new nexus&#39;s phones come out in a couple days too so theres a phone which will have better hardware than the iphone. Plus lets admit ios is years behing android considering all the new features of ios 10 has been out for years on android. You have an infinite choice of phones compared to two iphones. Way more affordable. THings like launchers, roms and google now is bae. Sorry this post is an unorganized mess :P wh",2016-09-28T02:07:49Z,2016-09-28T02:07:49Z

I absolutely adore the Android operating system, and it is years ahead of IOS, but it just doesn&#39;t matter to me. I&#39;ve tried putting a Rom on this phone, but putting TWRP is a giant pain in the ass and no matter how many hours I spend trying to do it, i end up not being able to install a Rom anyways.

,,,,,magicalpony,beautiful thing about a nexus phone is it takes like 5 mins to install twrp and flash a ROM maybe less. also who needs a better processor for multi tasking when u can just so split screen and plus if ur going to say graphics Samsung&#39;s screen is way better,2016-09-28T03:59:18Z,2016-09-28T03:59:18Z
,,,,,Jacky Fu,"It&#39;s up to you but I personally like iPhone. Apple still provides software updates to their old phones, upto the iPhone 5 (I think). unlike Samsung and many other android companies. They lose support after one or two years although you can always flash rom, but that&#39;s not my thing and it takes like two or more months for the phone to get updated once Google releases a andriod new version. I don&#39;t think you should switch just because you like facetiming and messaging, there are many apps that provide that for free although it requires Internet and also for the other person to get it. There are a lot less feature on the iPhone but I don&#39;t use most of the feature on androids anyway like screen casting, multi window (having two apps open at the same time). iPhone is definitely faster then android although I don&#39;t think you will notice it much. It loads app quicker, turns on faster but it&#39;s not a realy big difference, it&#39;s  only a few second difference which you won&#39;t notice. The build qualities are nice whether your buying a iPhone or any android cause it&#39;s 2016 now.",2016-09-28T08:18:35Z,2016-09-28T08:20:01Z
,,,,,Wasiq Rashid,since you&#39;re having trouble with twrp I would recommend the oneplus 3. installing a custom ROM on that phone is as easy as 123. in the end it&#39;s also faster than the note 7 and you can get way more updates through CyanogenMod. in the end it&#39;s your choice...,2016-09-28T10:02:21Z,2016-09-28T10:02:21Z

Carl Bin,"3 points I&#39;d like to add for Note users. 1 is the USB C, using the provided adapter I was able to connect a 1Tb external HDD &amp; transfer movies, music and large files flawlessly. My iPad Pro can&#39;t even do that. Secondly, I was able to charge my wireless headphones with the phone which I think it&#39;s a great perk. Last point is a negative which you mentioned is the snappiness of opening &amp; closing apps. Sometimes there&#39;s a stutter which such a high-end phone should not suffer from. Apple still does that better even on older phones like iPhone 6. I have had all iterations of the Note &amp; this by far has been the best experience.",2016-09-27T22:12:23Z,0,0,,,,

williada williams,"Yo, I want to commend you my friend for giving a honest , non bias, samsung bashing review. You could have easily swayed many  people by simply advising them to steer away from Samsung phones. The same unfortunate events could happen to apple, LG, or motorola. Being that I haven&#39;t upgraded my phone since the G2, which is what I am still using today, I was considering buying this phone until the unthinkable happen,  although expensive. Now, after seeing your video I may reconsider. But what do you think about the Miu 5s plus and the UMI plus? Can you do a review of those phones? They have great specs and half the price of ios/american android phones. Thanks.<br>Will",2016-09-27T18:47:56Z,0,0,,,,

,,,,,Borgar Løvold Ihle,"Carlos Alberto Morales Well, I guess it all comes down to personal preference and needs. I need a smartphone that can read and edit documents, while also being fast and simple. The iPhone 7 Plus does all of these things brilliantly. As for the stylus functionality, I don&#39;t think I would use it enough for it to be worth leaving what, in my opinion, is one of the fastest and simplest smartphone operating systems out there. The multitasking feature is a nice bonus, but still, with only 5.7 inches of screen estate, what more productivity you can get out of this function is very limited. I have an iPad Air 2, and even there, with a 9.7 inch screen I&#39;m still finding things a bit crammed together when I use the multitasking feature. I always plan things in advance, so i rarely find the need to quick charge my phone right before trips or in the morning. As of now, the only thing I hope for from Apple is the wireless charging. Other than that, I think the iPhone 7 Plus is the perfect smartphone for me, with a simple and snappy OS that utilizes all the potential power of the phone, while looking stunning at the same time. But I also think the Note 7 is a great smartphone with lots of functionality. Then again, if you really need a portable office, why not have something like the Surface Pro? There are limitations to what can be done on a smartphone, and I think an Ultrabook or a Notebook is the best option if you&#39;re going to do really heavy work on the go.",2016-09-28T18:16:13Z,2016-09-28T18:16:13Z

tttekev,"Great review as always Marques, keep up the good work! A few things though. <br><br>1. This is most likely a bug with Samsungs aggressive power management features when the device is locked. They majorly downclick the CPU in order to save battery life. The problem by doing this is if a computational task is already going on when you&#39;re unlocking the phone, it will lag until the unlock process completes and up-clocks the processor to typical levels. Samsung is probably more aggressive with this on the Note because of it&#39;s smaller battery. You&#39;ve probably noticed it with a handful of Android devices. <br><br>2. I&#39;m guessing that you&#39;re writing this review before the water-resistant iPhone came out. But the speakers on the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are amazing with water-resistant speakers. So at least in my opinion, the lower, tinny sound from the S7, S7 Edge, and Note are no excuse at this point.",2016-09-27T16:22:39Z,0,0,,,,

302 Onewheel,"I used to love his channel.  There isn&#39;t really anything special about it anymore.  His reviews come later than everyone else&#39;s, and by the time he does publish them we basically know everything about the phones already (aside from the fact that he got the IP certification number wrong in this one).  Yes, the camera quality in his vids are good, but so are most YouTube tech reviewers nowadays.  Should we should expect his LG V20 review some time in January?  Let&#39;s go, Marques.  You were the top tech reviewer on YouTube for good reason.  You stood out.  Now some clown who bent an iPhone is labeled as the top tech reviewer.",2016-09-27T15:10:04Z,159,22,,,,
,,,,,Daniel Tejada,This video particularly probably took longer because of the recall. I was waiting for it too but I did get why it had to be delayed. Besides he does have to take time to thoroughly review everything about the phone and even included the issues about the battery and waited for his unit to be swapped out for a new one. That for me was a smart move. And he always provides us with the best content anyway so I guess that makes up for it,2016-09-27T15:20:43Z,2016-09-27T15:20:43Z
,,,,,Mayuresh Patel,I&#39;d say his reviews are about how they fare after a certain amount of time. What if the device quickly drops off in performance. A lot of people want to be the first to put out content with which they don&#39;t get a good enough experience with the products. Or maybe he doesn&#39;t care about being first.,2016-09-27T16:14:33Z,2016-09-27T16:14:33Z
,,,,,302 Onewheel,"I get both of your points (very valid!), however what did he say in the vid that was so different from everyone else&#39;s that DIDN&#39;T wait a bit to publish?

,,,,,arsalan660,"I like his reviews because he use the phone and then reviews it and tell how it perform after sometime not like others who just get the phone and review, because some phones may look good at start but after some use you will find more about them, so it&#39;s better to use first and then review it.",2016-09-27T16:46:33Z,2016-09-27T16:46:33Z

,,,,,Pure Luck,"like the others say, he uses the phone first. The reviews may not differ much from others but you know he uses it first and gives a review based on his experience. For example he states that sometimes when he opens the Note7 it lags a little bit at first. I have the S6 and that happens to me too now and then, so it let&#39;s me know that samsung still has that issue. It&#39;s the little details, it&#39;s no biggie, but I feel MKBHD tries his best to give a good, honest review not to be 1st and get views but to inform his audience.",2016-09-27T18:28:43Z,2016-09-27T18:28:43Z
,,,,,arsalan660,"@Pure Luck​ well said, also people who reviews early didnt know there is battery issue once people start using it then it was found.

At the end of the day it doesn&#39;t matter how late he drops the video because it&#39;s more than likely gonna be a different set of points than a video made by Jonathan Morrison or EverythingApplePro. Which they were different. EverythingApplePro said the camera performed worse than the Apple iPhone 7 and overexposed and over-sharpened the images. In this video, MKBHD said it is the best camera on the market.",2016-09-27T19:05:29Z,2016-09-27T19:05:29Z

Remember that term if you ever have a real job and get feedback from clients or colleagues.  Judging by your avatar, the amount of makeup you have on and the Mariah Carey background pic, it seems like you&#39;re too occupied with celebrities and their looks... you know, the superficial items in this world to understand was positive critique is.

Malatech,A lot of people like to Argue APPLE or SAMSUNG. But numbers don&#39;t lie. APPLE sells more phones for a single company. Its the #1 phone company in the world. Look guys Samsung is good but its just another Android. HTC is better honestly. Samsung major problem is they went with Android instead of doing their own things like apple did. Androids are quantity over quality. And that&#39;s what i hate about ANDROID.,2016-09-27T14:49:21Z,0,0,,,,

,,,,,Rey Runs,+jeffluis91<br><br>Definitely I will replace it once the new batch of Note7 arrives in store.  I used it as my daily driver just because it is more convenient with 2 SIM card slots that I put an Internet SIM on card slot 1 and Call&amp;Text SIM on card slot 2.<br><br>It is convenient for the fact that with Note7 I don&#39;t have to bring 2 devices like I used to have had Note5 and Nokia Lumia 1020. The wireless charger adds convenience too which I use one at office and the other in my room. <br><br>The water resistant feature makes me more at ease when I brought my phone in toilet that I don&#39;t have to worry for water just in case there&#39;s splash or it swum in toilet bowl. lol,2016-09-27T17:11:02Z,2016-09-27T17:16:24Z

Why can&#39;t we set the default file path in certain apps to save files or photos on just the SD card? Instead, the only option you seem to be left with is moving them over manually, but if you move folders to the SD card, apps still save files/photos on the internal storage, creating two locations for everything...which can be annoying. Additionally, you can&#39;t remove apps from the device entirely when moving them to the SD card. Every time the app updates, it all migrates back to the internal storage.

The quality of the apps are just so below what I&#39;m used to and the so lag just ruins the experience for me.

Mohammed,"You forgot to mention this so you can make your phone a bit more faster.<br>Tap the build number for 7 times to enable developer options. Once you&#39;ve enabled developer options, develop options will appear in settings just above the About device option. Open developer options scroll down till you see the 3 animation&#39;s and make them from 1x to .05x and it will increase tour speed. Also to root your device and you have the Fap lock on so it wont work so turn it off by doing this: Tap the build number for 7 times to enable developer options. Once you&#39;ve enabled developer options, develop options will appear in settings just above the About device option. Open developer options, the 4th or 5th option should be “OEM Unlock”.

The only reason I have a Note 5 is because someone gave it to me for free and it was an upgrade from my iphone 5.

,,,,,Fatehali Golani,"Firstly, stereo speakers on iPhone 7 are much better than that of note 7. Secondly, a 3500 mAh battery is smaller on a phone that has 5.7&quot; QuadHD Super Amoled screen, along with an iris scanner and unoptimized apps that uses a lot of battery. And if this phone is attacked by a POWER USER then u can pretty much determine how long this baby would gonna last. S7e has 5.5&quot; Super amoled screen and has 3600 mAh battery! wtf Samy..",2016-09-27T13:52:38Z,2016-09-27T13:52:38Z

,,,,,Fatehali Golani,"No man 3500 is not enough for a power user!! Yeah that&#39;s the point, Samy never puts a good battery in their flagships like note 7. And people what they can do, they just had to bear with the device which Samy makes. Bro, just use your logic: Is 3500 mAh enough if u play too many games, watch videos, use snap chat, twitter, Facebook etc, use iris scanner, take photos and vids on a huge display that would probably eat a lot of battery!!",2016-09-27T14:38:48Z,2016-09-27T14:38:48Z

We are best friends, but you don&#39;t know that, lol (because I have heard you talk more than any other friend, hahaha.) I still have Note 4 and have been waiting for the upgrade. I skipped Note 5, because they disappointed me (not because it wasn&#39;t a major upgrade from mine, but because they left so much opportunity out they could have done.) So the S7 came out and got me excited the Note 7 was going to be brilliant. Remember how Notes piloted all the best of the best and it wasn&#39;t the S Series? Well, not the case any more!<br><br>Okay, so why didn&#39;t I give it a thumbs up? You waited forever. I&#39;m sure u needed to see what was going to happen about the explosions. And I defended Samsung until my brain hurts. They have so much to do to change their reputation from this, it hurt them so bad. But I couldn&#39;t get one when I was defending them, Oct. 4th and Google has me waiting, and now hearing about the S8..........makes me not want this phone again. Knowing they have to do alot to redeem themselves, I thought there would be some great bargains (throw in that charging case for your lame battery or give me 6 Gigs to say &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;) Alas, no. I&#39;m so frustarted, typing anything further sounds like whining. 1.) Please don&#39;t wait this long again for EVERYONE&#39;S daily driver. 2.) Another elephant not addressed is should I buy the plus sized 67 over this, since it is everything and a better battery and cheaper or are the perks really worth it? 3.) Don&#39;t tell us what we already know for 85-90% of the video. Those who watch your videos aren&#39;t really new to these phones. We need your insight from owning it and using it like a boss.

Like In Islam my friend was saying killing an innocent person is like killing all of mankind meaning you r so sinful. She was saying it&#39;s a.... Major sin(?) and yh.

eneidvaddeu,"You see Marques... I have an HTC One M7, and comparing its display against my friend&#39;s Galaxy S6, it shows the better sharpness on the HTC, despite the Samsung having the higher resolution and PPI. So I was wondering if that&#39;s because of the Pentile matrix on the S6. I mean, it&#39;s quite evident the HTC having the sharper display when comparing with my own eyes, and since the S6 has almost the same display as the Note 7... what do you think about this?",2016-09-27T11:18:49Z,0,4,,,,

Matthew Moscotto,Samsung Lag. Even MKBHD mentioned it. Daily use can be irritating especially when you wake your device up and the phone is stalling and jumpy trying to catch up with user input... and also when your notification shade gets choppy. The Note 7 is a great device however but Samsung has not married the optimizations properly with Snapdragon processors and it&#39;s pain to see other companies like HTC and LG along with Google Nexus devices run smoother and snappier than Samsung&#39;s offerings especially for the price Samsung wants you to pay. I will be waiting for the S8. I returned my Note 7 for a refund a month back. I&#39;m hoping Exynos makes it to the S8 in the US Version.,2016-09-27T10:56:35Z,0,0,,,,

,,,,,Wrathzy,"Just Genetic I find it hilarious that you bring up specs because apple every single year destroys every other phone on bench tests with less specs. Look at the octo core s6 vs the dual core 6s, still murdered it. Wireless headphones are a hell of a lot better then wired, but the adaptor means you can still use any aux if you want to go back in time. As for your pen thing yeah I got to admit I&#39;m really sad about not being able to scribble on my screen :( I would have actually used that every single day. Battery life, like everything is Samsung phones, might me bigger/have more but look at real stats of how long it lasts.",2016-09-27T14:54:44Z,2016-09-27T14:54:44Z
,,,,,Channel Name,"First Off: There is a reason no one uses benchmarks in reviews anymore they are not correlational. Find me a 2016 phone reviewer that pulls up Geekbench. iOS and Android OS process work differently so having a higher geekbench score clearly does not mean better multi tasking.<br><br>Second, wireless will never be better than wired. If you understood frequency ranges you would know that. If wireless was &quot;a hell of a lot better&quot;, apple would not have included an adapter in the box. Before you say they added the adapter to please fans, no. Apple doesn&#39;t do that. Apple knows people who buy their products dgaf about technology and will buy anything they put an i in front of.<br><br>The pen is cool, I&#39;ve always used note phones and don&#39;t use it much. But if youre gonna throw in a free stylus that I can put in my phone I will more than gladly take it. That&#39;s smart business.<br><br>Battery life, Samsung phones have bigger batteries but the battery will drain faster because our screens have higher resolutions. WE have adressed this by adding in not only fast charging but effortless wireless charging too. Apple still can&#39;t charge wirelessly or fast. <br><br>Another day, another apple fan boy taken to school. If you lasted this long, I congratulate you.

,,,,,Wrathzy,"Just Genetic hahahaha, Apple fan taken to school ay. You are hilarious I have to admit, you put a good effort in that para. Apple is Intel, Android is AMD. If Apple used the same specs as Samsung need to even be on par with the speed and processing power of a iPhone, I think it would be able to teleport. I&#39;m well into tec let me tell you, I own more phones, more tablets and more headphones then you just to name a few. I run a iPhone 7 along side the Note 6 as a spare phone. Anyone that is truly into tec can appreciate the pros of iOS and android, Apple and Samsung. Both have plenty of great things about them. But as for my preference being with Apple and iOS, it&#39;s simply faster, more reliable, uniformed, quality control. Android is quantity over quality and you know it. Year on year, Samsung have more specs and worst performance, in every aspect, day to day use, gaming you name it. As for wireless, I was talking about he average consumer, listening to music etc with no wires IS better. If you want to jump into the hard specs and hard detail of it, yeah no shit wired is better. As for wireless charging, it&#39;s something I would like in an iPhone as I use it on my wireless devices but apple being apple is developing its own form of wireless charging they don&#39;t have to pay another company to use. SAME exact thing for the screen res, apple are developing their own (more superior) screen technology called Micro-LED that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t jumped on OLED. I have a Samsung OLED TV and yeah it&#39;s insane but there are reason behind why they aren&#39;t using it. OLED has its flaws. Smart business? Apple creating their own form of wireless charging and own screen technology so they don&#39;t have to pay another company for using something they made, that&#39;s smart business. <br><br>You aren&#39;t going to take me to school buddy I know all there is to know about both flagships, I can appreciate both for what they are like I said. Anyone into tech who is above the mental age of 10 enjoys seeing tech progress regardless of the company. Heck I&#39;m still hoping windows makes something of their OS as they have so much potential there.",2016-09-27T15:44:35Z,2016-09-27T15:44:35Z
,,,,,Wrathzy,"Just Genetic the basis of the comment was simply, why has Samsung compromised on the speaker such a big part of a phone when Apple has added another speaker (which both sound great) while still being water resistant. But as the guy said it&#39;s because Note 7 is more water proof. Without throwing any of this android warrior shite out",2016-09-27T15:50:06Z,2016-09-27T15:50:06Z
,,,,,Channel Name,Agree to disagree with your knowledge on tech. <br>Android chose to sacrifice speaker quality to attain water proofing while Apple decided to sacrifice its head phone jack to attain water proofing. No one expects great quality from phone speakers and Apple believes no one needs a head phone jack on their phone 24/7.,2016-09-27T16:02:10Z,2016-09-27T16:02:10Z

andyH_England,"It is not worth the price. Full stop. It is bias to suggest it is IMO. By release time in Nov (UK) at £850 it will have a year old chipset that has been superseded. All it has over the S7 Edge is the S-pen and if that is not your thing then the gimmicks like the iris scanner are not enough for the £400 extra it costs over the S7Edge. Bearing in mind the battery life is much better on the s7 Edge and it is a better performing phone with few issues this is a very one sided review. No mention of the sub par performance on anything intensive, terrible RAM management, disappointing battery life (many reviews struggle to get 3-4 hours), scratchy GG5, only 4gb RAM, no options for 128 or 256 GB storage, USB-C data rates seemingly not up to standard, etc. You can still support Samsung but a balanced review is always better, and this was not IMO.",2016-09-27T10:24:51Z,0,1,,,,

When making phonecalls I keep pressing my ear against the phone and thus changing s... up, starting apps etc. Auto brightness dims my screen all the way down where if im outside i can see anything. only remedy is to restart but it only helps for few minutes. tried back to factory several times with clean installs (not from backup). still nothing. please help.",2016-09-27T09:42:09Z,0,0,,,,

I noticed it was very &#39;noticeable&#39; during the first week and a half of use. After that the issue is not really there anymore unless I reality stress the phone out.

They also have a pretty decent resell value when the time comes.

Android is a little confusing at first but once you get a hang of it&#39;ll be an amazing experience! Apple is a little simple, that&#39;s what I like too. I personally prefer android, maybe try to go to the actual shops and get a feel of both. I like the ecosystem of the note 7 as well, I&#39;m a artist so personally I prefer the note 7 for the S-pen. Both are nice choices, however I&#39;m not 100% if I would go with the iPhone 7 because of the headphone jack, that&#39;s personal though, since I like to charge and use headphones at the same time. If you really want the iPhone 7 then get a wireless headphones also known as Bluetooth. I don&#39;t have a Samsung device right now, I did in the past. However I would say that the expandable storage is amazing. Samsung phones don&#39;t seem to have any good battery, at least in my experience. If you really want a Samsung an alternative is a power bank! I tried giving pluses and negatives of both phones :)",2016-09-27T11:29:19Z,2016-09-27T11:29:19Z

They said it might&#39;ve been the cause but it&#39;s not certain. Also, since the note 7 has usb-c, it takes more power from the charger and when you use a non-certified third party cable, that will cause major problems for the battery. Instead of bitching about all of this, I would rather praise Samsung for taking back ALL note 7&#39;s and exchanging then for a new batch.

I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be anything major, it is a thin device, please invest in a case and screen protector. My headphone jack is broken but Bluetooth headphones are the saviour. I&#39;m an android nerd, but I wanted to air 2 because I&#39;m open to try new devices. I don&#39;t know why but my IPad glitches when I&#39;m typing, actually it&#39;s happening right now. However, don&#39;t think this is negative because I really love this to watch YouTube videos, since it has a clean sleek design. I&#39;m also an artist so drawing with this is basically amazing! (I&#39;m saving up for an apple pen or an actual drawing tablet)  if you like to organize this is nice for that, however that&#39;s what an air 1 can do too. Overall I like the iPad it&#39;s not too &quot;distracting&quot; it gets the job done. However I don&#39;t know if you should buy this for anymore than 500 dollars. I have no experience with the note 7, however I do think it&#39;s nice to give a chance to android. Props to you! The note 7 looks so economical and so diverse. You can change the theme, but my main selling point is that S-pen. If I were you I&#39;d find a main focus for both devices: for me on the iPad Air 2 was gaming and YouTube, and for the Note 7 is the S-pen (again I&#39;m an artist) find something that suits YOUR needs.",2016-09-27T11:21:45Z,2016-09-27T11:21:45Z

,,,,,Lucky 8s,"Go with the S7 Edge because it&#39;s the smarter choice. Here are my reasons why:<br>*It is $100 cheaper with the same internals, minus the slightly smaller display (5.5 vs 5.7).<br>*The Note 7s CGG 5 is apparently super weak against scratches (from JerryRigsEverything&#39;s video). <br>*S Pen is useless for me. It&#39;s nice, but I&#39;ve never felt I need a pen for my touch screen. <br>*Bigger battery, which is crucial for gaming. <br>*No battery issues unlike Note 7. Yes there&#39;s a recall and replacement devices are being made, but Samsung just announced that they need more time. <br>*Retinal scanner? No, I don&#39;t want to give more biometric data to the government. <br><br>That&#39;s everything I can think of right now. Maybe there&#39;s a few more, but I think this is a pretty compelling list for the S7.",2016-09-27T12:56:08Z,2016-09-27T12:56:08Z

The damage to Samsung&#39;s reputation cannot be underestimated or fixed overnight nor will it not affect their sales. From a marketing and PR standpoint the exploding issue is a disaster and it will take time for them to regain trust of the market place. It&#39;s a brilliant phone but you wouldn&#39;t trust an expensive Jaguar or Rolls Royce series with a reputation for exploding in hot weather. sadly the Note 7 can now never be considered the best phone of 2016 or the best Galaxy Note ever, that prize will remain with the Note 4 which Samsung still sells to this day. the two Subsequent versions of the Note series have been blown up stylus versions of the  S6 and S7 series albeit with excellent hardware.

,,,,,Michael,"mehrab que, you don&#39;t understand optimisation do you? And no but I think most consumers would at least like to move their app icons to where they want on the homescreen. <br><br>Tuan X, no apps and UI run just as smooth on both platforms it&#39;s app loading times where iphone is better than android though seems to be on par with general apps like facebook but games iphones seem to load them much quicker though frame rates in games seem to be better on iphone too again down to optimisation it&#39;s like playing a game on pc optimised for AMD graphics cards will most likely get worse frame rates if played on a Nvidia graphics card. And it&#39;s highly limited like I say you can&#39;t even move the icons about to where you want them and try copying an MP3 from your iphone to a friends PC. You&#39;ve obviously been sucked into the apple ecosystem and now you&#39;re locked in it. Airdrop is merely a bluetooth file sharing which any other phone even non smart phones have but apple has decided to not allow file transfer over bluetooth forcing you to use airdrop which only works on apple devices (no surprise there). Google hasn&#39;t really got an ecosystem at least no a limited one you either have a google email account or you don&#39;t otherwise the ecosystem is what you want it to be you don&#39;t have to use any google product to get a connected system but for example I can use google docs to write something and go from android to a windows PC or to even a Mac, using apples word processing apps (forget what it&#39;s called I know one is keynote i think) but you can only seamless switch to another device if it&#39;s an apple device like a mac or an ipad. <br><br>Kinda agree with apps looking better on IOS but androids apps are getting to look just as good and it&#39;s subject to what app you&#39;re using some look better on IOS and some look better on android take instagram and facebook for example they look near enough identical on both platforms. And yes some apps will run smoother but like I say android seems pretty good now in terms of smoothness it&#39;s the app loading times that iphones beat android and I have near enough all the apps I used on my iphone on my s7 edge and none really differ in features.",2016-09-27T09:39:57Z,2016-09-27T09:39:57Z

Because Apple integrates hardware AND software it will always have the best versions of apps. Also, some people don&#39;t care about customization. Seriously how often do you change your phone layout? Furthermore for people who keep their phone longer than 6 months the iPhone ages better.

Facebook loads on my note 4 in a second that&#39;s more than fast enough. I don&#39;t like IOS or iphones because I have used an iphone 5s and ipad air 2 and I just felt limited even though both were jailbroken which seriously hindered the reliability and speed of my iphone by having all the tweaks I had on it that even my S4 had out of the box. <br><br>I don&#39;t like that to do something as simple as copy an MP3 from my laptop to my iphone I have to mess around going through itunes or if I need an emergency USB flash drive I can&#39;t use my iphone.

,,,,,Michael,"+Tuan X, Optimisation easy to understand and I studied IT for 4 years pretty sure I understand it and here in the UK optimisation is spelt with an &quot;S&quot; in the USA it&#39;s spelt with a &quot;Z&quot; so my spelling is correct. Once the app has loaded which takes no more than a second in most cases on android the apps run fine there is no difference in smoothness for things like animation or scrolling. It&#39;s a rarity in my experience for any phone to lag though every phone I&#39;ve owned including iphones have lagged not as much as androids sure, but have still lagged iphones have specific hardware and software whereas android has a wide range of hardware even just like the note 7 has a snapdragon CPU for some countries and a Exynos CPU for other countries and that&#39;s just one phone so optimisation will be difficult to do, this is also one reason developers make apps for iphone than android as well as a better market as statistically there are more people with iphones than android so from a developers point of view iphones are the better platform to develop as more people will buy or download their apps. <br><br>You&#39;ve basically proven my point as you&#39;ve clearly brought other apple products I&#39;m guessing mainly because they work well together so you&#39;ve technically been made to buy their products just to get a seamless experience and adding to my original point, it&#39;s the only way to do it. I for one like choice I don&#39;t want to have to only be able to send a picture through MMS if I haven&#39;t got internet connection on android I have the choice of using bluetooth to send a picture providing it&#39;s not an iphone that I want to send the pic to as iphones won&#39;t allow me to send files to or from them the only other way is NFC, again another thing iphones don&#39;t have the capability of using except for payment. But I have the choice of also using MMS or social media. Same with MP3 files, I have that choice to stream music or just transfer files easily with a windows pc or a linux pc or a mac. I&#39;m not restricted by apples control. <br><br>And of course you can move icons as in rearrange them but try having just say 8 most used icons at the bottom of your screen allowing you to see more of the wallpaper up top for example. And you may love the fact that all your apps are there on the home screen but again it&#39;s that lack of choice that annoys me about iphones I have no choice but to do it apples way and I can&#39;t change that unless I jailbreak which the average consumer wouldn&#39;t do. <br><br>If apps are starting to look identical then there is no issue lol the only app I miss from iphone is garageband otherwise android has the same apps or a good alternative for every app I used on iphone I did search for best IOS apps of 2016 a couple days ago to see if there were any really good ones maybe that weren&#39;t available on android and most were also available on android and ones that weren&#39;t available either had alternatives for on android or just something that for me personally didn&#39;t need or want though obviously this is subjective. <br><br>I forgot to mention things like micro SD card support on android, you may say that so much memory isn&#39;t need or that you have cloud storage but it allows android users to buy the cheapest storage option available and then add to it when and if needed and isn&#39;t something that requires internet connection to work especially if I&#39;m out somewhere where there is poor 4G or even 3G connection. But my point is iphones don&#39;t give users much choice it&#39;s apples way of doing it or no way unless you go the jailbreak root.",2016-09-27T10:47:23Z,2016-09-27T10:47:23Z

Thing is I can say crap about iphones bending despite the high price tag etc but I won&#39;t because I have better things to say crap about with iphones hence why in non of my comments so far have never mentioned the bend gate as an argument for iphones being worse than Samsung phones (I would have said android but there are android phones that bend too)",2016-09-27T11:02:58Z,2016-09-27T11:02:58Z

It&#39;s not something Apple or iPhone users made up. Android lags. Why would someone prefer iOS, some dumbass asks. Well coz it works better. If u like to change your icons to your favorite Pokémon skins then fine, Lots of people don&#39;t care about customization . Then battery life is not a reference anymore like older notes were. Then to me, I really don&#39;t like the displays. Samsung displays are like Beats. Everybody talks about them, tons of people have them and love them but they shit. Those colors are vivid yes, and in fact that&#39;s the problem. Colors look so fake. Sure spec sheets lover gonna be all over that display but for who really understands about displays and colors they now those amoleds do a pretty bad job. Spen, most people admit they never use it. So another fart feature. Yes great camera. Like many flagships have great cameras. You can give a phone the title best camera phone, but none really disappoint on the camera department. And to me the one on th LGs flagships is still the most interesting one. Updates, does this phone get regular updates when they come out? No. so like in the past when in face of a major security flaw u have to wait many moons until u see an update. So if there was only 2 phones in the market and if it was 6years ago, yes it would be the best piece of tech in the world. I would sell my soul to have it. We in 2016/17.

,,,,,Michael,"+Tuan X Of course optimisation has been an issue from day one and it always will be unless google make android work specifically with the hardware or make a standard that all android phones need to have a certain cpu etc. But there was a time when android would be so shit at even scrolling though I only ever saw the low end android phones but they lagged like crap even scrolling through settings. Now though even budget android phones have pretty smooth frame rates and the app load times aren&#39;t like a big enough difference it&#39;s not like androids take 5 seconds to load an app and iphones take 1 second. <br><br>Yeah you can use airdrop if you don&#39;t have signal but only to apple products sending a file to a windows pc or to android or a windows phone even you can&#39;t do. I don&#39;t share many files and quite honestly even when I had my iphone I still managed to get by though I did have tweaks through jailbreak to make file transfer better as back then I was at college and was a necessity now though not a big deal but again it&#39;s the choice and there will be that one time I&#39;m in a situation where the best form of sending a picture or a file is through bluetooth and I won&#39;t be able to do it on iphone if the device I&#39;m sending to isn&#39;t an apple product. <br><br>Same with MP3&#39;s, I hardly listen to music it&#39;s purely an example and yeah you can stream songs now and all sorts but it&#39;s the choice or lack of on iphones when I was so used to being able to just transfer a song from my pc to my LG KP500, when I got my iphone 4s it was a little frustrating that I couldn&#39;t easily get a song to show up in it&#39;s default music app without using itunes or jailbreaking. <br><br>Sure you can jailbreak iphones and get near enough the same customisation as on android but it hinders the phones reliability and you have to know what to do when the springboard crashes or goes into a reboot loop and for the average consumer isn&#39;t something they&#39;d be comfortable doing especially as apple won&#39;t sort it out if it messes up.

,,,,,Renato Pascoal,@***** it&#39;s very easy to answer your questions. I don&#39;t like iPhones much. I have an idea of what would be my perfect phone and none in existence achieve that. So with that said I go for the user experience and for me it&#39;s iOS. Even if next iPhone comes without jack and without speakers I gonna get one. Not because I love iPhones. Not because I love Apple. It&#39;s just I prefer iOS and how it works for me. Android is versatile but too slow. Currently I have iPhone 6 Plus and note 4. Flagships around the same time. Waiting for iPhone 7 Plus and maybe later will also upgrade the note. I&#39;ll change my opinions if it comes to that but so far it is what it is. Been trying the S7 and it&#39;s quite more of the same even if it&#39;s a lot better than my note 4. There are issues with android that mess with my work and daily life. Don&#39;t hate it but it&#39;s not for me. And on top of that I don&#39;t use Windows laptops so everything is a lot better for me having the same user experience and continuity between devices. That Apple does it like no one else. You have to give them that. I&#39;m very simple. It&#39;s not because I have an iPhone i say this. But I don&#39;t care about Fart features I&#39;ll never use.

,,,,,Michael,"+Renato Pascoal what is your idea of a perfect phone? What kinda issues do you have with android that mess with your work and daily life? Saying android is slow isn&#39;t really a point because sure Iphones are faster in most situations but it&#39;s not like a massive difference and in fact in some situations my note 4 would be faster than an iphone due it&#39;s software features. Say for example I&#39;m looking through my gallery for some reason I have a picture of a restaurant or maybe something about a restaurant comes up on facebook or google plus and I wanna find out what time it opens or closes etc. On iphone I have to come out of facebook, open safari, type the name of restaurant along with &quot;opening times&quot; and click search. On android I press and hold home button still in faceback, google now on tap comes up scans screen and with in a second or 2 it&#39;s given me info on the restaurant and tells me what time it opens and closes. But anyway iphones are faster yes but it&#39;s not like I&#39;m waiting 5 seconds for my emails to load on android so why is speed still an issue these days? Most high end phones are fast enough now whether they&#39;re android, iphone or windows phone.",2016-09-27T12:04:50Z,2016-09-27T12:04:50Z
,,,,,Michael,"+Tuan X yeah you can send files with dropbox sure or even through facebook messenger for example but again my point is choice as well as limitations. Say I&#39;m round a friends house, he has a song on his windows pc or possibly even a mac and he say&#39;s he&#39;ll copy it to my phone. Android plug in, copy and paste, iphone have to sync through itunes which I can&#39;t do as last time I checked it&#39;ll wipe phone and sync with friends itunes so I&#39;ll lose all my other songs. Or I could even bluetooth the song over from a windows pc to android or I can use online storage which just takes too long depending on the internet connection. <br><br>Again if we&#39;re talking about no signal, you&#39;re right you can send to other iphones and android can send to other androids but let&#39;s say I&#39;m with someone who has a windows phone or a blackberry or even just an old flip phone, iphones have no way of sending a file to them but on android you can through bluetooth it&#39;s that choice that you get with android.",2016-09-27T12:10:07Z,2016-09-27T12:10:07Z
,,,,,Michael,"+Tuan X, everything works seamlessly with android though that&#39;s the thing. Your devices work well because they&#39;re apple products which is great and if it works for you fair enough.  But I have a windows laptop, not all of my family have an iphone in fact only my dad does now, my brother now has an S7 my mom has some older nokia lumia phone so having an apple tv is pointless. So I have chrome cast. Does the same things near enough as apple TV yet my dad can use it on his iphone, my brother can use it on his S7, I can use it on my note 7 and my mom can use...oh wait she can&#39;t shes on windows phone -.- moving on, I can use it on my windows laptop, I can use it if I have a linux machine I can use it if I have a mac. Do you see my point? Apple tv is limited to apple only devices which is fine if you have other apple products but my family don&#39;t all have apple iphones and non of us own a mac and my brother has an S7 as well as an ipad yet chrome cast allows all of us to use it regardless of platform. <br><br>My android also works seamlessly with my windows pc that isn&#39;t a Samsung make either yet it works great together to the point where I can see my note 7 screen and control it remotely if need be and I can easily transfer files regardless of what they are. I can use google docs to seamlessly switch from windows to android to ios to mac to linux to continue working on the same document I can even share the document to someone else using a completely different platform to collaborate on the document. It all boils down to the fact that by using apple products and services, they all work great if I use them with other apple products but by using android and googles open ecosystem I&#39;m able to be flexible with what devices I use and share things with or what devices I can stream to and in fact the only reason apple products aren&#39;t more locked down than they are is because companies like google, HTC, Samsung etc allow their products and services to be used with almost any device, take android wear for example works with android and iphones they could have just locked it down to android only meaning the only reason you have a choice on what smart watch to use is because google has allowed it to work with iphones. Same with chrome cast, same with google docs and same with most of google&#39;s services. <br><br>Like sadly one of the apps I used a lot was garageband on iphone as I play piano and guitar it was great to be able to create songs with it but now I can&#39;t use it because apple have locked it to apple products only forcing me to have to buy an apple product If I want to continue using it apple know how to make money and they do it well by limiting user choice. If google made a similar music creation app it&#39;ll most likely be available on all platforms and even if it was just for android I&#39;d still have a huge choice of what phone I want to use.",2016-09-27T12:23:36Z,2016-09-27T12:23:36Z

Meaning to send a file for example I need to go through facebook messenger or some other online storage or social media service. Imessage is great not going to deny it but it only works across apple products which is why I don&#39;t really like apple as a company let alone it&#39;s products.",2016-09-27T12:26:09Z,2016-09-27T12:26:09Z
,,,,,Michael,"+Tuan X It&#39;s one of many examples and I&#39;m pretty sure you have times when you need to transfer files to and from computers to a phone. And no people don&#39;t share files but in the situation where it&#39;s needed say at work you&#39;re methods of file transfer or sharing are limited to mostly internet based solutions which can be slow and time consuming depending on how fast the connection is at college I was always having to transfer word documents and to go from the pages app to I had to install a jailbreak tweak I think because back in 2011-2012 pages didn&#39;t support saving to dropbox and even now it&#39;s still a few taps and steps to go through to get word documents to and from a pc at college. Again android just plugs into the pc as a storage device. <br><br>And why should I have to jailbreak a device just to do simple tasks that even old non smart phones are capable of doing? Again all your solutions require internet access which isn&#39;t always available and isn&#39;t always fast but you have no choice but to work in the limitations of apple products. And &quot;most people&quot; are just brought into apples ecosystem not because it works better for them or anything but because apple is a brand name is seen as the be all and end all of smart phones and therefore sells really well. One thing I hate about google is they&#39;re crap at advertising something apple is really good at doing. <br><br>You&#39;ve still not made a valid case for iphones being just as good or better than android, you&#39;ve managed to tell me to stop saying about file sharing and you managed to do what I used to do and just say &quot;well you can use dropbox&quot; or some other long winded work around for a stupidly simple task and made the kinda valid but not really relevant point of &quot;iphones are faster&quot; as it&#39;s like saying &quot;my car is faster&quot; yet it&#39;s only 20 mph faster and both can do the speed limit anyway making top speed irrelevant. If a phone can launch an app like facebook within 1-2 seconds depending on the app in question, then it&#39;s fast enough bit like your 1080p screens are good enough quality kinda thing.",2016-09-27T12:52:09Z,2016-09-27T12:52:09Z

Seems as if quite a bit has changed since I lasted used an iphone as back in 2012 pages wasn&#39;t available on windows via a web browser so I&#39;ll let you have that one though still seems like it doesn&#39;t work on android unless I&#39;m mistaken? Yes most companies do have their own software for their own hardware but it&#39;s minor things like take Samsungs Soundcamp the only app that comes close to apples garageband on android but it&#39;s only available on Samsung phones. But Samsung allows the gear S2/S3 to work on iphones and other androids, not completely closing it&#39;s ecosystem though will admit Samsung probably is the apple of android in this regard. <br><br>Android can match it in near enough every way if not more so with it&#39;s ability to interact with even non smartphones or linux pc&#39;s the only thing we&#39;re not allowed to use are apple products as in the apple tv and the apple watch we can obviously interact with macs to some extent. Otherwise we have access to near enough everything you get and more not to mention things like chrome cast aren&#39;t as pricey as apple tv&#39;s and while you can use chrome cast too if you have mainly apple products you&#39;re more likely to buy the apple tv over chrome cast meaning apple make money from this ecosystem they have because as you say you somewhat benefit from being part of it or seemingly you do would be interesting if you&#39;d buy androids if they were just as fast as iphones and worked with things like apple tv or if you&#39;d still stick to iphones. <br><br>But regardless of the ecosystem and just talking about the OS in general, even that is so limited on IOS and yes you can jailbreak but if iphones are aimed at most people then most people wouldn&#39;t be up for jailbreaking with a slight possibility of messing the phone up. But like I say you can&#39;t position your icons exactly how you want them, you can&#39;t split screen apps except on ipad pro (though until android 7 you don&#39;t get this feature unless you have Samsung phones), you don&#39;t get the control you get in the camera app again most people may not want manual controls but it&#39;s there if you want it or need it, you can&#39;t change the font type, can&#39;t change icon sizes or how many icons there are per row and column and you can&#39;t change the layout of the control centre.  That&#39;s just a few things I can think of from the top of my head oh and setting default apps.",2016-09-27T13:22:20Z,2016-09-27T13:22:20Z
,,,,,Michael,"+Tuan X did you not read my last comment, I gave you many reasons why even the OS in general is more limited on IOS than android. File transfer was an example sure everything syncs up online but for example got helmet camera for use on motorcycle has no app to view video files on the go so only option is to put micro Sd card into a device which you can&#39;t do on iphone it&#39;s an example a situation that COULD happen depending on the users life style sure not everyone has a helmet camera and not everyone is going to need to do this but that ability is there on android phones. <br><br>You talk about &quot;most people&quot; not wanting to customise there phone or transfer files yet most people don&#39;t use there phone for much more than youtube, webbrowsing, facebook, snapchat etc in which case any smart phone will work fine for this reason again the argument about speed is irrelevant you don&#39;t need snapchat to load in 0.01 seconds quite honestly even the iphone  4 is still fast enough and the and still is the galaxy S4 and so is the HTC M9 etc etc. They all load apps under 2 seconds for apps like facebook, internet, snapchat, apps that &quot;most people&quot; will use. <br><br>And that&#39;s just talking about &quot;most people&quot; let alone the power users or techy people who like using NFC tags, heart rate monitors, manual control over things like the ISO and focus in the camera, people who like to make their phone their own.",2016-09-27T13:35:05Z,2016-09-27T13:35:05Z
,,,,,Michael,"+Tuan X In when has split screen apps been laggy at least it hasn&#39;t been on my phones. And yeah you can get SOME camera control on IOS through 3rd party apps again it&#39;s another step on a &quot;simple&quot; device that I have to do to get something that&#39;s built in on most android phones and even then back when I had iphones at least I could never find an app that let me manually set the ISO. <br><br>Not as far as I&#39;m aware you can&#39;t change app icons you can set a zoomed in mode which enlarges them but you can&#39;t set a specific size and you would have only seen a small percentage of android users I for one have 8 app on my first page on my home screen, these are apps I use everyday and then on the second and last page I have S-note widget, and then 4 apps that I use quite frequently but not everyday. Then all my other apps are in the app draw in alphabetical order (something I can also change is the sorting of the app draw). I then have google play, SMS, app draw icon, google inbox and settings app in that order on my dock but again that&#39;s what works for me the beauty of android is that if I prefer apples layout I can install a launcher that replicates it or even in any other launcher I can set it to put all apps on my home screen. I can arrange icons in a way that is organised and easy for me to access my most used apps. <br><br>Again iphones aren&#39;t smoother they&#39;re faster in terms of animations the frame rates are identical and app load times are like a second or two slower on android in fact even the galaxy A9 pro managed to be near enough on par with the iphone 6s on every app except games which I was surprised at as it&#39;s not Samsungs top range phones. Though it is using a 1080p screen so has easier time rendering apps etc.",2016-09-27T13:47:48Z,2016-09-27T13:47:48Z

,,,,,Renato Pascoal,"@***** well I only mentioned the one I currently have, the note (4) edge. But if you interested then I will tell u a bit about that. Back in the days, before the smartphone age I was a Nokia guy! I had tons of Nokia. Some i still keep as collection items. At some point I had a used iPhone 3GS on the side but I hated it. More and more smartphones were already in the market when I was still rocking my last Nokia, the N8. Which still today I think it was a great phone that had some crazy features for the time. The camera was awesome (12mp with Xenon flash and even the autofocus focus orange light), the support it had for several peripherals was awesome (mouse, keyboard, PS3 remote, wii remote, etc), the dedicated hdmi port and 5.1 Surround support, the typical thin charger and the micro USB port on the side allowed to charge even when u were using the USB port for anything else. But that Symbian crap was horrible. Never Nokia had a full developed OS for touch screens, instead they insisted using that Symbian OS made for keypads but adapted to touch screens. It was horrible. Well they had the Maemo OS on the Nokia n900 (I still have it) and also the Nokia n9 with the developed version of Maemo called Meego. And meego was awesome. If they only had put the effort on that Meego OS maybe, just Maybe, we wouldn&#39;t have android as we have  today. But that&#39;s just me guessing a very hypothetic outcome.  So that and the fact they said NO to android from the start killed Nokia for me and, as we know now killed Nokia in the phones business. <br><br>At the time my dad had android phones already (android 2.0 era) but I didn&#39;t like it. So I went for the iPhone 4s when I had the chance and replaced Nokia for good. Stuck with that and later moved to android when I got  a galaxy s2. Loved that phone. But. But before the Galaxy i had a brief experience with a huawei budget android phone. At the time 4s had the amazing Retina display and it was mind blowing but that s2 amoled was something. Even if like I said before, i always twisted my nose to those color representations. But the android experience wasn&#39;t quite there yet for me. Don&#39;t remember exactly now what I had at the same time side to side but later went for the iPhone 5s and an Oppo find 5. Which had the first 1080p I ever had and an amazing build quality. And it was impressive. Besides we had the option of having it with their own Color rom, or with cyanogen rom with official support from Oppo. Kept it until I got the iPhone 6 Plus (at this time experiencing the 5&quot; inch size on the Oppo,  the iPhone 5s became very annoyingly small and it made me rush to upgrade to the next iPhone generation, which I never do). Gave the oppo to my mom (still using it) and then I got the note 4 edge. So iPhone 6 Plus and the note 4 are the phones   I have today. Also important to mention I have a contract that allows me to change phone (not counting the ones I bought to keep, iPhones and note 4) anytime I want, up to 3 times a year. So it is this perk I use to test many different phones over time. So brief contacts I remember 2 Sony Z, lg G5, galaxy s6, 2 Lumias and a galaxy alpha. Think that&#39;s it. <br><br>So now I&#39;m still waiting for my pre ordered iPhone 7 plus to replace the iPhone 6 Plus, and gonna be trying the S7 for some time to see if then I upgrade the android side to a note 7 when they stop exploding and the second wave of note 7 stop having also their own issues as some been coming up to the light of day. <br><br>So with this I hope u now understand my opinions are based on real experience and that I&#39;m not an isheep that only comes here to bash on android diehard fans. In all my comments I leave in android vs iOS stupid wars, I&#39;m saying iOS is immensely better for me. Not saying iOS is the absolute best OS in the world.

,,,,,Michael,"+Renato Pascoal I had the a Motorola Ministry of sound edition flip phone and then a LG cookie (KP500) before I got my first smart phone the Iphone 4s. I honestly hated android back then I just saw it as a cheap alternative to iphones, it was laggy as in even animations had shit frame rates and apps just seemed to be pure shit and I would defend iphone all the time like when wireless charging came out I just thought it was a load of crap though even now I still think it&#39;s a bit pointless as you can&#39;t use the phone whilst charging but think I might get one to sit next to my bed so it&#39;s more convenient to charge note 7 up overnight. <br><br>Wasn&#39;t until 2012 I was in my second year at college still using a jailbroken Iphone 4s would brag to a mate who kept switching from iphones to galaxy phones about tweaks I had installed giving me such and such feature near enough all of which she had on her galaxy s3 and s4. Around this time my contract ended and It was a choice between the new iphone 5 or switch to an android and galaxy S4 seemed the android phone I&#39;d go to as I already knew about it&#39;s features. Most people in my class had androids so I figured it can&#39;t be too bad now and even if I didn&#39;t like it I thought I&#39;ll just put up with it for a couple of years then get the next iphone in 2 years time. Needless to say I got the S4 and trust me I considered not switching as I was concerned that I&#39;d lose some jailbreak features like I had it set up where I could triple press the home button to compose a sms using chomp sms and wasn&#39;t sure if i could do that on android (turns out I can but don&#39;t use it lol). I never have thought about switching back since, S4 had all the features I had from jailbreaking and more straight out of the box and then next I got the note 4. <br><br>Again one thing I&#39;d say about android is with the notes how you don&#39;t need that big screen and the S-pen is stupid as you can get styluses for any phone though back then I wasn&#39;t aware of it&#39;s additional features and that it was pressure sensitive and since owning a note 4 I&#39;ve grown to like the S-pen it&#39;s not something I use everyday but the odd times I need to jot something down it&#39;s there or if I&#39;m bored and just wanna doodle for example it&#39;s there or if I feel like writing an SMS or facebook post instead of typing I can do though I hardly use it for that but the option is there lol. Other than that I&#39;ve got an ipad 3rd gen had that since around 2012-2013, got a nexus 6p brought it cheap from a friend and have a nexus 7 tablet too which don&#39;t work no more but think I might try and fix it not too bothered though as I use my laptop more than tablets. <br><br>Same here that I wouldn&#39;t say IOS is completely shit, it&#39;s not still some great features in IOS but for me personally I like the choice and customisation android gives me even the little things like where I want to place icons, I&#39;m allowed to arrange icons how I want on windows pc I would like the same on my phone and I just like the little features on Samsung phones and even HTC or LG phones that you just might not know about unless you own one like with the camera on Samsung has voice control so no need to awkwardly reach for the shutter button and when taking selfies you can use the heart rate monitor on the back as a shutter button again making it more comfortable to use just a couple examples.",2016-09-27T18:56:16Z,2016-09-27T18:56:16Z

,,,,,Renato Pascoal,"@***** i remember i wanted to go<br>For the s4 at a point but besides the spec upgrades everything new was just Fart features no ones uses unless they showing off to friends. Like stop looking at it to pause videos or make it go to sleep if detects u not looking at it anymore. And I never liked the Design of s3 and s4. Much prefer the design they had on s2 and later on s5. And until this point another common thing I didn&#39;t like it was the low cost plastic feel<br>Of Galaxy series. In this matter iPhones always looked more premium. Not considering the status thing it was to own an Apple branded product. At a point this was a thing. Not so much nowadays. But I never cared for the status a certain product may bring. Actually I hate that. People who bought and maybe even today buy, Apple stuff only<br>Coz there&#39;s a bitten apple logo on it. But i remember how it was to see someone with an iPhone before. Oh they must be a successful doctor or engineer to have one those. Nowadays with the contracts we get from carriers and easy credits major retailers give, now even kids have 1k phones easily.  Sure all brands have their own problems when Launching a new product like Apple had and have in their very expensive phones. And Samsung the same. But putting this to the side, even U must reckon until s6 came along, precious galaxy series looked cheap and in fact they sucked for the price tag they had. In terms of overall quality. Those Chinese look alike plastics (and maybe they were in fact Chinese) that wore off the color with time, or would gain the color from your jeans pockets. The failure with the water resistant s5 that was only water resistant the first 2 months until that charger port flap broke. And also the terrible touch wiz interface that i remember even when I had the first Samsung omnia (at this time fcking up the windows mobile experience instead the android experience). And that&#39;s one thing I like about Apple. They always late on tech and features. Hence the common jokes of android communities each time an iPhone comes out they compare it with an older android phone that had the same spec/ features. But when they do they do it better. Touch ID is a good example. They were not the First. But they made it useful and it worked like never before. Even first galaxies with finger print readers were only good to unlock the phone. Touch ID is integrated in iOS. It&#39;s much more than just a feature to unlock the phone. Not to mention in Samsung we had to swipe. So with this in mind how about oled displays and wireless charging? Why a 2016/17 iPhone doesn&#39;t have those? Maybe, and again I&#39;m just guessing, when they do include these features on the iPhone it will be something different and slightly better than what we are used to today. On the Display matter i have no clue on what they can do. But wireless charging in my mind it&#39;s something u could use by having your phone in your pocket while u in your living room and it&#39;s charging. This I believe it&#39;s gonna happen, being apple or not the firsts to do it. To this point of wireless charging I agree with u. That&#39;s y I say it&#39;s not useful coz when I charging my phone I still using it. And using a charging dock/pad it&#39;s practical coz u just put it there and it charges overnight but where u have that charging pad, you have charger with a cable attached to it which u can plug it directly to the phone. So wherever u charge your phone, next to your bed or on your office desk you still need that charger combo when using a pad or the cable plugged to the phone. And it still must be in contact with that pad. So calling it wireless is technically the truth, but practically is not there yet. And yes I know those voice features, when u can just say smile or take a picture or cheese to take  a picture. And that&#39;s useful. To this point all I can do is tell Siri to take a selfie but it just opens the camera ready with front camera. But to me the differences are bigger than that. I use a lot USB OTG. And another thing i still use a lot on my note that many people forget and don&#39;t even care when they have recent galaxy phones is the IR Port. My note is my universal remote and I use it a lot for that. So to each one of us different things matter. For example I don&#39;t give a flying big F to customization. Actually to me it&#39;s a bother to know what am I gonna use the home screens for. Maybe coz I&#39;m used to iOS, but on my note I use the main home page for the apps I use the most and the rest I just go to the app drawer and swipe left. Even if I have what I&#39;m looking for on the second home screen. Yes but I can totally imagine the opposite. Being used to home screens and then get an iPhone as a secondary phone and get annoyed coz I don&#39;t have that easy home screen access to my most used apps. That&#39;s something i use my edge screen for a lot. Edge screen on note 4 is a great feature and very useful.  More than on the newer s6 edge. Don&#39;t know about S7 or note 7. U had the note 4 edge? If so can you do the same stuff with it on the note 7? And the spen, as u said not something we use all the time but it&#39;s awesome it&#39;s there. I love using it.

,,,,,Michael,"+Renato Pascoal I wasn&#39;t big on the plastic build of the S4 either tho I kinda just forgot about it and in all honesty I had a plastic case on my iphone 4s so it felt cheap anyway so was used to it lol haven&#39;t put a case on my S4 note my note 4 and the note 7 while is made of glass front and back it feels too good to put a case on it. I&#39;ve hardly dropped my note 4 and when I have it&#39;s been from a low height onto carpet so I&#39;m hoping I can do as well with the note 7 and not damage it but it just feels and looks to good to cover it up I have no intentions of selling it either so not bothered if resale value is ruined. Will also admit S4 had some gimmicky features though I do sometimes miss that air gesture feature where you can wave your hand in front of the screen to go through photos in gallery lol. Certainly has matured now in the newer galaxies and touchwiz is much better than what it used to be looks pretty nice now and doesn&#39;t seem so laggy as it was. Did used to hate the touchwiz UI though lol now I quite like it. <br><br>I still think loads of people buy apple products for the brand name sure quite a few will buy it because it suits them better maybe they use a lot of apple products already or just use apps only found on iphones but still quite a lot of people especially teens and kids will buy iphone because it&#39;s seen as a high end phone to them quite honestly if I weren&#39;t so into tech I wouldn&#39;t know about half the android products available certainly wouldn&#39;t know about google Allo or even google now on tap and other google services and I wouldn&#39;t hardly know about devices either have only seen iphone and Samsung adverts here in the UK can&#39;t recall seeing an LG G5 ad or a LG v20 ad etc. <br><br>Yeah will admit apple do a good job at improving on tech that&#39;s already available and I don&#39;t have an issue with that, the issue is when they make it seem like they came up with it. Finger print scanners on android can also be used for other things than unlocking phone now like app purchases or login into paypal and the iris scanner on note 7 can be used for things too. <br><br>And that&#39;s what I do with my apps lol I don&#39;t like having all the apps on the homescreen cluttering it up which you can set it to add an icon to the home screen when you install apps but I keep that turned off and just leave all apps in the app drawer except 8 of my most used apps stay on the home screen I can even make it look and work near enough exactly like an iphone home screen if I want to and get the iphone lock screen if I want. I used the IR blaster on my note 4 too lol mainly to annoy people at pubs if they were watching the tv I&#39;d turn it off, landlord when and checked fuses XD or in stores and I&#39;d just turn of TV&#39;s. But I find I don&#39;t really use it at home so don&#39;t miss it though I still have my note 4 if I do need it and I forgot about the OTG feature of android I do mechanics on my motorcycle and have recently brought a endoscope inspection camera that plugs into a USB port on a computer but you can also plug it into an android phone and use an app to view the camera. <br><br>I have a normal note 4 not the edge version it seemed gimmicky to me at the time though now with both the edges being curved it&#39;s more of an aesthetic thing for me now, I do use the edge features on my note 7 has definitely become useful to have there and I have a note 5 rom on my note 4 so I get note 5 features on my note 4 including edge features and used it on there too. But yeah you can do same stuff on note 7 as you can on note 4 edge think it&#39;s got more features now unless the note 4 edge has been updated too but now you can have like a ruler, compass and flash light, you can have a panel with tasks to say quickly compose an SMS you can have apps there you can also have a facebook messenger panel tho this is a 3rd party panel and costs to download it.",2016-09-27T20:23:13Z,2016-09-27T20:23:13Z

,,,,,Renato Pascoal,"@***** ok so u kinda confirming my thoughts. Edge screen on note 4 have way more features than s6 edge gets, that I know. Not sure about note 5, coz it didn&#39;t come out in Europe. Note 7 though a lot of people have it already is yet to come out in stores. So I haven&#39;t checked note 7 yet. oh regarding that, I&#39;m in Europe too so we have this common thing of not having the  same  stuff for example US or other countries have, but on the other hand we have other common things like that LG G5 not hitting the stores or publicity. But I managed to get my hands on one with a spare battery, and that is the fastest charging method we can have. Just swap the battery. Something i used a lot coz I had that G5 mostly during vacations and I was taking a lot of pictures. And that&#39;s why I love it&#39;s dual camera set up. That super wide go pro like camera can take impossible pictures on a phone. So more useful than a dual set up that takes pure monochromatic pictures or one that does 2x optical zoom. <br><br>But back to that note 4 edge screen, it does the flashlight, ruler, timer, chronometer and stuff, you can use it for contacts shortcuts, you can add any app shortcuts you want, have sport results tickers, Weather widgets, etc etc. and it&#39;s only one edge. <br>As you know, fingerprint scanner on that phone pretty much serves only to unlock it but since it&#39;s a swipe down action and it doesn&#39;t get it right often, it&#39;s faster using the code feature or pattern unlock. Finger print features was something that was later integrated in android it self. And that came with the iPhone 5s in apples world. And another example updates are rare or almost inexistent. Once you buy a Samsung you can expect one major update, after that they totally forget about you and focus on newer devices. In my case I have that android update still pending but can&#39;t do it for whatever reason. It tells me all the time I have the update but when I try at some point during install process goes nuts and just reboots back to what i still have. Need to take same time and maybe restore to factory settings maybe then I can update. But it&#39;s a problem I never have on jos. <br><br>The gesture features and many others i had on my oppo. Like just drawing a circle on the screen while in sleep mode to activate camera or a V to activate flashlight. And u can add more. Like a M to activate music player, whatever u can think of. Those tap to wake and double tap on home to sleep. Double swipe up and down to control volume. 3 finger swipe for screenshot. It had many features like that I actually miss. Not considering the note 4, that oppo find 5 was the best android phone I had. In terms of customization u would love it. It even had a live wallpaper that would change according to the weather. Like the edges of the screen would fog and it snow would accumulate on the bottom icon shortcuts. And it is very well built. If u don&#39;t know oppo, being that u seem to love your tech you probably know MKBHD. Check is oppo find 5 video. <br><br>Cheers. It&#39;s really great to talk with someone who knows what his talking about and doesn&#39;t get lost on fan wars. Just expressing different opinions. ",2016-09-27T21:14:52Z,2016-09-27T21:14:52Z
,,,,,Michael,"+Renato Pascoal S6 has same features as note 4 edge think note 4 edge just has one columns of icons doesn&#39;t it but S6 I think unless it was on S7 got 2 columns of icons. But yeah has weather, sports tickers, facebook messenger, the tools, the contacts, news, calender events and music controls plus more can be downloaded. Finger print scanners on galaxy devices now use just a tap like on iphones but even my note 4 i could use finger print scanner to log into websites or paypal tho the website thing only works on Samsung internet which is a shame. And yeah updates suck on android unless you got a nexus phone or a stock android device though if you put custom roms on phones then you can get updates early I had android 6 way before the note 4 got updated here in the UK because I used a custom rom. Shame I have to do that to update early but one of those things most features of new updated can be added through apps anyway I&#39;ve found. But is one good thing about iphone is that you get updates as soon as they come out. <br><br>Don&#39;t think I&#39;d use the gesture things where you draw on the screen though can get that on any android there&#39;s an app for that :P I do like the sound of that weather wallpaper though but it hardly snows here in the UK if it does it doesn&#39;t last long so would never see the snowing effects lol If I had the cash I&#39;d love to get different android phones and see what features they have to offer as most phones have little features that are great but you won&#39;t know about unless you actually own one, wouldn&#39;t mind even getting an iphone 7 just to see what IOS is like now as I haven&#39;t used it since IOS 8 maybe 9 so would just like to see what&#39;s changed. I do like the S-pen though so couldn&#39;t be without it wouldn&#39;t even go back to the &quot;S&quot; range of galaxy phones. <br><br>Same here not often you come across people who understand the pros and cons of both sides of the IOS and android debate probably why I get annoyed at people because most Isheep just talk out of their backside and/or haven&#39;t owned a decent android phone they all have used some low end android phone that&#39;s crap and laggy and say &quot;android is shit it lags all the time&quot; it&#39;s like my getting an iphone 3GS and saying &quot;iphone is crap its really slow&quot;. Otherwise I realise some people just prefer using IOS and some prefer android non are better than the other like windows isn&#39;t better than mac and mac isn&#39;t better than windows just depends on what kinda use you need from it and if you don&#39;t care about customisation or anything like that then IOS is great for some people but I use NFC tags for things and I use OTG stuff so I need android plus I like to have control over devices hence why I jailbroke my iphone. I had my S4 and my note 4 rooted too but haven&#39;t rooted S7 edge that i have as I need to send it back when I get the newer note 7&#39;s but I don&#39;t miss root as I can still do most of the stuff without it lol.",2016-09-27T21:36:38Z,2016-09-27T21:36:38Z
,,,,,Renato Pascoal,"@***** well listen, out of the box, no apps no previous settings or tweaking, I remember at least the O and the V worked from the start. I later added other gestures. But imagine getting the phone out of your pocket, no need to press buttons no need to turn  on screen.  Just draw a random gesture on the screen while it&#39;s off (default or then customized by you) and you could bring camera on or flashlight or whatever. And then we  have to go back to when s3 was what Samsung had best. It was a very impressive phone. I bought the 32gb version (16 or 32), first 1080p phone with latest specs, killer specs for the time, for around £344 (converted now). They kept launching phones that always had something unique about them but I have no clue what they doing today. They have an European store and that&#39;s where I bought it from. Actually on the day they launched their European online store. U can&#39;t find them anywhere else. Then other brands with killer specs and half the money of the usual suspects, came along and many people started buying Xiaumi and One Plus and similar. Android is the best choice for people on a budget but still want a flagship phone that can compete with major brands. One plus gets the Gold coz in terms of performance it rules the android world for little money. CAnt beat an iPhone yet though LOL. ",2016-09-27T21:59:59Z,2016-09-27T21:59:59Z
,,,,,Michael,"+Renato Pascoal Ah right don&#39;t think 3rd party apps allow screen off gestures though they might do I can turn on my note 7 screen or I think even back to the S3 might has supported this but you can wave hand over screen to turn it on when it&#39;s lying on a table to see notifications but I do like the idea of that gesture thing you&#39;re on about. <br><br>And do you mean you don&#39;t know about what features are on new Samsung devices? One plus 3 is defo one of the best phones if you want good performance etc for a low price obviously wouldn&#39;t beat iphones lol but think the latest high end phones from Samsung, LG and HTC are near enough on par with iphones now. Certainly out do it in terms of features and all modern phones do basic things like facebook well it&#39;s when you get to the technical stuff that android has the edge on iphones take split screen multitasking for example or like you say the gestures on phones like the Oppo. I also love having complete manual control over the camera if I need it ever since the S6 came out I wanted the manual focus feature on my note 4 but there&#39;s no way to get it as it&#39;s somewhat down to hardware I think though don&#39;t see why it can&#39;t be added through software. Samsung by far make the best displays and camera&#39;s on any smart phone though the camera lacks in some areas admittedly but as an all round camera the S7 and note 7 are pretty much the best on the market at the moment and super amoled QHD screens on the new galaxy phones are gorgeous and if you don&#39;t like the vivid colours you can just turn them down in the settings.",2016-09-27T22:14:05Z,2016-09-27T22:14:05Z

,,,,,Radar Spoton,True. i know note 7 is good. But trust me it always lag after a year or so. Iphone the bulid from software to hardware is top notch. Though there is limitation to the customisation. That is why my iphone 5s is jailbroken and yet not lagging the whole system which i can choose what tweak i really need rather than samsung giving a ton of software which i never really use and worse is making the phone lag over a time. Iphone which is jailbroken will truly unleash the hidden potenital of an iphone. Trust me!,2016-09-27T11:02:28Z,2016-09-27T11:02:28Z

Note 5 looked good but didn&#39;t have micro SD card slot and while it and the S6 are better than the note 4 It didn&#39;t make me want one though I couldn&#39;t anyway as the note 5 was never launched here in the UK. Plus I stuck a note 5/s6 rom on my note 4 so I had things like screen off memo and the new air command lol but now note 7 is out and it&#39;s here in the UK I upgraded my contract early just to get it shame it had to explode though but can&#39;t wait for the new note 7&#39;s. <br><br>Note 7 is just all the things great about the note 4 except removable battery and IR blaster with all the good stuff on S6/S7 etc and the S-pen not to mention the design is amazing. Not sure why Samsung has removed the IR blaster makes more sense on the note 7 with the iris scanner possibly taking up space now but no reason on the S6-S7 or note 5.

And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some people had just simply used a cheap charger I do find it odd that the only Samsung phone with the issue is the note 7&#39;s with a new USB type C charging port. If people already have a cheap Type C cable or if they don&#39;t and they buy one and use it this could be a second factor sure the batteries are to blame but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a few non affected notes blew up due to dodgy chargers as well.,2016-09-28T09:15:29Z,2016-09-28T09:15:29Z

,,,,,Rev. Lauren Maddison,"Actually, people are not as ignorant as you seem to think, but you, however, have a tenuous grasp of tenses in the English language. In constructing an if-then hypothetical, you (inadvertently, no doubt) mixed tenses, which is incorrect. Example: If you&#39;d (or you HAD HAD) a dollar for every...you would HAVE HAD a few dollars. This puts both clauses in the past perfect tense.  Also, &quot;you&#39;d&quot; is not a compound word in any possible sense, though it is a contraction of either, which you did note as examples, so that&#39;s a point your favor, even if the rest of your diatribe is specious in the extreme. Really, though, the bottom line is that you have been unnecessarily rude to someone you don&#39;t even know for no reason.

Syed Hussain Fayaz,"Nice review but.... Upgrading from the S7 edge to the Note 7 has more benefits than just a S pen. <br><br>1. Touch ID has definately been improved<br>2. The Iris scanner is very useful for wet or gloved hands and its hell fast once it get used wth your eye. <br>3. The S pen of course <br>4. The display is definately brighter and the HDR is noticeable <br>5. I have the dual sim so a 64gig HD is very useful <br>6. It is a much better feel in the hand and its best looking mobile in a market. <br>7. The USB Type C and multiple benefits <br>8. The upgraded software and battery saving improvements are very useful <br>9. Change over now and you get a good resell value on your s7 edge <br>10. The larger screen is always appreciated even if its only minor. <br>11. Finger print scanner is cool.<br>In s7 edge you need to light up screen then you have to use finger print, but in Note 7 you just have to click the home key , finger print recognize right away !<br>And it&#39;s fast i love my note 7.<br><br>Thank you,  hope this helps.",2016-09-27T06:54:57Z,0,0,,,,
