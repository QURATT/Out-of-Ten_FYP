"so this is the hp envy 15 x 360. and"
"before i get into the review i want to"
"do a little sponsored"
"laptop deal segment by best buy they"
"want me to tell you about their best"
"laptop deals happening"
"right now and the first one is the"
"macbook air now this is only 50"
"off but the reason why i'm bringing it"
"up is because if you're looking for a"
"macbook"
"with an m1 the air is the best deal"
"don't waste your money on the pro don't"
"waste your money on the imac if you"
"don't have to"
"get the air because you're getting the"
"best bang for your buck and you're not"
"going to see that much of a performance"
"difference"
"the second one is even better the asus"
"q507 this was selling for 850"
"and right now you can pick it up for 750"
"bucks and this thing is stacked"
"r7 4700u processor by amd"
"256 gigabytes of ssd eight gigabytes of"
"ram and most importantly"
"an nvidia mx350 the next one is a"
"surface laptop three"
"the four is out on the market which"
"means the three is getting heavily"
"discounted"
"and you can pick up one for four hundred"
"dollars less"
"at best buy doesn't matter if it's the"
"ryzen or intel model"
"and finally if you're looking for a"
"convertible check out the hp pavilion"
"x360"
"this is a two in one it was selling for"
"800"
"and right now you can pick it up for 650"
"bucks"
"if you're interested in any of these"
"deals there'll be links to it in the"
"description"
"down below now the one thing that hp is"
"doing very well is making the envy"
"lineup the more affordable lineup look"
"very classy like this is a metal chassis"
"it looks clean"
"it has a black grayish look to it with"
"the hp logo in the middle"
"sure it doesn't have the crazy gem cut"
"design of the spectre"
"but it holds its own now this is a metal"
"chassis but it does feel a bit like"
"plastic and there's a little bit of flex"
"but it's not nearly as bad as the hp"
"omen 15. the other thing to note is that"
"this is a convertible so you can"
"completely flip this"
"display 360 degrees and use it as a"
"tablet"
"or purchase the pen and you can of"
"course draw on the display"
"i will say this though the hinge is kind"
"of stiff when you open it up a bit"
"but as soon as you get back to about i"
"don't know 90 degrees"
"it feels very loose like if you're"
"holding this up like this screen"
"is going to tilt backwards now the"
"weight on this thing is about 4.11"
"pounds so it's not the lightest 15 inch"
"ultrabook by any means but i still think"
"it's light enough that you'd be okay"
"carrying this"
"on a daily basis there's a lot of i o to"
"work with here"
"like on the left-hand side you have your"
"usb port"
"hdmi usb type-c if you want thunderbolt"
"you've got to go with the intel model"
"but because this is using ryzen"
"it's just a regular usb type-c port"
"audio jack and then"
"on the other side you have your barrel"
"connector for power"
"another usb port and a full-size sd card"
"slot"
"now probably not a big deal for a lot of"
"people but you can't open up this laptop"
"with one hand you have to use one hand"
"to hold the deck down"
"hey nice deck dude thanks dirk it's real"
"cedar"
"and because this deck is so big some of"
"you might say why didn't they put"
"a numpad and look you have two options"
"you either put a numpad on this"
"and then put the speakers on the bottom"
"or you go with upward"
"firing speakers me personally i'd rather"
"have the upward firing speakers"
"now the typing experience is okay i find"
"the keys to be a bit too mushy compared"
"to the spectre"
"but it's fine if you're typing on them"
"for a long period of time there's a"
"fingerprint scanner"
"right beside the alt key if you want to"
"use windows hello to log you in"
"and the touchpad it's centered and it's"
"19 bigger"
"compared to the previous year now the"
"touch pad doesn't have the same"
"finesse as a true glass touch pad it's"
"fine"
"but it's nothing compared to let's say"
"the touchpad on the surface laptop"
"now when you open up this display"
"there's a bit of wobble so like if"
"you're typing on this very aggressively"
"the screen will shake"
"a little bit and the display is okay"
"like there's two versions of this"
"there's a cheaper one"
"that's only 250 nits but if you spend 80"
"dollars more"
"you get this one here it's 16x9 and i"
"feel like this would have been a good"
"opportunity for hp to incorporate"
"a 16 by 10 display instead but"
"it's not a bad panel like it gets close"
"to 400 nits of brightness the color"
"gamut's good"
"and i feel a lot of people spending the"
"extra money on the more expensive one"
"will have a good display for design work"
"now since the speakers are on the top of"
"the deck if you're curious how it sounds"
"i'm compared to the surface laptop 4"
"and you guys let me know which one"
"sounds better"
"[Music]"
"now the price on this is a thousand and"
"thirty nine dollars at least the review"
"unit that i have here but i think it's"
"pretty fair considering it's packing the"
"latest"
"ryzen 5000 cpu with 16 gigabytes of ram"
"and a 512 gigabyte nvme"
"ssd like if you're doing anything"
"multi-core related"
"this thing absolutely screams like if"
"you're some sort of developer"
"and you're compiling code then this"
"thing is going to be absolutely awesome"
"to use"
"the one area that it kind of does suffer"
"in is when you're doing anything in the"
"adobe suite"
"like intel processors paired with their"
"iris xe"
"still give you better results but most"
"cpu related tasks has an advantage on"
"these amd"
"processors now when it comes to heat"
"management it does pretty good"
"like i tested this out on balanced and"
"performance mode when you're using"
"balanced mode"
"it keeps the cpu temps under 80 degrees"
"celsius but you get a nerf in clock"
"speeds the advantage to this is you get"
"a very quiet"
"laptop under 40 decibels or around 40"
"decibels of noise"
"when you kick it onto performance mode"
"it gets a little hot it goes up to 90"
"degrees but it doesn't do this for a"
"very long period of time"
"the fans will be louder it will slightly"
"go over 40 decibels but you're able to"
"push this thing"
"a bit more yes i think hp could have"
"been more aggressive with the tuning"
"but most people are just using this for"
"every day and i think"
"they value fan noise a little bit more"
"than having the maximum performance"
"now thankfully a lot of the regular"
"stuff you'd expect"
"is upgradable like there's one slot for"
"an nvme ssd"
"and you can swap this out for something"
"bigger the other thing is the ram"
"this is not soldered onto the"
"motherboard so if you want to put more"
"ram in here down the road"
"you have the option to do so and i"
"always love seeing"
"two fans on an ultrabook i know a lot of"
"companies"
"tend to use only one but even with just"
"an integrated gpu like this one"
"two fans do a better job of keeping this"
"thing cool you have your swappable wi-fi"
"six card"
"and then you have a 51 watt hour battery"
"which gets me about 11 hours and 44"
"minutes of use"
"before needing to charge so here's the"
"thing the hp envy 15"
"x 360 is obviously not perfect but i"
"don't have a ton of complaints"
"yes i do wish the screen was 16 by 10. i"
"do wish the keyboard was more tactile"
"and obviously the hinges should be a bit"
"tighter"
"but for the price for an envy being"
"aimed towards budget to more"
"mid-range users i think they nailed the"
"most important things"
"fantastic performance great battery life"
"and low fan noise like when you're"
"running this under full load"
"it's not going to bother you or the"
"people surrounding you"
"so yeah if you're interested in checking"
"this out or have any more questions let"
"me know in the comment section down"
"below"
"also if you're interested in any of"
"those best buy deals there'll be links"
"in the description"
"if you want to check them out like the"
"video if you liked it subscribe if you"
"haven't already and i'll see you guys"
"in the next one"
"[Music]"
"what's up youtube"
"how goes it so you may remember several"
"weeks ago i actually did a review on"
"hp's mid-range hp laptop 15 and that"
"review kind of left a bitter taste in my"
"mouth when it comes to hp"
"products that laptop was not good at all"
"for various reasons"
"if you are interested in checking a"
"review out i'll leave a link in the"
"description below"
"for your own reference however with that"
"being said i figured i'd give hp another"
"chance but this time in their higher end"
"premium market so for today"
"we're actually reviewing the hp envy"
"x360 two in one 15-inch laptop"
"this bad boy has been refreshed with the"
"latest tiger lake processor"
"it's got a lot to offer and we're going"
"to see in this review"
"if it lives up to its hype and"
"expectations or if it's going to be"
"another disappointment by hp"
"whatever the case we're definitely going"
"to try to answer the question if it's"
"worth it for"
"you guys so as always guys if you enjoy"
"the content"
"hit that like button consider"
"subscribing to my channel we got all"
"kinds of awesome quality content here"
"thank you so much for watching without"
"further ado let's get started starting"
"off with a super quick"
"unboxing so the very first thing you're"
"going to notice of course"
"is that there's a very nice sleek modern"
"black cardboard box here"
"with the hp envy graphics i'm glad to"
"see hp put priority around premium"
"packaging"
"once you remove the content seal itself"
"and proceed to actually open the box"
"you're going to find a number of items"
"first and foremost of course"
"our laptop tightly wrapped in plastic"
"wrapping"
"once you remove the wrapping itself"
"inside here it is in a nice"
"metallic silver color looks pretty sleek"
"to be honest but we'll come back to the"
"laptop in just a second"
"beyond that you're going to find you"
"have another white box inside this white"
"box the first thing you have is a 65"
"watt charging adapter unfortunately it's"
"proprietary honestly it's becoming"
"shameful how a"
"high-end laptop is using a cheap"
"proprietary charging adapter as opposed"
"to a usbc adapter"
"they could really learn a thing or two"
"from the dell xps 13 or the new macbooks"
"of course with that being said you do"
"also get a wall outlet cable for the"
"adapter"
"and inside you have a smaller black box"
"inside this stylish black box you have"
"the hp stylus i can't remember the exact"
"name for it"
"i'll put in the description however and"
"it looks pretty nice"
"it's also matching with the color it's"
"made of hard tpu we'll come back to this"
"in a second as well"
"and that's pretty much all the important"
"things inside the box"
"next let's talk about the design of this"
"laptop so this is a pretty heavy laptop"
"weighing just"
"over 4.2 pounds keep in mind of course"
"firstly this is a 15 inch laptop"
"and secondly this is technically a two"
"in one and not a ultra book"
"of course with that being said hp has"
"used a nice mix of standard and premium"
"materials"
"and this laptop definitely looks premium"
"and it feels premium as well for the"
"most part"
"starting off at the top side of the"
"laptop you have this nice smooth"
"metallic finish"
"there's no particular texture which i"
"kind of like it seems to be a growing"
"trend with premium laptops"
"any dead center you have this super"
"stylish hp"
"logo it looks more modern more sleek i'm"
"digging it"
"and that's pretty much it for the top"
"side on the rear side of the laptop you"
"can tell this is a pretty thick laptop"
"from a height perspective"
"you also notice you have the hp envy"
"branding on one of the hinges"
"and in the center area is where you have"
"your outtake vent this is where all the"
"hot air basically comes out of from the"
"laptop"
"as you make your way to the side of the"
"laptop io port diversity is definitely"
"less than ideal"
"so on one side you have a headphone jack"
"a"
"usb a port you also have a hdmi port"
"and yes you do have a usbc port with"
"power transmission capabilities"
"on the other side you have that hideous"
"proprietary charging jack and of course"
"you also have"
"another usb 3.0 port and lastly you do"
"have a full-sized"
"sd card reader which is a nice touch"
"finally as we get to the bottom of the"
"laptop"
"i again have to appreciate hp's"
"consistency in terms of quality here"
"the bottom of the laptop actually also"
"has a metallic finish"
"you have this nice large vent this is of"
"course for air intake and if you look"
"carefully you'll notice on either side"
"of the laptop"
"you have a speaker grille this of course"
"is for the bang"
"olufsen stereo speaker setup we will by"
"the way do a sound test later on in the"
"video"
"so make sure you stay tuned for that as"
"you unfold the laptop"
"you'll notice a few things first and"
"foremost you have this nice metallic"
"finish here as well which is the same"
"color as the rest of the body"
"also you'll notice that you have a"
"reasonable amount of camera space"
"while it's not the most i've seen on a"
"15-inch laptop it is well within the"
"acceptability threshold"
"also you'll notice you have a pretty"
"large track pad that actually looks"
"really sleek and modern"
"with a glass surface unfortunately the"
"minute you actually start clicking on"
"this trackpad"
"it's less than ideal quality the clicks"
"are flimsy"
"the trackpad tends to off-balance a"
"little bit if you click on one corner or"
"the other"
"so why i wouldn't say it's terrible it"
"doesn't meet"
"the looks it portrays so you know"
"there's a little quality gap here"
"next up we make our way to the keyboard"
"and i have to be honest the keyboard"
"here is pretty decent in quality"
"so it's not flimsy or loose in the"
"slightest the keys look like they're"
"well made"
"and definitely match with the rest of"
"the laptop unfortunately i find there's"
"a less than ideal key travel i would"
"appreciate a little bit more key travel"
"which would end result give me a more"
"tactile feel but some people might"
"actually appreciate the more soft touch"
"nature of this keyboard it's gonna come"
"down to preference"
"you also have the inclusion of a full"
"size 10 key number pad"
"and yes the keyboard is fully backlit"
"the backlighting is pretty strong"
"also you do not have any dedicated media"
"keys"
"they are all integrated into the"
"traditional function keyset"
"so there's that you also have the power"
"button which is kind of meshing with the"
"rest of the keyboard i personally like"
"having dedicated power buttons"
"but again that's more of an aesthetics"
"preference also near the aero case at"
"the bottom of the keyboard"
"you'll notice you have a dedicated"
"fingerprint sensor"
"so awkwardly placed however it looks"
"pretty sleek past the keyboard itself"
"you'll notice you have this nice"
"large mesh grille this is not a speaker"
"grille"
"those are located on either corner of"
"the laptop towards the bottom side"
"this is actually a passive cooling vent"
"and more of a design"
"choice also directly above that you'll"
"notice you have a two tier"
"hinge system so you have one inch on"
"either side and this is a really well"
"built hinge"
"i found for the most part it's super"
"sturdy it doesn't wobble too much"
"and it has to be sturdy because this"
"laptop can technically rotate 360"
"degrees"
"and turn into a hybrid tablet so of"
"course that quality is expected"
"as you make your way to the actual"
"display fitting you'll notice you have"
"super thin bezels that are more or less"
"in line with 2021 standards"
"a relatively thin chin on the top side"
"you have"
"another laptop with another mediocre"
"720p webcam"
"thankfully it's not any worse than the"
"competition but unfortunately it's not"
"any better either"
"if you're using it in low light"
"condition lord have mercy on you let's"
"talk about the display quality"
"i don't know what it is with a lot of"
"these premium laptop makers"
"but when it comes to making laptops for"
"creative users"
"it's like they don't know who their"
"target audience even is so"
"the display quality here isn't"
"inherently bad it's just not good"
"considering this is a premium laptop"
"so you have a full hd 1080p screen which"
"in itself is not bad the resolution is"
"clear and sharp enough"
"where things start getting very"
"depressing very quickly is when you come"
"to the color accuracy"
"so you only have a 45 ntsc screen"
"in other words you only have a 67 s rgb"
"rating"
"so colors don't look washed out but they"
"don't look vivid either and if you are a"
"power creative user doing a lot of photo"
"editing color grading or video editing"
"you're definitely going to notice those"
"lackluster colors also"
"you only have a peak brightness of 250"
"nits"
"this is a hybrid laptop versatile laptop"
"whatever you want to call it"
"the fact is that 250 nits is not even"
"closely sufficient for an"
"outdoor setting where the sun is at your"
"screen it's gonna feel washed out this"
"is only sufficient for indoor settings"
"i don't know what they were thinking"
"when they made this display in terms of"
"brightness and color accuracy"
"but this is definitely one of the most"
"disappointing elements of this laptop"
"next up let's talk about performance so"
"from a specifications perspective this"
"particular configuration is rocking"
"intel's latest 11th generation"
"core f5 1135 g7 processor"
"we've also got 8 gigabytes of ddr4 ram"
"clocked at 3 200 megahertz"
"of course we also have a one terabyte"
"salsa drive"
"and lastly yes we do have intel iris xc"
"graphics"
"with a total of 4gb shared memory it's"
"also worth noting you do have the latest"
"wi-fi 6 and bluetooth standard on board"
"so day-to-day performance is going to"
"feel as snappy as it should with any"
"modern day laptop"
"documents open up super fast web"
"browsers are responsive and of course"
"you can watch any"
"of your favorite netflix or youtube"
"videos without any sort of lag"
"in short of you having a crappy internet"
"connection so"
"that's going to feel pretty normal where"
"things of course get interesting is when"
"you start doing more"
"resource intensive tasks let's say video"
"editing for example"
"i was pretty impressed with this laptop"
"it keeps it's cool when you're doing"
"1080p video editing on adobe rush"
"there's no frame drop whatsoever it's a"
"very smooth experience"
"even when you start doing more intensive"
"4k video editing"
"you'll still find relatively for the"
"most part there's little to no frame"
"drop"
"it's only when you're doing it for"
"prolonged periods of time you start"
"noticing the occasional performance drop"
"but beyond that it's pretty well done"
"from a gaming perspective"
"this laptop is about what you'd expect"
"so the intel iris xc chip can only"
"produce"
"so much power because it's an integrated"
"gpu not a dedicated one"
"which basically means you can run most"
"aaa titles but don't expect them to run"
"beyond 30 fps"
"at low settings if you're gonna use the"
"native resolution also"
"some games may actually go beyond that"
"but again it'll depend on the game"
"you're playing and how well it's"
"optimized"
"and i know there's a subset of you who"
"want to know the temperatures on this"
"thing"
"so if you're gonna use this thing like a"
"wild horse under peak stress you can"
"expect a"
"maximum surface temperature of 47"
"degrees celsius"
"however under more realistic and"
"moderate usage conditions"
"the surface temperature hovers around 35"
"to 37 degrees celsius"
"and if you are using a low workload or"
"if you're keeping it in idle conditions"
"then the temperature actually stays"
"below 23 degrees celsius which is pretty"
"comfortable"
"so while the temperatures aren't absurd"
"yes this laptop can get pretty hot"
"pretty quickly"
"if you start doing exotic things for"
"prolonged periods"
"from a battery life perspective this"
"laptop isn't that impressive"
"so basically if you are doing day-to-day"
"tasks with a moderate workload at 50"
"brightness you can get up to 8.5"
"hours of battery life however we found"
"that if you increase the brightness to"
"100"
"with a moderate workload that quickly"
"drops to around 5.5 hours"
"and if you start doing more cpu"
"intensive stuff and you have a heavy"
"workload non-stop"
"the battery life can drop to as little"
"as 1.5"
"hours so it's a pretty dramatic drop so"
"keep in mind if you're buying this"
"laptop for all day usage"
"this might not be the best option in"
"that regards from a sound perspective"
"this laptop sounds pretty good to be"
"honest"
"the bang and often stereo setup is"
"actually better than i thought it would"
"be"
"but have a quick listen for yourself you"
"be the judge"
"[Music]"
"[Applause]"
"[Music]"
"the final element i want to talk about"
"is the touchscreen and the hp stylus"
"given the fact this is a convertible"
"twin one laptop"
"we have to keep in mind that it is also"
"intended to be used as a tablet"
"with that being said the stylus hd"
"provides is pretty high in quality it's"
"actually charged through"
"a usb-c port which is ironic because hp"
"uses a proprietary charging port"
"for their laptop take notes from your"
"own products hp seriously"
"of course with that being said i have to"
"say that it's super responsive"
"there's practically no lag or latency"
"between what you're writing and what's"
"appearing on the screen itself"
"and yes you can use the touchscreen with"
"your fingers as well generally speaking"
"i think this is"
"a great hybrid tablet even though the"
"display quality is not that good"
"the responsiveness of the touchscreen is"
"on the contrary quite"
"amazing so what's my final take on this"
"laptop well priced at 1050 usd"
"this is a two-in-one laptop that's"
"competing in the premium market"
"and in terms of the feel and design of"
"this laptop it's top notch the build"
"quality is definitely there"
"and i really like how hp is trying their"
"best to make a premium experience over"
"here"
"also the fantastic keyboard is a welcome"
"addition"
"i also appreciate the high quality sound"
"system from bangin olsen here"
"it definitely sounds a notch above your"
"average laptop"
"unfortunately the less than ideal"
"borderline disappointing display"
"is not good for many people if you are a"
"creative user"
"you may be entirely driven away from"
"that less than ideal color accuracy"
"again"
"also the battery life is not that good"
"in itself eight hours of average usage"
"time at 50 brightness"
"is nothing to write home about so if you"
"are looking for all-day usage here this"
"laptop"
"is not the ideal choice also it's worth"
"noting it would have been nice if"
"hp included more i o port diversity"
"while it's not the worst i've seen on"
"laptops in this class this is a 15-inch"
"laptop"
"there was definitely space to add an"
"additional port or two"
"overall this laptop isn't a bad value"
"it's just that it's going to be very"
"specific for the type of audience it's"
"targeted at"
"which is ironic because a lot of"
"creative users might eye it for its"
"hybrid tablet"
"capabilities but that display quality"
"may at the same time turn them away"
"so use it at your own discretion try it"
"out see if it's the right one for you"
"but overall my take is if you are"
"someone who relies heavily on color"
"accuracy"
"don't go for this laptop but if you are"
"someone looking for versatility"
"and you want a nice hybrid tablet that's"
"good in build quality and justifies the"
"premium price"
"this is definitely a laptop for you as"
"always guys"
"if you enjoyed this review consider"
"subscribing to my channel i got all"
"sorts of awesome tech content thank you"
"so much for watching this video"
"i'll catch you in the next one soul tech"
"logging out"
"historically speaking hp envy's x360"
"series has kind of been like glaze's"
"plain salted flavor so it doesn't have a"
"ton of punch to it but yet everyone"
"loves it and this is one of the most"
"popular two-in-one laptops on the market"
"now of course today we have the latest"
"iteration the 2022 version of the hp"
"envy x360 laptop and as you might have"
"guessed it's rocking the list intel"
"internals for example we have in this"
"particular base configuration the i5"
"1240p processor eight gigabytes of ddr4"
"memory in a dual channel configuration"
"we have the latest generation of intel"
"iris xc integrated graphics a 512"
"gigabyte software drive we also have a"
"wi-fi 60 and bluetooth 5.2 standards on"
"board and finally this is a 15-inch"
"fully touch captive display now as"
"always there's a lot to talk about with"
"this laptop it's a fully loaded review"
"so let me know what you think at the end"
"of the video thanks for watching let's"
"get started now i would love to show you"
"what the face of this actual package"
"looks like but the shipping company"
"massacred it with stickers all over the"
"place and i just don't have the patience"
"to use google to remove all of them but"
"in any case it's a nice looking box once"
"you remove the content seals and open"
"the box up inside you'll find a few"
"items first and foremost the laptop"
"itself loaded with a ton of harmful"
"protective plastic packaging but anyway"
"once you remove all of that here we have"
"the hp envy x360 looks somewhat similar"
"to last year but still very modern and"
"sleek now past that you have a standard"
"65 watt charging adapter unfortunately"
"you still have a charging pin as opposed"
"to a usb-c pin my heart is a little"
"broken not gonna lie now past that you"
"do have another standard wall outlet"
"charging cable piece which of course is"
"required to power the adapter and past"
"that you do get in the box the hp mpp"
"2.0 stylus and once you open this thing"
"i'm a huge fan of the stylus it's really"
"lightweight it's elegant yet practical"
"it comes with two tips and it has usbc"
"charging which is great of course and"
"finally you have this paper envelope"
"here inside you will find the quick"
"start guide warranty and regulation"
"information if you're expecting a lot of"
"design changes well you're not going to"
"get those here the hp envy x360 still"
"looks very similar to last year's model"
"you still have those sharp linear edges"
"a high quality metallic exterior finish"
"and of course those wide dimensions now"
"it's not necessarily a bad thing it's"
"still a very modern design but again"
"it's not going gonna look very distinct"
"from 2021 models with that said this"
"laptop does have a overall weight of"
"about four pounds making it one of the"
"more heavier 15-inch productivity"
"laptops in the market now of course the"
"good news over here is that starting"
"with the top side like i mentioned you"
"have a high quality metallic finish it's"
"smooth it's textureless it just feels"
"really nice and one of my favorite parts"
"is that really subtle hp branding they"
"have in the center it just looks really"
"premium and i'm a big fan of it the size"
"of the laptop is where you'll find all"
"the i o ports so on one side you have a"
"usb a super speed port with reverse"
"charging functionality you also have a"
"modern hdmi 2.1 port a speedy"
"thunderbolt 4 port that has power"
"delivery and displayport functionality"
"you also of course have a good old"
"headphone jack now on the other side you"
"will find one more usb-a super speed"
"port you also of course have the dc jack"
"to plug the actual laptop and finally"
"you have a dedicated full-size sd card"
"reader while the standards could have"
"included at least one more thunderbolt 4"
"port overall io port diversity is pretty"
"decent on this machine the bottom side"
"of the laptop has changed a little bit"
"so you still have that high quality"
"metallic finish but you will notice you"
"have a considerably wider air intake"
"vent over here which is always good news"
"for the most part because that means"
"it'll ultimately be a cooler laptop you"
"will notice hp also got rid of the fancy"
"nv style design speaker grilles and"
"replace them with more well standard"
"looking ones i guess that's not a bad"
"thing in terms of performance i did like"
"the old design better and yes of course"
"this is a stereo speaker setup sound"
"test to follow later on in the video as"
"soon as you unfold this laptop you"
"appreciate the amount of palm rest space"
"you have but that is expected with a"
"large 15-inch laptop like this what you"
"will appreciate also is the massive"
"track pad you have here you have a lot"
"of surf real estate space and it's"
"appropriately put in a laptop of this"
"class unfortunately quality isn't all"
"that good for example you have a plastic"
"surface finish this is a premium laptop"
"it should have a glass surface trackpad"
"on top of that while the clicks are"
"tactile there is a moderate amount of"
"flex on either the right or left bottom"
"corners and the calibration isn't all"
"that good either generally speaking i"
"was expecting a considerably better"
"crack pad given this is technically a"
"premium laptop on a lighter note the"
"keyboard is pretty good so you'll notice"
"you have large keycaps with plenty of"
"surface area it's well labeled it's"
"fully backlit and the overall quality of"
"the typing experience is also very nice"
"you have tactile keystrokes and you also"
"have plenty of key travel but you also"
"appreciate the fact that it's not a very"
"loud keyboard it's great for a"
"productive or office environment now you"
"do have a built-in fingerprint scanner"
"right next to the arrow keys one thing i"
"absolutely despise about this keyboard"
"is the lack of a 10 keypad which could"
"have been easily accommodated if hp"
"would finally get rid of these pseudo"
"grilles they don't cool the laptop nor"
"are these speakers in fact they don't"
"really serve any major purpose and"
"getting rid of them would just allow you"
"to fit more practical things like a 10"
"keypad again so definitely knocking off"
"a full star for that the hinge quality"
"on this laptop is in fact top notch"
"which is a requirement for any good"
"convertible laptop it doesn't have a lot"
"of wobble it's sturdy it has the right"
"amount of calibration to keep it tight"
"but not so tight that it might be a"
"problem in the long term overall it"
"should do great in the years to come now"
"display fitting you have a screen to"
"body ratio of about 88"
"which isn't bad and you'll notice you do"
"have somewhat of a thick chin at the"
"bottom but the bezels in contrast are"
"relatively narrow you also have a pretty"
"thin forehead at the top what is quite"
"shameful of course is that miserable"
"720p webcam you can toss your dreams of"
"looking good on this laptop right out"
"the window because honestly it's just"
"weird how they're still okay with"
"putting a"
"non-full hd webcam in 2022 on a premium"
"laptop the display oh the display so"
"think of it this way imagine having a"
"really modern sleek looking car but when"
"you sit inside the dashboard looks like"
"it's straight from the 1980s that's"
"right that's how i feel about this"
"display so starting off with the"
"somewhat good stuff you do have a"
"standard full hd or 1080p resolution a"
"60 hertz refresh rate a 16 9 aspect"
"ratio a high quality ips panel that"
"actually has amazing viewing angles and"
"no pwm flickering detected it doesn't"
"sound so bad until now additionally you"
"also have a multi-touch 10-point system"
"and i gotta tell you the mpp 2.0 stylus"
"is actually amazing it practically has"
"no lag or latency it's great to type"
"with the tip is of high quality and it"
"just feels like a very smooth experience"
"overall but here's where things start"
"getting really bad really fast you have"
"a 45 ntsc color rating or approximately"
"56 percent srgb colors look poor washed"
"out and anyone who needs high degree of"
"color accuracy will not be happy with"
"this display but the real crime here is"
"that you have a display that attracts so"
"much glitter because of its reflective"
"surface and you only have 250 nits to"
"compensate for that basically you cannot"
"use this thing in any bright daylight"
"setting whatsoever period it's just"
"shameful how there's laptops that cost"
"500 less than this display and they have"
"a better color and often a better"
"brightness rating than this laptop it's"
"just not acceptable for a premium laptop"
"now there is a saving grace to this"
"laptop and that's its general"
"performance so you can get this in"
"either a i5 or i7 12th gen configuration"
"and depending which one you get you get"
"8 or 16 gigabytes of ram respectively"
"for the base configuration here"
"day-to-day tasks like web browsing"
"watching videos typing up documents work"
"in a very smooth and predictable way"
"even more demanding activities like"
"photo editing or video editing are very"
"much doable even with the base"
"configuration now it is worth noting if"
"you are doing something as intense as 4k"
"video editing you definitely want to opt"
"for the 16 gigabyte configuration"
"because that 8gb very quickly becomes a"
"bottleneck and you will notice"
"occasional frame drops and just laggy"
"performance in general but again that's"
"more of a ram problem now as far as"
"gaming goes i was pleasantly surprised"
"because you can play modern games like"
"fortnite for example at medium settings"
"ranging somewhere between 30 to 60"
"frames per second and it's a passable"
"experience for casual gaming i'm a"
"pretty big fan of thermals on this"
"laptop so for example with this device"
"under unrealistic peak loads you can hit"
"a maximum surface temperature of"
"approximately 43 degrees celsius but"
"more realistic heavy loads will yield"
"you around 38 degrees celsius which is a"
"very manageable and reasonable number"
"fan noise is also pretty good for"
"example doing heavy loads will yield"
"you're around 40 decibels of noise level"
"if you really push the fan to its limit"
"it can go up to 43 decibels but this is"
"usually for brief periods of time and if"
"you're doing anything less than that the"
"fans hardly go on so generally speaking"
"great thermals as far as battery life is"
"concerned you can get approximately nine"
"hours of real-world usage non-benchmark"
"of course which basically means"
"activities like web browsing watching"
"youtube or netflix at about 1080p doing"
"light photo editing and even"
"occasionally using the speakers at"
"approximately forty percent volume and"
"all of this at fifty percent screen"
"brightness of course now another thing"
"worth noting is the speaker quality on"
"this laptop is decent but not great"
"given it's a bang and awesome stereo"
"speaker setup doesn't get as loud as i"
"thought it would but still it's a decent"
"experience have a quick listen for"
"yourself"
"[Music]"
"[Applause]"
"[Music]"
"with the 1100 starting price the hp envy"
"x360 definitely treads well into premium"
"laptop territory and at that price it"
"does give a lot but it also doesn't give"
"a lot at the exact same time so let's"
"look at the good stuff for example you"
"get top notch build quality with a high"
"quality metallic exterior finish you"
"also have a great keyboard coupled with"
"a high quality hinge a great two-in-one"
"function that's built into laptop you"
"also get hp's mpp 2.0 stylus right out"
"of the box and it's a high quality"
"stylus at that additionally you have"
"great performance with this laptop and"
"generally speaking thermals are quite"
"respectable now on the flip side hp just"
"does these little things that really"
"make you question if this is a premium"
"laptop like that low quality display a"
"45 ntsc rating is just unacceptable on a"
"laptop of this price and tier in general"
"also i don't appreciate the fact for"
"example that you have a standard hd"
"webcam or the fact that they've wasted"
"so much keyboard layout space and they"
"don't include a practical 10 keypad"
"those things definitely are factors of"
"consideration for a lot of people but if"
"you're willing to forgive those or"
"overgo those then this is still overall"
"a decent laptop in the premium category"
"overall let me know what you think of"
"this laptop i'd love to hear your"
"thoughts and make sure you subscribe and"
"hit that like button it genuinely helps"
"me a lot thanks for watching see in the"
"next one"
"Even with the knowledge of how good"
"the Zen 2 was on the desktop,"
"I was shocked at how well AMD's Ryzen 4000 series"
"mobile series performed."
"Asus' Zephyrus G14 shredded its Intel competitors"
"in both performance and battery life,"
"while also being considerably cheaper."
"Now it looks like HP hopes to recreate that success"
"with the Envy x360."
"And, spoiler alert,"
"they did."
"This thing sips power, yet it has six cores"
"and is $800 for a configuration"
"that we can actually recommend."
"What?"
"You know? Like, what?"
"Like, what's a segue?"
"GlassWire lets you keep track of the weird stuff"
"that's connecting to your PC,"
"even when you aren't using it."
"You can see if a strange device joins your Wi-Fi,"
"and block it instantly."
"Get 25% off by using code LINUS at the link below."
"(upbeat music)"
"Our config of the HP Envy x360 sports a Ryzen 5 4500U,"
"a 7-nanometer, 6-core, 6-thread processor"
"that boosts up to 4 gigahertz."
"The last 6-core Ultrabook we looked at"
"was the Dell XPS 13, a beast of a machine,"
"except that it costs a casual 1,800 U.S. dollars,"
"which is why we will not be comparing the Envy x360 to it."
"Instead, we'll be testing it against the HP Spectre x360"
"with an Intel Core i5-1035G4,"
"a 4-core, 8-thread CPU on Intel's newish 10-nanometer node"
"that you would hope would give the Ryzen 5"
"a run for its money, especially since it's in a machine"
"that costs (clears throat) $250 more."
"But that maximum boost speed of 3.7 gigahertz"
"isn't a good first sign."
"A much worse sign is the performance tests we ran."
"In multicore loads, the Ryzen 5 4500U"
"is set to shred the i5 with a 45% higher score in Cinebench."
"Like, I knew it was gonna win, just not by that much."
"And remember, guys, this isn't even"
"the top-spec 8-core model."
"Even more surprisingly, though, the 4500U"
"managed to dominate the single-threaded test as well,"
"thanks to that higher boost clock."
"Now, although I don't expect anyone"
"to be doing much hardcore gaming"
"on either of these machines, the Ryzen 5 4500U"
"was also 20% faster in 3DMark Time Spy,"
"and I'm never gonna complain about a bit more GPU muscle."
"Thermals, unfortunately,"
"didn't redeem the Core i5 version either."
"It immediately shot up to 100 degrees and stayed there,"
"managing clocks of only around 2.3 gigahertz,"
"something we might have accepted"
"if Intel was the only option in town because,"
"I mean, in fairness, that is at least faster"
"than the 1.5-gigahertz base clock."
"Thing is, Intel isn't the only option anymore,"
"and our Ryzen 5 config avoided thermal throttling,"
"albeit barely, at 91 degrees,"
"while keeping all six of its cores"
"at a whopping 3.3 gigahertz."
"Look how thin it is, guys! 3.3 gigahertz!"
"It's worth noting that you'll have to"
"enable performance mode to get these kind of speeds,"
"but they're truly remarkable."
"Remember that Dell XPS 13 with a 6-core i7"
"that I mentioned at the start of this video?"
"Yeah."
"In performance mode, this Ryzen machine"
"is faster than that too."
"The thing is, performance matters a lot less"
"than longevity in a thin-and-light"
"than it does in a gaming laptop,"
"and HP already has some of the best"
"battery life in the biz with their Intel Core i5 model,"
"managing nearly 13 hours on a single charge."
"That is gonna be hard to..."
"And the AMD Envy x360 made it almost 14 hours."
"That's the kinda battery life that not only"
"gets you through the day, but maybe even the weekend."
"Like, you could just leave the power brick at work,"
"without worrying that your lttstore.com browsing session"
"is gonna get cut short."
"- This is my whole weekend."
"- But that raises the question: Is this the kinda machine"
"that you'd wanna take home with you anyway?"
"One of AMD's big problems, for years now,"
"has been not getting their CPUs into the premium designs,"
"and this is no exception."
"The Envy line does sit below"
"the Spectre line in HP's lineups."
"So has HP given their Envy x360 enough love?"
"Or should you just save up a bit longer"
"for a Spectre x360 or an XPS 13?"
"Actually, I am pleased to report"
"that HP has committed no such crime against AMD here."
"The Envy x360 has a premium look about it,"
"from the super small bezels"
"to the metallic accents on the hinges."
"The chassis stiffness might not quite hold up"
"to top-tier laptops that are constructed out of carbon fiber"
"or a solid milled piece of aluminum,"
"but it's leagues better than a budget-focused machine"
"like Lenovo Flex 14."
"So I think it's fair to say that HP"
"really nailed the balance here."
"The only thing build quality-wise that annoyed me"
"was the screen, which wobbles a bit more than I'd like."
"But bearing in mind that, of course,"
"I've got that tablet-convertible trade-off, I can accept it."
"And the I/O is really good."
"The Envy x360 has two USB Type-A's"
"with the little hingey pull-down bit."
"Oh, it turns out you can put a Type-A in a superthin laptop."
"How nice!"
"It's got a Type C with charging,"
"and it's got an SD card reader."
"I do wish that, instead of the barrel power connector"
"on the right side, we got another USB Type-C port"
"with charging, but presumably,"
"that would've brought up the price,"
"and I think they found a great balance here."
"One place HP fortunately didn't cheap out is the display."
"With 300 nits of brightness and excellent colors,"
"I think anyone short of a professional photo editor"
"is gonna be pretty happy with it."
"My only complaint here is the 16x9 aspect ratio."
"These days, many of HP's competitors"
"are making the jump to 16x10 or even 3x2,"
"and this is even in the lower price ranges,"
"with the Acer Swift 3 leading the way."
"Get subscribed, by the way, so you don't miss our video"
"on that little number."
"Staying with 16x9 while chasing small bezels"
"has to be HP's most obvious error"
"with both the Envy and Spectre x360s,"
"because it means that some folks"
"are actually gonna struggle to use the devices comfortably."
"- There's just no way for me to type comfortably on this."
"My hands are just simply too big to rest on the palmrest,"
"making it, unfortunately, just a straight-up no-go for me."
"And it's going to be a no-go for 68% of males,"
"and half of females as well."
"I also constantly use my right thumb on the trackpad"
"while writing in Word documents,"
"and the fact that keyboard and the trackpad"
"aren't centered on each other means"
"that I'm only using a small portion of a trackpad"
"that's already very undersized by today's standards."
"To be clear, the switches are good,"
"but maybe try it out at a Best Buy or Costco first"
"to make sure that the ergonomics work for you."
"- If you are able to get comfortable, though,"
"you'll have an excellent time typing on the Envy x360."
"I personally didn't have an issue with my tiny hands,"
"and the switches offer plenty of travel"
"while delivering a satisfying snap when you press them."
"Key consistency and stabilization"
"was also uncharacteristically good"
"for a laptop in this price band,"
"so I don't think you're gonna have trouble"
"getting up to full speed."
"As for the trackpad, it's less of a highlight."
"The tracking is still pretty good"
"despite the lack of a glass top,"
"but the small size keeps it from being exceptional,"
"or even very good."
"You will be able to get used to it,"
"but I'd personally be much happier"
"with a bigger bottom bezel, or better yet,"
"a taller screen and a larger trackpad."
"Now, to be clear, there are a number of areas"
"where the Spectre x360 is superior to the Envy."
"Windows Hello facial recognition is a real-nice-to-have,"
"although the fingerprint reader on the Envy"
"is still quite snappy for logging in."
"And the Spectre also comes with a pen included,"
"with the option for LTE, which could easily sway"
"someone who is constantly on the go."
"But then again, if you're gonna be on the go,"
"with how much better the core performance"
"and battery life are here, I feel like until HP"
"puts an AMD processor into a Spectre notebook"
"they have unintentionally killed"
"their flagship lineup right here."
"For the vast majority of people, the HP Envy x360"
"is gonna check all of the important boxes for an ultrabook."
"It's super powerful, especially for the price,"
"it feels excellent in the hand,"
"and aside from the screen aspect ratio,"
"I just have no real complaints about it."
"I can't even remember the last time"
"that an ultrabook came through the studio here"
"that was under $1,200 and managed to get a full-blown,"
"no-caveats recommendation from me."
"But this one certainly does, and I hope"
"that as more companies take AMD's mobile chips seriously,"
"we're gonna see more excellent performers at great prices,"
"like this one."
"Speaking of excellent performance at a great price,"
"our sponsor Drop.com is featuring"
"the Koss GMR-54X-ISO gaming headset."
"It's audiophile-approved and based on"
"a popular Koss headset, and the custom-engineered acoustics"
"for immersive 3D sound allow you to get positional cues"
"to hear where your enemies are coming from."
"There are some changes made from the original,"
"including reduced tension in the lightweight headband"
"for extend comfort, and it includes a cord splitter,"
"inline microphone with remote, and a detachable boom mic."
"The boom mic works with the PlayStation 4,"
"Xbox and Nintendo Switch, and more, without hassle,"
"and you can grab yours today,"
"with new users who sign up on Drop.com"
"getting $20 off this headset."
"If you guys enjoyed this video"
"and you just can't get enough AMD domination,"
"check out our full review of the Asus Zephyrus G14."
"It really is a lesson on how to build"
"a compact high-performance gaming notebook."
"Put AMD in it. Ah, ha-ha, got 'em."
"so a little over a week ago I reviewed"
"the HP Envy X360 15-inch it came with an"
"AMD processor it was good but I didn't"
"love it because the display they were"
"using it was a pretty poor display but"
"this is the 13-inch version and for its"
"price of 11.79 you're getting a 2K plus"
"OLED display and it looks really good on"
"this laptop now personally I prefer this"
"form factor a 13 inch laptop even though"
"the display is smaller it's just a lot"
"easier to carry it's lighter and it's"
"better for travel HP is using a"
"magnesium alloy with a bunch of ocean"
"bound Plastics to help save the"
"environment and overall the quality and"
"feel to it feels pretty good now this is"
"the Bluer model it does get a lot of"
"fingerprints on the chassis the top lid"
"is a little bit flexible but it's not"
"terrible you have the HP logo in the"
"middle the ports are not too bad like on"
"the left hand side you have an audio"
"jack and then you have your micro SD"
"card slot you have a USB a port again"
"I'm not a fan of these flaps they do"
"break easy so as I always say these HP"
"videos be very very careful when you're"
"plugging in a USB peripheral on the"
"right hand side you have two Thunderbolt"
"4 ports and another USB a port now"
"unfortunately there's no RJ45 but what"
"it does have is Wi-Fi 6E which means I"
"got to test out my new Deco xe75 Pro"
"Wi-Fi 6E tri-band mesh system by tp-link"
"who was kind enough to partner on this"
"video the speeds can go up to 2.4"
"gigabits per second but since my"
"internet connection is only one gigabit"
"per second it had zero problems handling"
"it the first thing I noticed is how much"
"smoother my Wi-Fi experience has been"
"compared to my old system my studio is"
"in a commercial condo and I'm surrounded"
"by other Wi-Fi networks that use older"
"Legacy bands but since the Deco xe75 pro"
"has a six gigahertz band it does a much"
"better job of avoiding any interference"
"and also acts as a backhaul the design"
"is super clean and it connects up to 200"
"devices there's three Lan ports on the"
"back two one gigabits per second ports"
"and one 2.5 gigabit per second port for"
"multi-gig internet now I'm using the try"
"pack which can cover up to 7 200 square"
"feet but if that's a bit too much"
"coverage there's a two pack option as"
"well upgrading from Wi-Fi 5 to Wi-Fi 6E"
"is the best upgrade you can make for a"
"better wi-fi experience The Deco xc75"
"Pro is one of the most affordable and"
"fastest Wi-Fi 6E mesh systems you can"
"buy today right now you can get up to"
"100 off until October 16th links will be"
"in the description down below now"
"opening up the laptop is tough with one"
"hand because this is a convertible like"
"the display can flip 360 Degrees which"
"means they have to be a little bit more"
"stringent on the hinge make it a bit"
"more stiff since it's going to be"
"constantly being open the one thing I"
"noticed right away is that the hinge"
"quality on the 30 inch model is better"
"than the 15 inch version because the"
"display is not as big so there's just"
"less wobble when you open it up in fact"
"the wobble on this display is very"
"comparable to a normal clamshell laptop"
"so I was quite impressed when I opened"
"up this display the keyboard is very"
"comfortable to type on it's a little bit"
"mushy in the middle but the keys feel"
"fantastic there's a nice click sound to"
"it which I always appreciate it's good"
"travel distance and I had zero issues"
"getting used to typing on it you have a"
"nice quick shortcut key to the HP"
"Command Center if you want to quickly"
"put it in performance or quiet mode but"
"you can also do things like use camera"
"features that you know lighten up your"
"face a bit better by creating this like"
"ring on the screen that uses white light"
"and also adjusts the exposure the"
"trackpad is right in the middle it feels"
"very comfortable to use it's very"
"accurate so no complaints there and the"
"sticker placement is actually good for"
"once now the 2880 by 1800 OLED display"
"looks absolutely gorgeous it is using a"
"glass panel so it can be a little bit"
"reflective depending on the light"
"scenario brightness is pretty good color"
"accuracy is obviously fantastic contrast"
"ratios are through the roof overall a"
"great panel to look at there is a bit of"
"pwm flicker it is 60 hertz but that pwm"
"flicker doesn't kick in until about 40"
"percent and lower there's Windows hello"
"facial recognition to log you in but"
"there's no fingerprint scanner in case"
"you want to use something physical"
"there's a bit of bezel on the bottom but"
"overall the bezels are fairly thin on"
"the sides now performance has been"
"pretty solid like this is an i7 1250u"
"CPU it doesn't beat out the ryzen 7"
"version I tested in the 15 inch model"
"when it comes to synthetic benchmarks"
"but depending on what you're doing this"
"excels in some areas and the R7 excels"
"in others for example if you're doing"
"anything specifically CPU related like"
"Mozilla Firefox or compiling code then"

"faster but if you're doing any sort of"
"video editing or creative work mostly"
"video editing where it needs to use that"
"integrated GPU then the 13 inch i7 1250u"
"is the better option now if you're just"
"doing General productivity it really"
"doesn't make a difference which process"
"you go with they both feel equally fast"
"and noise on this is really good right"
"now I have it on performance mode and"
"that gets up to about 43 to 45 decibels"
"but if you put it on balanced or quiet"
"mode you can get the fan noise to go"
"down below 40. heat management is also"
"fantastic I had no issues it does"
"obviously power throttle when the CPU"
"gets a bit too hot clock speeds tend to"
"stay a bit higher on the 15 inch model"
"just due to the bigger chassis but the"
"13 inch version performs very well for"
"everyday tasks now it does have two"
"speakers on the bottom it sounds good"
"but obviously not as good as front"
"firing speakers but everything was nice"
"and clear and there was no Distortion at"
"max volume now internally not much is"
"upgradable you do have a swappable nvme"
"SSD and a swappable Wi-Fi 6E card Ram is"
"soldered onto the motherboard you have"
"one copper heat pipe to cool the CPU and"
"integrated GPU plus a 66 watt hour"
"battery that gave me pretty good battery"
"life honestly for the price 11.79 I"
"think this is a pretty good deal not"
"only do you get a 2880 by 1800 OLED"
"display but you also get the pen"
"included in the Box I think the build"
"quality is slightly better than the"
"15-inch version just because the hinges"
"do a better job on a 13 inch display and"

"processor can this be my budget windows"
"art machine of my dreams let's find out"
"hello my name is brad i review tech for"

"cool but it's underpowered there's some"
"super cheap 200"
"android tablets out there but eh they're"

"around so you can set it up and"
"draw on it using the included pen"
"unfortunately and we're just gonna get"
"the bad news out of the way here at the"
"beginning the pen isn't as good as i was"
"hoping it would be but when you factor"
"in the price"
"it might be a trade-off that you're"
"willing to make to have a small"
"portable nice little windows laptop"
"let's take a look at what we've got in"
"the box we've got our power brick and"
"also the extension cable that plugs into"
"it"
"also we have the pen included also that"
"comes with the battery right here in the"
"box"
"you can upgrade it and get a"
"rechargeable version of this pen for 30"

"that pen will charge via usb then we"
"have the laptop"
"itself it looks pretty nice it's got"
"this nice brushed metal look it's a it's"
"a darker color it's not"
"ultra light in fact it weighs a good"
"amount but it's solid"
"it feels premium hp has made laptops"
"like this before but what makes this"
"particular one special is it's the amd"
"version the product i am checking out"
"here is the entry level configuration"
"that starts out at 650"
"dollars it's got a 13.3 full hd that's"
"1920 by 1080 screen"
"you could jump up to a 15 inch model"
"which has the same resolution"
"but a couple more ports in it on these"
"smaller screens especially a 13 inch"
"screen not having that higher resolution"
"doesn't really bother me much it looks"
"pretty good and it gets plenty bright at"
"300 nits"
"the viewing angles of the screen are"
"just okay for every position i was in"
"for drawing or using a laptop"
"it was just fine but when i got to"
"filming it i could really"
"see that when you get off to the side or"
"move it around"
"it gets kind of dark this is also a"
"touch enabled screen it's great for"
"pinching and zooming but also"
"the occasional accidental palm mark more"
"on that in a minute also worth pointing"
"out is this screen is a 16 by nine"
"aspect ratio inside we have 256"
"gigabyte ssd which is more than i"
"expected at this price point"
"like i mentioned before this one is"
"rocking an amd ryzen 3"
"4 300 u processor if you wanted to spec"
"this out with a better ryzen processor"
"like the 5 or the 7"
"you can do that too i'm not a benchmark"
"kind of guy but what i wanted to see"
"with this amd ryzen processor was"
"is it too slow for drawing an"
"illustration task does it stack up that"
"way"
"against intel and i'm happy to report it"
"ran adobe photoshop and the creative"
"suite"
"just fine probably not something i'd"
"want to do video editing on but for"
"illustration it was great this model"
"also comes with eight gigabytes of"
"memory built in or if you're an artist"
"or illustrator that's usually the base"
"point i tell most people to shoot for"
"when you're looking at a laptop is you"
"wanna go"
"eight gigabytes or higher you probably"
"don't wanna go under that and there's"
"some more good news here if you got a"
"phillips head screwdriver you could open"
"up the back pretty easily and install"
"more ram down the road if you need to"
"on the left side we have a headphone"
"jack a usb a port and a usb"
"c port that is not thunderbolt 3. in"
"this case"
"that's because we're rocking some amd"
"internals not intel on the right side we"
"have a power port another usb a port and"
"also"
"a micro sd card slot i've seen photos of"
"these before but the usb"
"a ports are the kind that kind of flap"
"open to make the laptop center i thought"
"that was kind of cool and you can make"
"it talk"
"hi i should also point out if you"
"upgrade to that 15-inch version of this"
"laptop there's more ports"
"for example it adds an hdmi port along"
"the side as well there aren't a lot of"
"bells and whistles to this"
"budget-friendly laptop so"
"things like the camera it's only a 720p"
"camera it's only okay but they did"
"manage to fit in"
"a kill switch for that camera and also a"
"fingerprint reader on the keyboard the"
"battery on this thing was pretty good"
"hp rates it about 12 hours of battery"
"life"
"i would say drawing in photoshop i was"
"getting closer to around"
"six hours which is decent windows"
"laptops have come a long way"
"in recent years the low end laptops feel"
"a lot more premium now than they used to"
"this keyboard feels pretty good to type"
"on the all aluminum body gives it a more"
"premium feel in general and even the"
"speakers sound good"
"the speaker grilles are along the bottom"
"of the laptop so"
"it's a bit muffled in laptop mode"
"because of that but it sounds really"
"good when you prop it up for drawing"
"because"
"the speakers are now facing you speaking"
"of drawing the angles on this are pretty"
"good"
"when you flip it around you're probably"
"going to want to hold it with one hand"
"since it is a laptop putty the pull"
"pressure of your palm is gonna close the"
"thing but i found it was pretty"
"comfortable to rest my hand along the"
"side"
"while drawing on it and propping it at"
"the angle i wanted to use it at and that"
"360 degree hinge"
"holds up pretty well that's something"
"that i worry about the most on these"
"laptops is i have"
"no idea what that hinge is going to be"
"like two years from now one thing i did"
"miss is there's no real place to put the"
"pen there's nowhere to store it on the"
"inside there's no magnets in the pen or"
"along the side of the screen so you"
"could stick the pen to it"
"the pen just kind of is there another"
"thing to be aware of is the fan"
"tended to be on when i was drawing on"
"this thing and the fan points like right"
"it's at the bottom so it points right at"
"your wrist while you're drawing on there"
"so if you don't like hot air blowing on"
"you while you're drawing"
"it does that on to the drawing"
"experience"
"so this is the pen that comes with the"
"hp envy x360 and the main thing to know"
"about this pen"
"is in the back of it there is a battery"
"and what you find in many battery"
"powered pens"
"is that you get some wave and jitter to"
"your lines and this pen"
"is no different so i'm starting this"
"process this little demo here that i'm"
"about to do"
"in autodesk sketchbook and and the"
"reason why"
"is because sketchbook sentence to have"
"wigglier"
"lines wigglier i'm trying having a hard"
"time getting that word out"
"than many other applications and that's"
"totally what i'm seeing here let me zoom"
"in here so you can see"
"these aren't like super slow like"
"sometimes i'll go really slow"
"to get the wobble in there these are"
"just kind of normal speed lines"
"and and they look nasty they look"
"absolutely"
"horrible the other thing that was"
"happening in sketchbook"
"is i was getting these palm recognition"
"dots"
"i should point out i'm wearing a drawing"
"glove people ask that in every video"
"and the main reason i wear that is is"
"not so much to reduce these"
"uh palm rejection dots the main reason"
"is because it's august"
"and it's hot and my hand sweats and"
"sticks to this smooth glass screen"
"there is a way to turn on streamlining"
"with these lines which is how i drew"
"most of this character"
"so your wine will start really jittery"
"but when you let go"
"it'll come in there and it'll smooth it"
"out for you"
"so there are some ways around that if"
"you choose to go this route"
"let's jump over to photoshop here and"
"i'm going to go ahead and create a new"
"document really quick"
"because in photoshop i feel like i'm"
"getting better performance than"
"i do in an app like sketchbook now you"
"do see"
"some wiggle to the lines but it's"
"you know it's not as bad as what we were"
"seeing before let me undo that brush"
"stroke"
"and let me get some lines in here just"
"some normal speeded lines"
"i'm making up words here as i go and you"
"can see there's some jitter to these"
"i can turn on smoothing in photoshop and"
"once i get it up to about 20 percent you"
"see these lines get"
"pretty nice actually those look pretty"
"good so there are ways to turn on"
"smoothing"
"and to get this pen looking better than"
"it was before"
"this also has smoothing on but i'm going"
"to just kind of go through the pressure"
"and the pressure curve is okay it it"
"seems to at times take a little while to"
"turn"
"on it has i would call it a strong"
"initial"
"activation which means you have to apply"
"more force"
"before it starts happening so if i just"
"drag it across the screen nothing"
"i start applying force and then i get a"
"line so if you're really light drawer"
"this probably isn't going to be a good"
"fit for you"
"so overall i would rate this pen a c"
"minus"
"if you use smoothing and if you don't"
"have to worry too much"
"about the the initial activation force"
"it's okay it works you can create good"
"artwork with this"
"if your software is helping you out a"
"little bit if you need that perfect pen"
"feel if you're looking for something"
"really smooth and really nice"
"out of the box without having to worry"
"about doing all these edits and"
"customizations"
"this is probably one to pass on"
"let's talk about those pros and those"
"cons the pro"
"is definitely the price here getting"
"this form factor at this price"
"can be a little bit hard to come by it"
"seems like as soon as you get into the"
"convertibles or the tablet e space"
"the price starts getting really really"
"high i saw some configurations on amazon"
"of the same exact laptop except it had"
"better specs"
"but it was only a little bit more and"
"overall generally i thought that the"
"price"
"versus value that you're getting for"
"this and the way you can customize those"
"specs on hp's website"
"was was a very good value if you're an"
"artist what it comes down to is you have"
"to ask yourself is do you need a great"
"pen"
"and if you need a great pen like the"
"perfect pen this probably isn't the"
"laptop for you"
"if you are looking to take notes or just"
"want a pen to use on the side or want to"
"do some light sketching from time to"
"time or take up a new hobby i think this"
"is a fantastic laptop"
"in fact in general i thought it was a"
"very good value obviously it's not a"
"super powerful laptop so if you're doing"
"drawing and illustration you're going to"
"be just fine if you're going to go into"
"3d work or you want to use it for gaming"
"i'm not so sure so that was the nvx 360."
"what do you think is this something that"
"you're interested in do you want to see"
"more reviews of windows all-in-ones let"
"me know down below in the comment"
"section"
"thank you guys for watching and i'll"
"talk to you in a couple of days"

"battery life good performance and an all"
"metal design and best of all it doesn't"
"break the bank it came in at a very good"
"price well I couldn't wait to see what"
"HP had in store for its refresh here for"
"2022. I took delivery of it I did a live"
"unboxing of it and I'm really impressed"
"with it now one of the key differences"
"this time around is you can now get this"
"with an OLED option a full HD OLED"
"display still 15.6 inches but having an"
"OLED on this at this price point is a"
"Big Boon for a lot of people now I have"
"the full HD IPS model we'll see how that"
"does it has excellent battery life and"
"once again it doesn't disappoint in that"
"category improved performance with an"
"all new processor we'll talk about that"
"and it has an all metal design we'll see"
"if this all once again makes this one of"
"the best mid-tier valuable in terms of"
"price to Performance ratio convertibles"
"here for 2022. stay tuned we're going to"
"find out now hey everybody it's Andrew"
"and this is my review of the HP Envy"
"X360 all new for 2022. coming up"
"[Music]"
"now before we get to the unboxing I want"
"to let everyone know in the interest of"
"transparency in full disclosure are not"
"being paid by HP I'm not being sponsored"
"by HP all the opinions you're about to"
"hear are my own HP is not getting copy"
"approval that means they're seeing this"
"video for the first time just like you"
"though this unit is on loan from HP and"
"once this review is done I'll be sending"
"it back pricing for the X360 two-in-one"
"starts at"
"639.99 over at hp's website that to me"
"is a steal considering the upgrade"
"you're getting this year over last"
"year's model fully loaded with the new"
"OLED option you're looking at"
"1049.99 and price here as configured"
"with my review unit"
"899 dollars over at Best Buy I will"
"leave a link in the description below"
"for more information and where you can"
"buy it and I think when you look at the"
"price to Performance ratio here this to"
"me is a steal I would not hesitate on"
"this I would jump on it this is an"
"excellent two-in-one convertible"
"especially for the price and with the"
"specs in pricing out of the way let's"
"find out what you get inside the Box"
"let's open it up"
"it's the Nightfall black think you could"
"also get this in silver but I don't know"
"if that's only for the Intel version I'm"
"not sure and it feels a little bit of"
"heft on this again 15.6 inch display all"
"right let's see what some warranty"
"information some product information"
"that's pretty typical so we've got our"
"power charger it's USBC 65 Watts from HP"
"of course and I don't see the pen so"
"we'll have to bring our own pen I guess"
"and of course we get the unit here"
"get it out of the plastic"
"and there she is and that's of course"
"the Nightfall black and she is pretty so"
"you can see there's a vent on the bottom"
"there"
"sort of yeah you can see the fans there"
"actually coming through a little bit of"
"a fingerprint magnet because seal ready"
"Let's uh let's take a look at the"
"back of it first and then we'll get to"
"the ports there's some Envy branding"
"here you can see the color here it's"
"beautiful again you're gonna have to"
"keep it clean boxy look I guess you know"
"the linear edges and so forth now when"
"it comes to the fit and finish of it I"
"would say it's pretty good although I"
"noticed a little Flex in the chassis and"
"on the keyboard deck but not much but"
"again at this price point I'm not"
"surprised but for the most part this old"
"metal design really holds up and one of"
"the things I'm seeing a big Improvement"
"is less green wobble than you got last"
"year so when you're typing you don't"
"have a lot of movement on the screen and"
"that was a big complaint last year and"
"I'm glad they remedied that in this"
"version"
"okay let's check out the port selection"
"on the left side is a USB a port next to"
"that is a 3.5 millimeter microphone"
"headphone combo Jack and I love to see"
"this a full-size SD card reader and the"
"card sit flush with the unit they click"
"right in there and I love that now on"
"the right side are two USBC ports that"
"are full functions supporting data"
"charge and display out now no longer do"
"you need a barrel pin connection to"
"charge this laptop as this does support"
"USBC charging hence they give you a USBC"
"adapter this time around now"
"unfortunately these are not USB C4 ports"
"which would give you a lot of the"
"functionality you'd get from a"
"thunderbolt port and it was not able to"
"get it to work with my Thunderbolt drive"
"that I use for SSD storage that didn't"
"work on this so it's not usbc4"
"you can put it into the tent mode"
"and then of course presentation mode and"
"then of course tablet mode and again"
"it's a little heavy for a tablet but you"
"can do all the things you need to do now"
"there are four total options when it"
"comes to the display and it'll depend on"
"whether or not you got the Intel version"
"of this laptop or the AMD if you go with"
"the AMD there are two options I have the"
"IPS version with the 250-nit display and"
"there's also a new OLED option that's"
"also full HD 1920x1080 that's the first"
"time they're offering an OLED version on"
"this panel in terms of an AMD laptop now"
"if you go with the Intel version of this"
"laptop then you can go with the IPS that"
"can get as bright as 400 nits and then"
"there's a brand new Quad HD version"
"that's 2560 by 1440 that also has a high"
"refresh rate 120 hertz and that can get"
"as bright as 300 nits again intel only"
"now HP sends over the IPS version that"
"can get as bright as 215 nits now that's"
"not what I I was really hoping for here"
"I was hoping to go above 400 nits even"
"but of course if you go with the OLED"
"option which I highly encourage you to"
"do so that will get as bright as 400"
"nits but this one is rated at 250 nits"
"in terms of the brightness I actually"
"measured 260 again below my 300 nit"
"threshold"
"now one thing you need to be aware of"
"this is a very glossy display you will"
"notice that glare and Reflections"
"depending on your lighting conditions"
"but I think the OLED version is going to"
"have less of an issue because that will"
"get as bright as 400 nits as opposed to"
"the 216 nits I measured in this IPS"
"model having that higher brightness will"
"reduce the amount of glare Reflections"
"they have to contend with but it won't"
"totally eliminate it so just keep that"
"in mind and in everyday use for the past"
"week or so that I've had this has been"
"actually pretty good now this retains a"
"16 to 9 aspect ratio so what does that"
"mean you won't get the black bars on the"
"top and the bottom as you would with a"
"three to two aspect ratio or even a 16"
"to 10. so retaining that 16 to 9 on a"
"15.6 inch device I don't mind that and"
"you also get 88 screen to body ratio"
"that means you're going to get those"
"really small bezels so you don't have to"
"contend with the black bars and you get"
"the small bezels I'll take it now as far"
"as watching Netflix Amazon YouTube it's"
"been great on this again that is a"
"glossy display you'll have to keep that"
"in mind and but for the most part it's"
"worked out pretty well and of course the"
"OLED will be even more enhanced in terms"
"of the really deep blacks the vibrant"
"colors the really high contrast that you"
"get with an OLED display so for those"
"spend the extra money I think it's a 90"
"premium and that to me is well worth it"
"although it won't do quite as well in"
"terms of the battery life we'll get into"
"that in a little bit now if you're a"
"content creator I would stay away from"
"this IPS panel judging by these numbers"
"that I was able to measure on here"
"especially the color gamut not being"
"very good in terms of coverage that's 61"
"percent srgb 46 Adobe RGB 45 percent of"
"the DCI P3 wide color gamut and 44 ntsc"
"I would go with the OLED model you'll do"
"much better in terms of that coverage"
"you'll do better in the color accuracy"
"I'm pretty sure that this has a pretty"
"high Delta e score 3.03 meaning it's not"
"the most color accurate out there we'd"
"like to see it below too so if you do"
"any type of content creation go with the"
"OLED it'll do better better in terms of"
"that coverage of the color gamut it'll"
"be more color accurate and it'll be"
"better for Photoshop Lightroom video"
"editing and of course color grading and"
"as I mentioned earlier this is a"
"multi-touch display not only can use"
"your fingers but it also can use the pen"
"now HP didn't send over the pen with"
"this review unit but I was able to use"
"the HP pen sent over with the Specter"
"X360 13.5 inch and it worked perfectly"
"for taking notes sketching out diagrams"
"or artwork it'll be great for the note"
"taker or the digital artist and the pen"
"sticks magnetically to the side so you"
"won't lose it now to charge it it does"
"use USBC for those wondering and this"
"being a two-in-one convertible means you"
"could put it into the different modes"
"you've got the tent mode which is great"
"for recipes in the kitchen watching"
"movies Netflix Amazon YouTube has been"
"great in that mode the same could be"
"said for the stand or what I like to"
"call the presentation mode and of course"
"you could put it into the tablet mode"
"great for use with the pen"
"so big improvements when it comes to the"
"camera over last year's version of"
"course they now have gone to their five"
"megapixel camera and I think HP has done"
"an outstanding job in 2022 with their"
"cameras this is no exception they've"
"gone with this five megapixel as I"
"mentioned capable and what you're seeing"
"here is 1440p video what do you think"
"about the video quality what do you"
"think about the audio another big"
"Improvement is the fact that this is now"
"an IR camera allowing you to log in with"
"face recognition with Windows hello the"
"setup was easy and it's worked well so"
"that's been pretty good but one thing to"
"note they took away the fingerprint"
"scanner that we found in last year's"
"model no longer on the keyboard you now"
"can only log in with face recognition in"
"terms of that Windows hello or use your"
"passcode or password now as far as their"
"shutter switch it's still here it's the"
"key actually on the keyboard that allows"
"you to turn off the webcam for more"
"security and privacy we like to see that"
"it's got all the presence detection"
"features it has the auto frame being the"
"backlighting all the auto backlight so"
"make sure you're always not only in"
"frame but it also has the best lighting"
"condition to be presented to the viewer"
"so I think this is a really big"
"Improvement here in 2022 over last"
"year's model and I'm glad to see it here"
"on this Envy line especially for this"
"price what you get for the price here is"
"pretty amazing but I'm curious to know"
"what you think let me know in the"
"comment section below now good news when"
"it comes to getting inside this laptop"
"no longer are there any screws"
"underneath the rubber strips you don't"
"have to remove them all you need to do"
"is just remove the screws that are"
"visible outside of the unit of course"
"and pop off the bottom plate with either"
"guitar pick or a pry tool and you're in"
"and the better news is exactly what's"
"upgradable on this not only is the SSD"
"upgradeable the Wi-Fi card is upgradable"
"but the RAM is upgradable so the"
"trifectas here as far as upgradability"
"we like to see that now this review unit"
"sent over by HP has 12 gigabytes of RAM"
"and it's the ddr4 3200 Ram we saw last"
"year so we're not getting a bump up in"
"terms of the ddr5 we've been seeing here"
"in 2022 a little bit of a negative but"
"the fact of the matter is you could put"
"it in yourself and you can go beyond the"
"16 gigabytes which you can configure at"
"hp's website you can actually put it I"
"would say two 16 gigabyte sticks in here"
"for 32 gigabytes of RAM and it'll be"
"running of course in dual Channel mode"
"and this review unit has 512 gigabytes"
"of SSD storage the good news is it's"
"slotted in now judging by these reads"
"and writes these are gen 3 equivalent"
"speeds not the faster Gen 4 we'd like to"
"see here in 2022. the good news is you"
"could change it out yourself and put in"
"a faster drive now when it comes to the"
"Wi-Fi this has the mediatek Wi-Fi 6E"
"along with Bluetooth 5.2 it's a combo"
"card and as I mentioned it's slotted in"
"upgradable by the user so if you want to"
"change it out you have that option"
"that's always good and as far as the"
"Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth working on this"
"unit so far no issues on either front"
"both working as expected"
"okay let's talk about the keyboard and"
"I'm a big fan of the keyboard when it"
"comes to the tactility the key travel"
"very comfortable your fingers never feel"
"like you're going to bottom out"
"comfortable for typing long emails"
"comfortable for typing long documents so"
"it's been really good in that regard now"
"they did away with the numpads so those"
"number crunchers who do Excel"
"spreadsheets are going to be a little"
"bit disappointed but they did away with"
"that last year so that's a carryover to"
"this year so for those that want it you"
"don't get it now as far as the"
"multi-stage backlight that this has the"
"keys light up white and it's easy to"
"differentiate to see the contrast"
"between the keys and the white backlight"
"so that worked out well allowing you to"
"get work done in a dark room or a dimly"
"lit environment that's good and it has a"
"nice persistent touchpad it has a mylar"
"finish it's a smooth finish and it"
"allows for smooth scrolling it's pretty"
"responsive and when it comes to the"
"gestures everything works as you'd"
"expect good job on the touchpad and it's"
"a nicely sized touchpad at that okay"
"let's get into the performance and we're"
"seeing a nice year-over-year performance"
"increase here not a huge increase but a"
"nice increase nonetheless this is"
"running the brand new ryzen 7 5825u"
"that's an 8 core 16 thread processor of"
"course from AMD in their ryzen series"
"and as you can see a higher PC Mark 10"
"score higher single core multi-core"
"score across the board in both the"
"geekbench 5 and the cinebench R23 test"
"showing that this is a very good"
"performer for everyday tasks such as"
"Microsoft Office email web browsing you"
"could do 1080p video editing it's got"
"the integrated Radeon graphics it's not"
"going to blow you away in terms of the"
"graphics performance but you can do some"
"video editing and some 3D rendering I"
"wouldn't do 4K video editing on this"
"you'd want to look for something with a"
"discrete GPU and when it comes to gaming"
"I think it goes without saying this is"
"not a dedicated gaming laptop there are"
"better options out there with discrete"
"gpus this has the integrated Radeon"
"graphics but if you lower some of the"
"settings you can get somewhat play label"
"formates on some of the more popular"
"titles again this is good for the"
"occasional game here and there but as"
"your main gaming laptop I would look at"
"other options"
"and one of the reasons we're seeing"
"pretty good performance on this is"
"because I'm seeing little thermal"
"throttling when I ran the prime 95"
"stress test to see if this will power"
"throttle under heavy load I noticed that"
"it would get a little bit high in terms"
"of the temperatures but never getting"
"overly hot and never reducing the clock"
"speeds to the point where performance is"
"compromised it's actually had pretty"
"good clock speeds throughout now when it"
"comes to the fan noise the fans will"
"kick in on their heavy load getting"
"about 45 or 46 decibels at the loudest"
"when you're under that performance mode"
"but under the regular mode you're pretty"
"much quiet all the all around that's"
"pretty good now when it comes to the"
"surface temperatures relatively cool"
"throughout in terms of the surface"
"temperatures there is a few hot spots"
"the one above the keyboard below the"
"display and then there's one on the"
"underside as you see here but for the"
"most part remained relatively cool"
"okay let's talk about the battery life"
"and as I mentioned earlier this is a 51"
"watt hour battery and before you jump to"
"conclusion saying that's too small the"
"battery life on this has been excellent"
"scoring over 14 hours on my continuous"
"web serving test over wi-fi at 115 nits"
"you're looking at anywhere between 11 to"
"12 hours in real world mix usage and"
"that is excellent here for 2022 very"
"efficient chipset excellent battery life"
"so for those Road Warriors that need a"
"longevity in terms of that battery life"
"this will not disappoint you now the"
"included 65 watt USBC power adapter"
"takes about an hour and 40 minutes to"
"charge this laptop to full not too bad"
"in terms of charging"
"all right let's talk about the audio and"
"when it comes to the audio there are two"
"bottom facing speakers as you can see"
"here and I thought the vibe could be a"
"little bit louder but I thought it was"
"decent and the mids were decent and"
"there was a hint of bass not the best"
"audio I've heard but again at this price"
"point I'm not expecting outstanding"
"MacBook Pro quality audio but for the"
"most part for a convertible it's okay"
"let's give it a listen with epidemic"
"sound if you want to save 10 off"
"epidemic sound see the link in the"
"description below now let's give this a"
"listen"
"[Music]"
"all right"
"[Music]"
"all right folks let's bring it all home"
"what do I think about the HP Envy X360"
"here for 2022 and I gotta say on some"
"levels a lot of big improvements"
"especially the CPU performance year over"
"year nice increase there I like the fact"
"that they're now offering this with a"
"OLED display that's something we didn't"
"get last year especially with this AMD"
"ryzen model that is going to be a"
"welcome addition because I think you"
"need to stay away from this full HD IPS"
"display which barely hit 260 nits on my"
"measurements definitely not bright"
"enough and it's a highly glossy display"
"which compounds the issue so if you're"
"gonna get this I would go with the OLED"
"but there is a silver lining to this"
"full HD IPS display and that would be"
"that amazing battery life getting over"
"14 hours on my continuous web surfing"
"test over wi-fi at 115 nits and real"
"world mixed usage you're looking at 11"
"to 12 hours at a minimum on this device"
"which is excellent here for 2022. The"
"Thermals are excellent on this as well"
"the port selection is excellent although"
"I I would have liked to have seen usb4"
"on this instead you get USB 3.2 but for"
"the most part I like the fact that"
"you're getting that full-size SD card"
"reader and the card sit flush with the"
"unit so good job on the ports and we're"
"getting a much improved webcam this time"
"around going with that 5 megapixel"
"camera capable of 1440p video and that's"
"going to be great for your video"
"conferencing a big improvement over last"
"year"
"now if you're going to buy this get the"
"OLED option it's only ninety dollars"
"more and I think for that price you're"
"getting a lot for the money I'm going to"
"give this a score of 87 making the HP"
"Envy X 360 here for 2022 definitely"
"worth your money so please hit the like"
"button please subscribe please share"
"this video don't forget to leave a"
"comment in that comment section below"
"let me know how I'm doing let me know if"
"there's a device or something out there"
"you think I should review I'll do my"
"best to try to make that happen don't"
"forget to check me out on Facebook"
"Twitter Instagram and of course my"
"website"
"amdtechreviews.com so until next time"
"this is Andrew from AMD Tech"
"see ya"
"this is lisa from mobile tech review and"
"this is the"
"hp envy x360 15"
"or 15z specifically which means the amd"
"ryzen inside yay that"
"so i always like the envy line because"
"well they sit between the pavilion which"
"is a pretty low end line from hp"
"and the very pricey spectre line and"
"you've got things like an aluminum clad"
"chassis here the usual 360 degree hinges"
"pen support on board and more we're"
"going to look at it now"
"so the this model starts around 699 list"
"price currently actually 659 on hp's"
"website"
"and that gets you a rise in five eight"
"gigs of ram a 256 gig ssd and a full hd"
"touch and pen compatible display not too"
"bad"
"really considering this is a pretty"
"classy chassis a nice design all that"
"sort of thing"
"and the mod that we have is a little"
"higher in configuration and list price"
"is about 9.99 you'll probably find it"
"for less again"
"and now it has 16 gigs of ram 512 gig"
"ssd horizon 7 and a full hd"
"brighter version of the display there's"
"two versions of the display with the amd"
"models one's 250 nits ooh"
"that and the 400 nit display we have"
"which is like 80"
"more totally worth the spend i would say"
"unless you work in really dark places"
"all the time especially because hp"
"displays are very reflective"
"so inside we have amd ryzen like i said"
"so this is a 5000 series set of cpus"
"we have the ryzen 7 5700u"
"it gets a little confusing what ryzen's"
"doing with the u-series cpus this year"
"so"
"it's a 5000 series which is normally the"
"latest but"
"some of them like the 5700 and the 5500"
"this is also available with"
"are based on a modified zen 2"
"architecture not the latest"
"zen 3 architecture that said it's still"
"a good enough cpu"
"and in terms of thermals and battery"
"life it's still"
"doing better than intel and so it's"
"desirable nonetheless even it's not the"
"ultimate fastest and it allows them to"
"sell it to you for this great price so"
"yeah i mean we're talking about eight"
"percent difference in performance"
"between this and a zen 3 architecture"
"not something you want to kill yourself"
"over if you need to save some money"
"speaking of intel there is an intel"
"model which"
"is the 15 t which is typical for hp"
"lingo with their z's for amd and ts for"
"intel that one is also available with"
"the 4k"
"400 nit ips display all the displays are"
"ips on this model so if you really have"
"to have a 4k display you're going to"
"have to go to intel and spend some more"
"money too where it's available with core"
"i5 and core i7"
"intel 11th gen tiger lake u-series cpus"
"since this is basically a big ultrabook"
"a 15-inch convertible which is pretty"
"typical for convertibles"
"you're looking at amd radeon graphics or"
"if you got the intel version you'd have"
"iris xe graphics there's"
"really not room for a d gpu in here and"
"again for this one they're keeping"
"the price down that said it's perfectly"
"fine for things like"
"well content consumption anything can"
"handle that these days"
"and even for things like doing some"
"photoshop it's actually"
"perfectly fine for casual everyday sort"
"of use then"
"a little bit of video editing i"
"personally prefer h series more powerful"
"cpus that use 45 watts of power if"
"you're gonna be"
"serious about doing 4k video editing or"
"something like that"
"build quality on this is pretty good"
"it's stamped aluminum chassis again it's"
"nice enough looking in that minimalist"
"way that i think ages well and"
"offends no one shows some fingerprints"
"but not a lot it's got"
"pretty good structural rigidity on board"
"the weight is pretty reasonable"
"for a convertible of this size ports are"
"pretty good on this in terms of the"
"number and selection you've got"
"two usb a ports and those are 10 gigabit"
"per second we have one usbc"
"10 gigabit per second and no thunderbolt"
"because not"
"intel there's that hdmi 2.0 a"
"headphone jack of course and a full-size"
"sd card slot yay that so"
"this is aimed toward consumer content"
"creator type so that's nice to have the"
"sd card slot on board"
"display on this again we have the full"
"hd 400 nit display"
"i on hp's website it says it comes with"
"their magnetically attached active pen"
"which is n trig now called microsoft pen"
"protocol 2.0"
"with tilt support but we didn't get the"
"pen in the box but we'll show you the"
"one that comes with the spectre"
"anyway hopefully you'll get a pen in the"
"box if you want one"
"the display on this subjectively is nice"
"looking and hp says that they calibrated"
"for"
"under delta e of 2.0 which is pretty"
"good and in fact it's true"
"you look at it and you say that's a nice"
"pleasant display most people enjoy"
"watching content on it it's obviously"
"not a super wide gamut and again"
"reflections it's an annoying thing with"
"hp's consumer laptops they"
"have plenty of reflections the pen works"
"decently on this"
"entry is not my favorite but"
"it is catching up with wacom aes and"
"still not as good as wacom emr or an"
"apple pencil but"
"certainly is good for note-taking if"
"you're editing photos which is the idea"
"with this if you're doing creative kind"
"of stuff and if you want to do some"
"drawing"
"it'll do the job for you in terms of"
"performance it is where we expect it to"
"be which is pretty darn good even if"
"it's not the apex of what ryzen can do"
"right now and it holds its own certainly"
"versus intel"
"11th gen if not outperforming it have"
"been a multi-core test not on single"
"core so much"
"anyway it's a good performer and the"
"selling point with ryzen is the fact"
"that it runs cooler and uses less power"
"than"
"seven nanometer process it does we'll"
"show you the internals it does even have"
"two fans that's a lot of cooling"
"actually for this and"
"uh you've got a bunch of powerful"
"profiles to choose from for actually"
"anything from what's called quiet so you"
"must never hear the fans all the way to"
"full performance and it's not typically"
"a noisy laptop nor does it get burning"
"hot to the touch it's cooler than most"
"spectres for example which tend to be"
"hot customers because they're pushing"
"the performance and the size and the"
"thinness there"
"more than they do with the envy line"
"speaking of battery life it's a 51 watt"
"hour battery which is okay it's kind of"
"more standard for a 13-inch ultrabook"
"but hey"
"it's not bad and given the fact that we"
"have a fairly powerful platform going on"
"hp claims up to 13 hours of battery life"
"and manufacturers claims are optimistic"
"but we were doing about"
"nine on this with brightness set to 150"
"hits"
"mix of productivity streaming video a"
"little bit of creative work in photoshop"
"doing that for about half an hour of the"
"time it comes with a 65 watt fast"
"charger which can go from"
"empty to 50 full in 30 minutes and the"
"50 to 100 is always slower on"
"laptop charging and phone charging as a"
"matter of fact too to increase"
"battery health there is a fingerprint"
"scanner embedded in the keyboard deck"
"there is no windows hello ir camera for"
"facial recognition login"
"but for the price that's totally fair"
"the webcam is your usual"
"okay webcam and there is a privacy"
"shutter the keyboard is backlit"
"in white and i like the tactile feel of"
"this nice and crispy"
"key spring back all that sort of thing"
"not mushy at all not in deep travel by"
"any means but"
"nonetheless i found it pleasant to type"
"on and the track pad is"
"spacious certainly and works just fine"
"to take off the aluminum bottom cover"
"there are two"
"visible torx t5 screws and four two here"
"and two here"
"phillips head screws that are not"
"visible you have to pull off the rubber"
"strips here"
"now if you do it carefully you can leave"
"the adhesive intact other than the"
"occasional"
"cat hair that sticks to it so you can"
"put them back on again"
"that's pretty annoying but it gets worse"
"because there are some very tenacious"
"clips here"
"work around the hinge area first lift it"
"up and then"
"work your way around to get this"
"aluminum cover off"
"they make you work for it folks which is"
"kind of a shame because"
"this is more upgradable than usual for a"
"15-inch convertible basically ultrabook"
"so here yeah i know it looks like a war"
"zone right because i've had to pull up"
"some of the thermal tape"
"but here are the two fans here which is"
"quite a lot of cooling for something"
"with well"
"basically ultrabook cpu and integrated"
"radeon graphics this is the m.2 ssd slot"
"here so you could upgrade that yourself"
"and that's"
"not too hard to get to obviously pretty"
"small speaker drivers flanking in the 51"
"watt"
"hour battery and we have the socketed"
"wi-fi six card with bluetooth five which"
"is an intel ax"
"200 card so you want to know about this"
"cover right so this is the special treat"
"you don't usually see"
"and that is and believe me this has a"
"lot of clips too this heat shield here"
"two ram slots so uh-huh you could"
"upgrade this after the fact if you have"
"the patience and care of a saint to take"
"off this bottom cover"
"so that's the hp ndx 360 15-inch for"
"2021 with ryzen inside"
"i applaud what you get for the price"
"honestly and envies usually are a good"
"deal"
"it's a nice looking aluminum clad"
"machine 360 degree hinges pen support"
"touch screen"
"and pretty good keyboard on this and the"
"upgradability if you can tolerate trying"
"to get inside this"
"is really unusually good for a 15-inch"
"convertible ultrabook i mean you got two"
"ram slots"
"of course your m.2 is socketed and your"

"in the form the Inspiron 13 2 & 1 if"
"you're not into convertibles then Asus"
"have a pretty good option as well call"
"the Zen book 3rd"
"around the same price so thanks for"
"watching our review of the HP Envy x-360"
"and for all things tech log on a gas"
"history 16 com"
"Hi everyone. Today, we have the HP Envy X360 Convertible laptop."
"This 2021-edition premium laptop is brand new to the market. So thanks to HP for sending me this review unit."
"This is not a sponsored video. The box has a minimal design and shows the laptop and HP branding."
"Inside the box, you have the laptop, some manuals, and an AC power adapter. However, you're still able to use your USB-C charger."
"The HP Envy 15 focuses on laptops and products, specifically for creators. The model # for this laptop is 15-eu0097nr."
"Although this color is shown to be black on the website, it's not really black. More like a grey. The logo is creatively shown in the middle."
"It has an aluminum body made from recycled materials. Even the packaging is recycled. A very environmental-friendly initiative by HP."
"There are 2 hinges, 1 of them with the 'ENVY' display and a heat sink in the bottom."
"This is a 2-in-1 laptop so it can be easily used as a tablet or a laptop."
"On the left side, you have USB-A, HDMI, and USB- C ports, and an audio jack. The USB-C port is not a thunderbolt port."
"On the right side, you have an SD card reader, USB-A port, and an ac adapter port."
"You get a 15.6"" screen with a screen-to-body ratio of 89% and ultra-slim bezels."
"The touchpad is 19% bigger and placed in the center compared to other laptop brands. It has a slippery and sleek feel to it."
"The power button is made a bit harder to press. This is to avoid accidental shutoff."
"For extra privacy, you get camera shutter and mute mic buttons. These options secure your privacy and safety."
"Overall, I like the organized keyboard layout. One annoyance was that the location of the fingerprint reader is down with the arrows. I'm used to it being on the top."
"This laptop weighs 4.11 lbs (1.8 Kg). I really like these 2-in-1 designs."
"Display features: 15.6"" IPS FHD display and 400 nits. For a base model, you'll get 250 nits."
"This touchscreen laptop is equipped with Bang&Olufsen speakers for the best audio (which is what I have in my Audi)."
"This video footage is on the HP webcam. Judge the video and audio for yourself."
"This laptop has an AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor and 16GB RAM. This specific model (15-eu0097nr) costs $999 plus tax, for a total of $1093."
"The base model has an AMD Ryzen 5 5500U processor and 8GB RAM."
"I ran a Geekbench 5 test. Cpu scores are 969 (single-core score) and 5990 (multi-core score). The GPU score is 8085."
"I recommend this laptop for creators and editors, but not if you work with large files because you don't get a graphics card. Same thing for gamers. Recommended for casual gamers, not for professionals."
"This laptop will be available in India in 3-4 months for approx. 100,000 Rs."
"Wireless technology specs: Wi-Fi 6 and BlueTooth 5.0 combo. Battery life: fast charge and 50% in 30 min."
"Battery life: 12 hrs for video playback, 11 hrs web browsing, and 5-6 hrs for editing in 4K."
"Again, this is not a sponsored video. This laptop is a loaner unit for 14 days. Overall, I'm impressed with this laptop."
"Shoutout to Anurag_singh0017 for following me on Instagram and subscribing to my channel. Make sure you follow and subscribe also to hear your name on this channel."
"And this completes today's video. I'll see you in the next one."

"on it's just not available yet and for"
"those wondering what's the difference"
"between the 2021 model and this year's"
"model well this chart will show you some"
"of those differences"
"and with the specs and pricing out of"
"the way let's find out what you get"
"inside the Box let's open it up"
"lifting the lid you greeted by the unit"
"itself we're going to get to that in"
"just a moment but let's find out what"
"else you get you get some product"

"information as well now you get a 65"
"watt USBC power adapter it's a braided"
"cable and you get the power cord they"
"also sent over the HP tilt pen that"
"gives you extra pen tips and it charges"
"via USBC we're going to test that out"
"later on as well now handling this unit"
"for the first time I love the blue color"
"on this this is thin light and it's all"
"metal design is Rock Solid nice job in"
"terms of the looks and the build okay"
"folks let's check out the port selection"
"on the left side is a 3.5 millimeter"
"microphone headphone combo Jack a Micro"
"SD card reader next to that is a drop"
"jaw usba Port moving over to the right"
"side you get a second drop jaw usb-a"
"port and two USBC Thunderbolt 4 ports"
"that are full function supporting data"
"charge and display out now one little"
"nitpick is I'd like to have these two"
"USBC Thunderbolt 4 ports on opposite"
"sides of each other instead of being on"
"the same side of this convertible laptop"
"the other thing is I'd like to have HDMI"
"I understand this is a very thin and"
"light Ultra portable so space is at a"
"premium but it would have been nice to"
"have it nonetheless"
"now HP made it really easy to get inside"
"this laptop no longer do you have to"
"remove any rubber strips to get to any"
"hidden screws all you need to do is"
"remove the four T5 Torx screws and"
"that's it use a guitar pick or a pry"
"tool and pop off the bottom plate and"
"you're in I like how easy that is"
"and as far as user upgradability is"
"concerned it comes as no surprise that"
"the ram is soldered into the motherboard"
"my review unit has 16 gigabytes of RAM"
"and it is running in dual Channel mode"
"now it seems to me that 16 might be the"
"maximum you can go as I didn't see on"
"hp's website an option to go to 32 which"
"would be a little bit unfortunate but"
"again I'll look into that and report my"
"findings or whatever HP tells me but as"
"far as this unit again 16 gigabytes of"
"RAM now as far as the SSC is concerned"
"that is user upgradable my review unit"
"has one terabyte of SSD storage and as"
"you can see from these reads and writes"
"excellent speeds indicating that this is"
"a Gen 4 SSD something we like to see"
"here in 2022 good job on that front now"
"it comes to wireless this is running"
"Wi-Fi 6E along with Bluetooth 5.2 no"
"issues on either the Wi-Fi or the"
"Bluetooth and one thing to note that is"
"slotted in so you can upgrade it"
"yourself down the road that's always a"
"nice option to have it's not soldered"
"into the motherboard that's good to see"
"as well"
"now when it comes to the display there"
"are actually three options you can go"
"with a full HD Plus option that's IPS"
"1920x1200 multi-touch display that can"
"get as bright as 400 nits then the"
"mid-tier one would be the one with a"
"2560 by 1600 resolution that also can"
"get as bright as 400 nits and then"
"there's an OLED option that's the one I"
"have it's a 2.8k option 2880 by 1800 and"
"that is a low blue light filter it also"
"is at high dynamic range in terms of HDR"
"content that's going to be great and it"
"also has a brightness and standard"
"definition of 400 nits so that's the one"
"that HP sent over that's the top of the"
"line display"
"and I love the move to a 16 to 10 aspect"
"ratio you'll see a little bit more on"
"the display you'll do less scrolling"
"when it comes to web browsing that's a"
"big improvement over the 16 to 9 display"
"you got last year now something to keep"
"in mind with a 16 to 10 display you're"
"going to get slight bars on the top and"
"the bottom when you're consuming media"
"that was optimized for a 16 to 9 aspect"
"ratio so that's just something to be"
"aware of and as with any OLED display"
"you're going to get the really deep"
"blacks the super vibrant colors that"
"just pop off the display the really high"
"contrast it's all there that's why I"
"love an OLED display it just looks"
"fantastic and the fact that this is an"
"HDR display watching High dynamic range"
"content on this OLED display has it been"
"simply superb I'm absolutely loving this"
"for consuming media and it has excellent"
"coverage of the color gamut so this is"
"going to be great for the content"
"creator as well as having really good"
"color accuracy so if you're going to do"
"Lightroom Photoshop video editing in"
"color grading this panel will not"
"disappoint it is excellent for those"
"tasks now a couple of notes about the"
"display there's no 4K plus option this"
"is as high as it's going to go the 2880"
"by 1800 that's 2.8 K there's no high"
"refresh rate other than the 60 hertz you"
"don't get 120 you don't get 90 that's"
"something to be aware of that would have"
"been nice especially if you're doing"
"gaming or something like that but for"
"Content creation or you're doing things"
"like that 60 hertz will certainly"
"suffice and it'll give you better"
"battery life and it's also a glossy"
"display and you'll notice the glaring"
"Reflections it'll depend on your"
"lighting conditions something to be"
"aware of but my overall takeaway is this"
"2.8 KO LED display is simply superb and"
"if you have the money I would go with"
"this option but there is one caveat of"
"course and that means the OLED display"
"will use more power and take up more"
"battery life you'll do better on the IPS"
"versions if you're looking for more"
"longevity now this being a two-in-one"
"convertible means you can't quite open"
"it with one finger that has really tight"
"hinges by the way a big improvement over"
"the last generation you don't get a lot"
"of screen wobble either that's again a"
"big Improvement we'd like to see that"
"and of course this being a two-in-one"
"convertible means you could put this"
"into the different modes you get the"
"tent mode which is great for recipes in"
"the kitchen consuming media watching"
"Netflix Amazon and YouTube the same"
"could be said of the stand mode that's"
"be great for presentations and so forth"
"I actually really like that mode and"
"then of course you could always put it"
"into the tablet mode great for use with"
"the pen and speaking of the pen HP also"
"includes the HP tilt pen which charges"
"via USBC and stores magnetically to the"
"side as you see here and the pen is"
"great for taking notes sketching out"
"diagrams sketching out artwork it really"
"depends on what you want to do with it"
"again no takers digital artists will"
"gravitate towards the band I thought it"
"worked really well and I also love using"
"the pen in tablet mode great for"
"navigating through the OS with that pen"
"really worked well"
"this is a much improved camera over last"
"year's model this now is a five"
"megapixel camera it's got the Glam cam"
"features the auto framing the auto"
"correction the auto lighting it's got"
"all the bells and whistles that we've"
"been seeing here in 2022 HP has done a"
"great job in terms of these cameras it's"
"now an IR camera that allows you to log"
"in with face recognition with Windows"
"hello there is no longer a fingerprint"
"scanner located on the keyboard that's"
"gone so now you'll have to rely on the"
"IR camera and again it's working well"
"setup was easy now there's a dedicated"
"key on the keyboard that allows you to"
"turn off the webcam for more security"
"and privacy so that's always good I'm"
"curious to know what you think let me"
"know in the comment section below what"
"do you think about the video quality and"
"what do you think about the audio"
"quality of the array mics and for those"
"wondering this is the difference year"
"over year in terms of the webcam the one"
"on the left is a 720p webcam and it's"
"not IR the one on the right is the 2022"
"webcam 5 megapixels and it is IR so big"
"difference"
"now I'm a big fan of the NV keyboards I"
"liked it on the 15 inch version I love"
"it here on the 13 inch version I like"
"the tactility the key travels excellent"
"and I also love the fact that the keys"
"light up really nicely here easy to see"
"the differentiation and the contrast"
"between the backlight and the keys"
"especially with this blue model here I'm"
"not sure about the silver but with this"
"blue model you have no trouble"
"identifying the keys so the back lights"
"working well and it's great for typing"
"out long emails long documents very"
"comfortable your fingers never feel like"
"you're going to bottom out there so"
"that's been very good the touchpad is"
"also pretty spacious for a 13 inch"
"convertible two finger scrolling was"
"very responsive and all the gestures"
"work as you'd expect so good job on that"
"front as well all right let's talk"
"battery life and the HP Envy X360"
"13-inch Sports a 4 cell 66 watt hour"
"battery and considering this as a 2.8k"
"OLED display this did really well on the"
"battery test probably the best result"
"I've seen this year as far as an OLED"
"display is concerned and this did over"
"13 and a half hours on my continuous web"
"serving test over Wi-Fi in 150 nits what"
"does that mean in real world mixed usage"
"you're looking at anywhere between 9 to"
"10 hours depending on what you're doing"
"in terms of real world mixed usage so"
"remember everybody's use case is a"
"little bit different so your mileage may"
"vary but my overall takeaway is the"
"battery life is excellent considering"
"this as a 2.8k OLED display now if you"
"go with the IPS offerings in terms of"
"the display you'll do even better in"
"terms of battery life that's even better"
"and if you need to charge it takes a"
"little bit over an hour and a half to"
"give you a full charge with the supplied"
"65 watt USBC power adapter okay let's"
"talk performance and this Sports a"
"12-chan Intel processor it's the core i7"
"1250u a 10 core processor from Intel"
"that's eight efficiency cores into"
"performance cores and as you can see"
"from these numbers year over year and"
"nice increase over the 11th gen from"
"last year now this also Sports"
"integrated Iris XE graphics and I've"
"gone over this before I think they're"
"getting a little bit long in the tooth"
"and you could do some 1080p video"
"editing I wouldn't do 4K video editing"
"with integrated Iris XC graphics and you"
"can play some games if you lower the"
"settings I've shown it a number of times"
"here on the channel you'll get playable"
"frame rates but of course you could"
"always add an external GPU thanks to the"
"two Thunderbolt 4 ports that this has"
"and we're seeing the biggest Improvement"
"is in the multi-core performance over"
"last year's model and that's going to"
"give you the really good performance"
"here especially on the cinebench R23"
"which tests for any kind of thermal"
"throttling in a heavy sustained workload"
"it did well in that regard and for those"
"wondering what the difference is with"
"the 2021 model that's running the 11 Gen"
"processor well this is the difference"
"here and as you can see year over year a"
"big Improvement in both the single core"
"and multi-core performance when it comes"
"to the CPU and even an improvement when"
"it comes to these integrated Iris XE"
"Graphics definitely showing the"
"improvements in 2022 that's for sure and"
"when it comes to the audio this has"
"bottom firing speakers they're tuned by"
"bang Olufsen decent volume good mids"
"good bass I would say this is a pretty"
"good sound filling up a room rather"
"nicely for an ultra portable convertible"
"laptop we don't normally see that so"
"good job on that regard now to give an"
"example of the speakers let's listen to"
"epidemic sound and if you want to save"
"10 percent off epidemic sound see the"
"link in the description below"
"thank you"
"[Music]"
"okay people let's bring it on home what"
"do I think about the HP Envy X360"
"convertible 13-inch laptop here for 2022"
"big changes across the board I like the"
"move to a 16 to 10 aspect ratio and the"
"offering of a stunning 13.3 inch 2.8 K"
"OLED display you got a thin and Light"
"chassis a very Sleek design very"
"versatile design of course good Port"
"selection here excellent battery life"

"little bit surprised with that how good"
"the battery was really good IPS expect"
"even more battery that's great durable"
"Rock Solid design as I mentioned pcie"
"Gen 4 SSD storage the speeds were very"
"good full HD webcam is a nice"
"improvement over last year 1080p video"
"that's been great the microphone sounds"
"great hp's done a really good job with"
"their microphones and and cameras here"
"in 2022 and I like the good audio coming"
"out of the speakers now the negatives of"
"course you get soldered RAM and the blue"
"color which I think is absolutely"
"gorgeous is also a major fingerprint"
"magnet you will be wiping it down quite"
"a bit but I think hp's hit a home run"
"here with big changes pretty much across"
"the board that's why I'm going to give"
"it my editor's choice for the 13-inch"
"convertible laptop category here for"
"2022 making it worth your money"
"so what do you think about this bad boy"
"the nvx360 this gorgeous blue by the way"
"I'm really liking it but one thing to be"
"aware of it is a major fingerprint"
"magnet you probably notice it here on"
"the video uh really thin and light nice"
"all metal design very premium very"
"high-end nice Port selection on this no"
"complaints on that front uh really great"
"display here 2.8 K OLED display 13.3"
"inches it's a 16 to 10 aspect ratio 2880"
"by 1800 all the Hallmarks of the OLED"
"display are here the Deep blacks the"
"vibrant colors the high contrast it's"
"all there nice that they include the pen"
"with this model it's the HP rechargeable"
"tilt pen the charges via USBC sticks"
"magnetically to the side and that's a"
"nice value add right there for those"
"that want to sketch out diagrams take"
"some notes artwork you know you get the"
"idea now as far as the battery life"
"something I wasn't expecting on this"
"with an OLED display over 13 and a half"
"hours on my continuous web serving test"
"that's about 9-10 hours maybe 11 hours"
"depending on what you're doing on real"
"world mixed usage so this is something"
"we haven't seen before good battery life"
"with an OLED display so this might hit"
"the perfect combination there now of"
"course you want even more battery life I"
"would imagine the IPS offerings the"
"other two uh would really come to play"
"there would really give you some good"
"results but very satisfied with this one"
"and for the price considering you're"
"getting an OLED display you're getting"
"the great battery life and the good"
"performance really double the"
"performance multi-core year over year"
"this is a great value again thirteen"

"this is Andrew from AMD Tech"
"see ya"
"they call it the hp envy x360 the"
"benchmarks are in"
"the thoughts have been noted on the"
"build quality and performance"
"let's get right into this review this is"
"the ryzen 7 5700u model with integrated"
"graphics"
"now because of that i was slightly"
"disappointed by some"
"of the performance specs be it anything"
"that requires heavy rendering so"
"right off the bat if you're looking for"
"this computer for 3d modeling i would"
"not go for it i would immediately push"
"you towards something like"
"the hp omen which has a good strong"
"powerful dedicated gpu and once that"
"review comes out you can check it out in"
"the youtube cards above but right off"
"the bat let's jump right into the build"
"quality"
"first and foremost i love the new softer"
"edges"
"they are so smooth and as you can see"
"from last year's model"
"the rounded edges don't catch your"
"fingers as much and just make for a more"
"comfortable laptop to handle"
"while we have this thing up on its side"
"let's take a look at the ports comes"
"with the usb"
"type a hdmi usb type-c which is not"
"thunderbolt 3 headphone jack and on the"
"other side we have"
"a sd card slot usb type a and the"
"ac power adapter now do note that you"
"can charge the laptop"
"using the usbc i do not have a usb"
"type-c"
"charger so unfortunately i did not test"
"that but it charges very quickly"
"with the ac power adapter and has a"
"fantastic battery life"
"while web browsing and doing"
"productivity tasks as well as good"
"battery life while streaming video"
"on youtube now for 4k video editing"
"and photoshop it doesn't have the most"
"amazing battery life"
"but better than most laptops i've"
"reviewed on my channel so for creative"
"tasks i recommend bringing that charger"
"along with you"
"as it will not last all day all aluminum"
"on the top cover"
"bottom cover side panels and keyboard"
"deck there's a little bit of give"
"on the top cover but not a lot now when"
"you open"
"the laptop you're going to have to use"
"two hands because if you don't"
"well that's going to happen so"
"definitely two hands is important now"
"one thing i want to point out though"
"you saw the screen flex but this is"
"pretty awesome this"
"laptop has the least amount of"
"screen flex as far as this motion that"
"i've ever seen it's such a firm and"
"solid screen"
"however it does bounce a little bit as"
"you can see there but it does not bounce"
"when you're typing so as i'm typing"
"the screen stays nice and still and of"
"course this is a convertible laptop"
"so you can do that and use it as a"
"little presentation thing or touch"
"screen whatever you might want to do"
"okay the next thing to consider is the"
"press along"
"the top here also good press in the"
"middle"
"not a big deal this laptop like i said"
"for the all-aluminum chassis"
"is fantastic firm strong a lot of times"
"you'll get a hold of a aluminum laptop"
"you're like man it just"
"it feels so cheap so thin and chintzy"
"this laptop does not feel thin and"
"chintzy"
"in my opinion so one thing i wanted to"
"correct about my unboxing is i said that"
"the top"
"vents were actually speakers and this is"
"incorrect the speakers are right here"
"on the bottom cover"
"[Music]"
"[Applause]"
"but they should be vents right but"
"unfortunately when you turn the computer"
"over and you take it apart"
"they're not really venting to anything"
"the fans are in the middle"
"which makes sense because the main vent"
"on the bottom cover is in the middle"
"but where are these top grilles venting"
"are they pulling air in are they"
"pushing air out it's it looks to me as"
"if they are"
"more for show than anything the other"
"available model of the hp envy x360 has"
"the vent"
"along the bottom of the screen so the"
"top of the keyboard deck which makes"
"sense"
"because this right here would be the top"
"of the keyboard deck"
"so that vent would actually be useful in"
"pulling air in or pushing"
"air out of the chassis the vents along"
"the side"
"don't really make sense so this model"
"runs substantially cooler"
"than this model and because of that your"
"only main vent is"
"actually right here along the back panel"
"of the chassis"
"which is why we're seeing quite poor"
"thermals"
"on this laptop this year i was very"
"disappointed by the thermals to be"
"totally honest it got"
"up to 95 degrees celsius during the 4k"
"export"
"during the photoshop benchmarks it ran"
"warm i would definitely recommend if"
"you're somebody who wants a"
"cool laptop to go with the model that"
"has the vent"
"along the top of the keyboard deck"
"because this vent"
"actually vents your laptop because the"
"fans are right here in the middle"
"okay so very important to consider"
"moving down to the keyboard deck it is"
"fantastic it's very reminiscent of the"
"hp"
"omen and if you've watched my channel"
"for a long time you know i'm a very big"
"fan boy"
"i like this simplified layout there is"
"no numpad which is great for creators it"
"just kind of gets in the way"
"but you also have your toggle switches"
"and you do have fingerprint sign in so"
"you can sign in with your fingerprint"
"now there is a button cutoff switch for"
"the webcam but there is not"
"a technically manual switch to cover it"
"so you just kind of have to trust that"
"it actually is turned off here is the"
"webcam test as you can tell it kind of"
"changes"
"colors but it has pretty good visuals"
"overall it'll be decent for you know"
"your average video conferencing"
"and also you can hear the audio here as"
"well the trackpad is good"
"it's not great only for the mere reason"
"that's a little bit loud"
"19 bigger than last year which is a big"
"upgrade"
"so this laptop continues to be made more"
"and more with a creator focus"
"in mind the screen is also a big upgrade"
"for creators this year you can get a 99"
"srgb screen that's a slight upgrade in"
"price but still for under a thousand"
"dollars with that upgrade"
"this laptop really shows off there's not"
"a lot of laptops"
"especially thin and light ones that are"
"under a thousand dollars that can get"
"that high of color gamut range"
"as mentioned in the intro this is the"
"ryzen 7 5700u model"
"with an upgrade to 16 gigs of ram which"
"in my opinion"
"is almost perfect for photoshop as you"
"see it really hits kind of the best bang"
"for buck"
"right around the 630 points range inside"
"of puget systems if you upgrade to 32"
"gigs"
"you're only going to get about a 60"
"point increase if you upgrade to 64 gigs"
"you're only gonna get about a hundred"
"point increase so really this is"
"optimized for creators in my opinion at"
"16 gigs of ram"
"which is great for the old budget if you"
"want more in-depth specs like running"
"the fan modes different ram"
"configurations for photo editing and"
"video editing"
"then definitely check out my dedicated"
"reviews for each of those types of use"
"case"
"jumping into the simulated benchmarks"
"this laptop really stands out even"
"amongst some of the big boys with the"
"high performance processors"
"and dedicated gpus checking out"
"cinebench r20"
"cinebench r23 and geekbench"
"single core and multi-core you can see"
"that it's really stepping it up and this"
"is not just"
"fanboy press like this laptop really"
"does"
"pack a punch hey there man why don't you"
"gently stroke that like button"
"helps us out a lot on this channel gets"
"more views to my beautiful chassis"
"appreciate it as i mentioned earlier if"
"you're thinking about after effects for"
"this laptop it's doable but because of"
"the lack of the dedicated gpu"
"the render scores were very low so"
"although it scores a decent after"
"effects score i would not recommend it"
"for that use case"
"now is this a 4k or 1080p video editing"
"laptop in my opinion 1080p is really the"
"sweet spot you're gonna have faster"
"export times"
"and much smoother playback but if you"
"really want to use it for 4k"
"know that at full quality playback in"
"premiere pro you're going to drop about"
"10"
"850 frames out of 16 177"
"but if you drop it down to half quality"
"for your you know playback timeline"
"you're gonna only drop 792. so if you do"
"it"
"your playback at half quality or fourth"
"quality could actually be"
"in good hands however the export time is"
"a little long at seven minutes"
"versus 1080p at about a minute 34."
"so the playback at 1080p is also"
"substantially better"
"at full quality you'll actually only"
"drop 236"
"frames with the 16 gigs of ram installed"
"so that's why i lean it more towards a"
"1080p video editing laptop versus 4k"
"for davinci resolve you're going to have"
"smooth playback it's far more optimized"
"for ryzen and you're going to have"
"pretty solid export times as well"
"with excellent performance paired with"
"great build quality and a color accurate"
"screen this laptop really packs a punch"
"for creative professionals"
"links if you're ready to make a purchase"
"likes if this video has brought you some"
"value"
"and subs if you don't miss out on the"
"future uploads i'll see you in the next"
"one"
"what's up everybody this is Danny and"
"today I've partnered with HP to share"
"with you my experience of the 15 inch"
"envy x-360 laptop this is a two-in-one"
"convertible perfect for business and"
"everyday use it's available in a ton of"
"different configurations and starts"
"under $600 but you never know when sales"
"happen so make sure you hit that link"
"down below to check current pricing and"
"configuration options let's start with"
"the build of the 15-inch Envy x-360"
"laptop it's a nice metal build it feels"
"really solid it's easy to open with one"
"finger so that's always welcome due to"
"its larger size it's a little heavier at"
"slightly under 5 pounds but I've had no"
"problem putting it in my backpack so"
"even for students it's definitely"
"portable the hinges are solid on this"
"laptop"
"I love the design touches on the back"
"the best thing about the two-in-one form"
"factor is that you can use it like a"
"regular laptop then you can tint it to"
"watch movies and catch up on your"
"favorite content or you can just lay it"
"flat and use it like a tablet so the"
"flexibility is awesome especially if you"
"get the compatible pen I love that this"
"is a full HD touchscreen IPS display it"
"looks nice in laptop mode there is some"
"wobble when you touch the screen so if"
"you want the best touchscreen experience"
"I would suggest a tent mode or using it"
"in tablet mode it's not a deal-breaker"
"whatsoever I don't use the touchscreen"
"that much but when I do I did notice it"
"the display is brighter than a 13-inch"
"envy that I've reviewed earlier this"
"year so that's nice to see but you still"
"might have a problem seeing the screen"
"outside with the laptop due to the"
"glossy display and the overall"
"brightness but if you're primarily using"
"this inside at the office or at coffee"
"shops it definitely does the job I"
"watched a few movies on this laptop and"
"it looks good for the price point and"
"it's nice to have a larger 15 inch"
"display and since its IPs you do get"
"better viewing angles if you like"
"watching content on your laptop you'll"
"be happy with these speakers tuned by"
"Bang & Olufsen they are loud they sound"
"crisp nice and clear highs and mids I"
"wish it was a little bit more rounded"
"with some more bass but I think you're"
"gonna be really happy with the speakers"
"on the 15-inch"
"X 360 when it comes to ports you get a"
"nice selection on the left side you get"
"a DC in for charging I do love how HP"
"has slimmed down the power brick is a 65"
"watt charger but it's nice and portable"
"which"
"like get a USB 3.1 port a power button"
"ventilation grille and a headphone jack"
"and also a full-size SD card slot which"
"is awesome for content creators on the"
"right side you get an HDMI port another"
"USB 3.1 port a USB C port which is"
"awesome and yes you can charge the"
"laptop with the USB C port and with the"
"USB a and USB C port from that side you"
"can charge other devices such as laptops"
"and phones there's also a fingerprint"
"scanner on this model that I have so you"
"can securely login it does take getting"
"some used to with the positioning but it"
"works perfectly fine and there's also a"
"volume rocker there and on some models"
"you might see a webcam kill switch which"
"is a cool option for privacy the"
"keyboard layout includes the number pad"
"on the right side this is great for"
"business professionals that need this or"
"if you just prefer to have it there the"
"keyboard is nice and comfortable with"
"soft keys and lots of travel it's a"
"little too soft for my preference but"
"it's a comfortable keyboard the trackpad"
"is fairly responsive scrolling works"
"well for everyday use I do wish it was a"
"tad larger and wider but I think a lot"
"of people will be happy with this"
"trackpad there are plenty of power"
"options for the X 360 lineup you can go"
"all the way up to the 10th generation"
"Intel processors they are AMD rising"
"options as well and you can get"
"dedicated graphics up to the MX 250 so"
"you're gonna have to take a look and see"
"which configuration works best for you"
"the back is removable with some screws"
"that are hidden behind these rubber"
"bumpers but I wouldn't because most"
"things are not upgradable like Ram but"
"in terms of performance I can only talk"
"about the model that I have and this is"
"configured with the Intel quad core i7"
"85 65 u processor with 8 gigabytes of"
"RAM and a 256 gigabyte m2 SSD which has"
"nice speed by the way so opening"
"applications and overall performance is"
"nice everyday use like web browsing or"
"normal computing it's no problem so"
"office suite will work perfectly on here"
"this is not meant for gaming but you can"
"also casually game on the Intel 620"
"integrated graphics flight titles like"
"overwatch play surprisingly well on this"
"laptop but don't expect it to play"
"anything demanding in my testing with"
"everyday use the laptop has stayed very"
"cool so heat management is"
"good on this when you do play games the"
"fans do ramp up it does get a little bit"
"warm but I've never had it to the point"
"where it gets too warm to put on my lap"
"or anything like that I haven't done a"
"lot of demanding things like video"
"editing on here because honestly for the"
"type of work you'll need to bump up to a"
"better GPU but if you want to do some"
"photo editing or Photoshop or Lightroom"
"on this it's definitely doable on this"
"laptop so let's round this out with"
"battery life the 15-inch Envy x-360 has"
"a 56 watt hour battery and it's rated up"
"to 10 hours but I was getting between 5"
"to 7 hours of usage on mixed usage it"
"depends on what I had to display at so"
"if I kept the display at between 60 and"
"70% I was able to get about 6 hours of"
"usage but the good thing is the laptop"
"charges very fast what that included"
"charger so you'll be happy with that"
"so if you're looking for an affordable"
"two-in-one and you want that larger"
"15-inch display the HP x360 lineup could"
"be a good fit make sure you check that"
"link below because certain"
"configurations make this a really good"
"deal especially for the performance that"
"you're getting for that price so make"
"sure you scroll through and see if it"
"makes sense for you and then pick one up"
"if it does let me know what you think"
"about this laptop and let me know which"
"other laptops that you may take a look"
"at next and I will see you in the next"
"one"
"his is Lisa from mobile tech review and"
"this is the HP Envy x-360 13-inch are"
"the 13 z model specifically HP has been"
"been doing great things with the envy"
"and it gets even better in part because"
"we have the new AMD rise in 4000 series"
"CPU inside otherwise known as n2 or"
"renoir r very fast"
"excellent performance there and keeps"
"the price reasonable but beyond that"
"they've done a redesign just like they"
"did with the spectre x360 last year so"
"this distance over here is over 17"
"millimeters shorter and it reduces the"
"bottom chin bezel that used to be kind"
"of large beyond that you've got a metal"
"casing they call this nightfall black"
"all aluminum casing nice full HD display"
"options we're gonna look at it now but"
"now a shout-out to our sponsor Trend"
"Micro and their home network security"
"device this is just a little over $100"
"and it's really easy to set up just plug"
"in the included Ethernet cable into your"
"router plug it into power and it does"
"more than just firewall you know it is a"
"firewall - it protects your Internet of"
"Things device and so that means all the"
"smart devices that you have your ring"
"doorbells your alexa this and that your"
"robotic vacuum cleaner all that stuff"
"it's gonna protect it it's gonna make"
"sure that nobody tries to hack in also"
"it has parental control so this is great"
"for family management especially with"
"kids being at home so much right now"
"you can check to make sure they're not"
"using apps that they shouldn't be using"
"and also can set timers so basically in"
"10 o'clock at night no more YouTube for"
"you you get the idea there and it also"
"blocks malicious files and malicious"
"websites to some and again very easy to"
"manage Android Apple smartphone it"
"doesn't matter both of those are gonna"
"work just fine and there's another bonus"
"it also protects your router which is"
"pretty good because your ISP throws a"
"router at you and never updates it again"
"now back to our video so this is one"
"heck of a tiny 13.3 inch ultra buck I"
"tell you HP and Dell are just in a"
"battle at the XPS line you know versus"
"the envy and the specter has to who can"
"make the smallest one they say it's the"
"footprint of your old school 11 inch"
"laptop and they're not lying it looks"
"tiny it's also very attractive-looking"
"given the price tag that's pretty darn"
"nice"
"you get an aluminum casing here and one"
"nice black and you get a full HD IPS"
"display that's the only display option"
"and that's fair because our model nicely"
"equipped it's got the rise in five"
"inside and it's got eight gigs of RAM"
"and 256 gig SSD is selling for around"
"seven hundred and sixty nine dollars and"
"it looks very premium so good that now"
"if you want to spend even less there is"
"a risin three and rise ins kind of"
"trying to parallel Intel Core i3 i5 and"
"i7 with their nomenclature and that one"
"is eight gigs ram an old 128 gig SSD I"
"would GOG to the rise in five if you can"
"afford it it's not too much of a big"
"jump in price you could go up to a risin"
"7 16 gigs of ram is the max and you can"
"even go up to a one terabyte SSD if you"
"want i'm regardless of which one you're"
"gonna get it to nvme SSD with reasonable"
"good speed so that's a lot of niceness"
"for the price here so HP is really got"
"almost threatening their own spectre"
"x360 line here because you're getting"
"the metal chassis and all that sort of"
"thing but for those who want some of the"
"added niceties like a 4k display for"
"example or Thunderbolt 3 then the"
"spectre is still there for you not to"
"mention that edgy design which is pretty"
"cool-looking on him so the spice"
"supports pen and touch the pen is not in"
"the box here it's Microsoft pin protocol"
"2.0 otherwise known as entry seeing it"
"HP's pen these days are selling one"
"that's USB C rechargeable you could use"
"a Microsoft Surface pro pendant as well"
"with it if you wanted to they build this"
"more for note-taking and that's"
"appropriate and trig is little less"
"smooth when it comes to things like"
"diagonal line jitter and all that stuff"
"that artists care about it's fine for"
"note-taking in the palm rejection it's"
"pretty good these days"
"obviously there are 360 degree hinges"
"here because this is a convertible ultra"
"book and for those of you who like all"
"this but want a 15-inch laptop they"
"actually make it in the 15-inch size to"
"in similar specs and similar pricing"
"some other niceties are webcam privacy"
"switch there's a fingerprint scanner in"
"the keyboard the power button is right"
"next to the Delete key on the keyboard"
"that to me is not the most brilliant"
"decision but hey and they have a quick"
"launch button for the HP command center"
"which I mostly use for the thermal"
"profiles there's their version of"
"optimizer balance"
"as a high-performance mode which in our"
"test didn't make actually that much of a"
"difference and a couple of super quiet"
"kind of settings now the the start here"
"is going to be this year's a.m. the rise"
"in 4000 series CPU so we have the rise"
"in used series ultrabook 15 watt CPUs"
"with AMD Radeon Vega 8 graphics which"
"are about like Intel iris + graphic g7"
"graphics so you don't have to go for the"
"highest end core i7 and Intel and just"
"to get that kind of similar graphics"
"performance here for less money nice"
"then we have the risin 5 4500 you and"
"this is a good performer at benchmarks"
"closer to an Intel Core i7 10th chin"
"very nice and the other good thing about"
"the Rison is that the performance in"
"terms of thermals the heat and the"
"battery life are also excellent which is"
"new for rise in CPUs for this generation"
"finally they got there and they did a"
"good job of it some went running"
"benchmarks and doing more demanding"
"tasks like handbrake video and codes and"
"all that sort of thing CPU temperatures"
"typically maxed out around 85 centigrade"
"whereas Intel we'd see more like 95"
"centigrade so that's good the cooling"
"here is not quite as effective as it is"
"on the Lenovo IdeaPad flex 15 with the"
"same CPU but that's a 14-inch chassis"
"bigger laptop a little more room for"
"cooling and I wouldn't make my buying"
"decision on that because this one's"
"still running cool enough you improve"
"thermals here versus Intel also mean"
"you're gonna hear the fan a lot less"
"often if you push it hard you'll hear it"
"ultra book fan you know that Shh"
"not a roaring or anything like that I"
"don't think most people would be"
"bothered by it it is thin it is metal I"
"didn't find that he got hot to the touch"
"though the u series CPUs are 50 watt"
"they're not the super powerful mobile"
"workstation style CPU so I didn't find"
"any burning hot spots on the laptop even"
"when doing things like benchmarking so"
"good then in terms of ports you've got"
"USB 8 points you've got your micro SD"
"card slot skinny laptop here in the USBA"
"ports or what they call drop jog little"
"drop-down hinges on them because it's"
"too thin to just put the USB a port"
"without doing them and we have USB C and"
"that is Gen 2 and supports DisplayPort"
"and it supports power delivery though"
"this comes with a barrel pin charging"
"including"
"USBC charger if you wanted so no"
"Thunderbolt 3 here in part because"
"Thunderbolt 3 was Intel's intellectual"
"property now it's opening up in the"
"future we'll probably see what they AMD"
"but given the price you don't expect to"
"see Thunderbolt 3 and something that's"
"selling for 650 or 769 dollars you can"
"use USB C docks so that's a go in terms"
"of display no matter what you go with"
"here they have three options you're"
"still gonna get full HD IPS and there's"
"gonna support the pen and touch now they"
"have a 300 in which we haven't seen in"
"person the 400 nits which is the one"
"that we have which really goes way over"
"400 nits it's nice to see this happening"
"with manufacturers exceeding their"
"claims and there's also a 1000 that"
"privacy display which we've seen on the"
"HP Spectre series it's mostly very"
"bright to deal with the privacy screen"
"functionality on its own yeah"
"it's a good despite honestly here we"
"have full srgb coverage which is nice to"
"see and we have better than average"
"contrast ratio you can see the specs on"
"screen it's reasonably well calibrated"
"from the factory - it's a pleasure than"
"of screen and it's and color accurate"
"enough screen that it's enjoyable as"
"ever with HP laptop cell boy is a"
"glossing plenty of reflection and glare"
"the keyboard on this is backlit and"
"white you know two levels of"
"backlighting and it doesn't have a lot"
"of travel it's a super skinny laptop"
"it's okay though the tactile feel on"
"this is pretty good and as we all get"
"adjusted to these lower travel keyboards"
"it's fine it's not weird of short travel"
"just average short travel keyboard we"
"have a Microsoft precision trackpad on"
"board it behaves perfectly well it's a"
"slightly rough service you can actually"
"hear your finger going across it like a"
"little cheat I like that it gives you"
"traction so you're not like skating"
"across the track Ben works fine no"
"stereo banging olsen brand and speakers"
"here with HP's software to amp up the"
"sound and given how tiny this thing it"
"is it actually has some bass which is"
"impressive and plenty of volume on board"
"this is a 51 watt hour battery which is"
"a good sized capacity battery here and"
"it comes with a 65 watt fast charger"
"that can charge it up to 50% in 30"
"minutes"
"again it's the barrel pin kind of"
"connector you could use USB charger if"
"you wanted to"
"HP claims I'm almost 12 hours for"
"Netflix streaming in almost 13 hours for"
"web browsing and that's what the"
"brightness set to 150 minutes and as"
"always a little optimistic there and"
"with web browsing and they mean edge and"
"on Chrome which is more resource"
"intensive they mean and a few tabs open"
"and not 25 tabs open in your web browser"
"but I found on average that we were"
"managing 9 to 10 hours with a charge"
"that's really good Rison is really"
"leading the way here with some reduced"
"power consumption and good performance"
"so what about this versus the ideal"
"anova IdeaPad flex 15 or so lenovo is a"
"40 inch laptop versus this being a 13.3"
"inch so in part that does depend on your"
"preferred screen size not that there's a"
"huge huge difference both at full HD"
"displays both have the same rise in CPU"
"options but the display on the HP is"
"much better much wider color damage full"
"srgb versus only 65% of srgb also higher"
"contrast so that stands in this favor"
"I like the Lenovo keyboard feel a little"
"bit better but I like the looks at the"
"end me better in the fact that it has an"
"aluminum casing on it whereas lenovo's"
"it's plastic so this one just feels more"
"classy and looks a little prettier to my"
"eye not that looks for everything but"
"they influenced us all now here's"
"something that I always consider a"
"negative with HP's consumer laptops the"
"skinny ones like the spectre x360 and"
"this envy they call them not user"
"serviceable what that really means is"
"you have to pull off the rubber strips"
"on the bottom and the adhesive is kind"
"of cranky you might not get it back on"
"there again to access the screws that"
"hold the bottom plate on I'm not gonna"
"bother opening this one out mostly"
"because like all ultrabooks the RAM is"
"soldered on the only thing you can"
"replace is the m2 SSD if you want to put"
"a bigger one in or a faster one in and"
"the Wi-Fi card is socketed but since"
"it's an intel Wi-Fi 6 8 X 200 card which"
"is a very good car do you probably are"
"not going to want to replace that so"
"that's the HP Envy x-360 13-inch model"
"with AMD inside it's hard to find"
"anything to complain about given the"
"price in this latch I began a metal"
"chassis you get quite a pleasing IPS"
"display here at least with our 400 nits"
"model haven't seen the 300 in person to"
"set a good decent keyboard on a very"
"nice trackpad performance that's"
"excellent"
"design that's very yummy yes you don't"
"get thunder both free and in part that"
"has to do with AMD but really mostly it"
"has to do with the price if you want"
"thunderbolt three there's the next jump"
"up which is the spectre x360 of their"
"most premium model very nice overall"
"I'll miss it for mobile tech review be"
"sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel"
"for more cool tech videos and thumbs up"
"if you like this man"
"one of the many benefits of having your"
"own youtube channel is the unique"
"ability to be able to review many"
"products and because our channel is a"
"technology channel we were lucky enough"
"to get our hands on an hp mv x360 201"
"laptop and we're super excited to open"
"this up and take a look at the laptop"
"i'm going to give you a few of the main"
"specs for this particular laptop this hp"
"laptop runs on the amd ryzen 7. it has"
"12 gigs of ddr4 ram it comes with a 512"
"gig solid-state hard drive and this"
"model does not come with an optical"
"drive but the upside this model is"
"pre-loaded with windows 11. this model"
"is a 15.6 full hd led touchscreen and"
"this laptop comes with bang olufsen"
"speakers so it should sound good and"
"lastly this has a fingerprint reader to"
"unlock the laptop so enough chit chat"
"let's get this thing out of the box and"
"test it"
"and here's the laptop fresh out of the"
"box"
"and the retail price for this laptop was"
"749 at costco as of february 2022"
"and the first time you start up your new"
"laptop you'll most likely have to update"
"it and then connect your microsoft"
"account and then you can start"
"customizing your windows home screen"
"first thing i want to show you is the"
"bezel"
"i love this bezel on the side here i"
"love this how thin it is i do wish it"
"would look like that all the way around"
