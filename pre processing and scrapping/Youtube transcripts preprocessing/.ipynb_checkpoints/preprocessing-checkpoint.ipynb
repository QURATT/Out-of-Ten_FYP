       "'\"hello guys and welcome to my channel my\"\"name is Jesper fussing and today we are\"\"going to look at a sunscreen and we\\'re\"\"going to do at one of these those tinted\"\"ones and what you would like to know is\"\"how does it actually look color wise\"\"so we\\'re firstly the one we are talking\"\"about today is the one from Bioderma and\"\"it looks like this and the embellish\"\"looks like this or the packaging looks\"\"like this and first of all yes you would\"\"like to know what is the SPF and that is\"\"a 50 a plus on this one here and it says\"\"that it has the UVA in a circle and\"\"actually it was so difficult to see it I\"\"couldn\\'t really find it on the tube\"\"itself but when I looked at the\"\"packaging I could see that down here it\"\"says that it has the UVA in a circle so\"\"that means that it is at least a 1/3 UVA\"\"compared to the UVB so compared to the\"\"SPF now one other thing is that normally\"\"I like to use well that\\'s not quite true\"\"because the one I use does not have any\"\"star ratings on it and that is the one\"\"from La Roche Posay dia on tinted\"\"version but it is a good idea if you can\"\"find something with this star rating on\"\"it and if you have at least a 4 to 5\"\"stars and that is something I would use\"\"if I went to the beach or if I knew I\"\"had to be out in the Sun for a long time\"\"but just for daily use I use the one\"\"from La Roche Posay which is with a UV\"\"in a circle but it doesn\\'t have any a\"\"star rating now this one here has the UV\"\"inner circle but I know star rating so\"\"we can\\'t really talk about that and what\"\"you would like to know is how is the\"\"color well if you look at how are they\"\"making the colours in this sort of\"\"products then when they have attended\"\"version and the LA roche-posay us that\"\"had a has a tinted version and the\"\"Bioderma has a tinted aversion and other\"\"companies has tinted versions as well\"\"but for those three that i mentioned\"\"they are using\"\"something called iron oxides and they\"\"are using a yellow oxide a red and a\"\"black oxide and then they are using it\"\"to tenem oxide as well the titanium\"\"oxide is what will give you the sun\"\"protection or what would be the sun\"\"screen itself but this one here has a\"\"chemical filters in it as well as the\"\"event one is a purely a mineral\"\"sunscreen so why do I mention the\"\"titanium oxide well I do that because it\"\"is very white and that is obviously\"\"something that they are also using in\"\"order to lighten the color of a product\"\"so it\\'s not so dark also it comes up to\"\"the color that they wanted because when\"\"I just said so is not so dark well the\"\"whole thing about these tinted\"\"moisturizers hood tinted sunscreen as\"\"these ones are is that it it\\'s almost\"\"sort of like one color is supposed to\"\"fit all and I think we all know that one\"\"color certainly does not fit all\"\"so for sunscreens that I attended it\"\"should be just like for makeup so for\"\"foundations and a lot of companies are\"\"really good at that now and some\"\"companies are not that good and I would\"\"say that if you are still making a\"\"sunscreen which is a one color fits or\"\"maybe you have not really understood the\"\"message so we are reviewing this one\"\"anyway so what I would say about the\"\"iron oxide is that the difference is\"\"that in this one here and the one from\"\"even then the first ingredients of the\"\"oxides so as they are listed in the\"\"ingredients list is the yellow oxide and\"\"that means yellow iron oxide and that\"\"means of course that that product is a\"\"little bit more oranjee whereas the one\"\"from the hospice aid that is so that the\"\"red iron oxide is listed first so there\"\"is more red iron oxide in the one from a\"\"large person and there are in the ones\"\"from oven and from a higher term\"\"and that you can already think gives a\"\"sort of a difference in how the color is\"\"is more red or is it more orange II and\"\"then they also have a black iron oxide\"\"in it in order to make it more well\"\"darker so it is obviously the mix about\"\"for those iron oxide that are making up\"\"at a color so kind of like if you are\"\"looking at a product you can read from\"\"an ingredients list if they have the\"\"yellow iron oxide listed above the red\"\"iron oxide then it is more to the orange\"\"side and vice versa it would be more red\"\"and I would say that the brown from LA\"\"roche-posay is a it is red it is not\"\"orange II I would say it it comes across\"\"as being too red so yes should we try\"\"this one here and as I always say just\"\"take something out and this one you can\"\"sign it\\'s a big liquidy so it\\'s not\"\"kinda like super fatty it\\'s more like\"\"liquidy and I think they are actually\"\"saying that it is now it says in French\"\"maybe it says an image and it says aqua\"\"fluid tante tres odor protection\"\"protection is it Spanish as French I\"\"don\\'t really do French I just try my\"\"best but it tended aqua fluid very high\"\"air protection that\\'s the English\"\"version for you that so sell it our bio\"\"protection I mean what you like to know\"\"is the color so let\\'s have a look so you\"\"can just see it is kind of like really\"\"liquidy so kinda like Crips out of there\"\"this one here and it really looks like\"\"well something it looks like a makeup\"\"cream very good makeup cream and it\"\"maybe if you can see the color compared\"\"to my skin my skin is definitely not a\"\"tent at the moment because I am\"\"basically staying indoors due to the\"\"situation that we are all in so I don\\'t\"\"have that much Sun and also means that I\"\"actually not used a sunscreen for a long\"\"time because I am basically indoors\"\"every day so how does it look it\\'s very\"\"very liquid is very easy to distribute\"\"so it has this sort of a column but what\"\"our lightest show is that a lot of\"\"people they are using so little\"\"sunscreen so where this one here has the\"\"same weight as the one from the wash per\"\"se and when I use the one from the\"\"hospice a I know I need to use half a\"\"teaspoon of the teaspoons that I have\"\"your teaspoon might look a different\"\"might be small that might be bigger so I\"\"just have measured and you can see a\"\"video about that up there I will link to\"\"that one how to find out how much\"\"sunscreen to actually use so that for me\"\"would be kind of like half a of these\"\"teaspoons here so now you can maybe\"\"already see that them if I maybe can\"\"tilt it is very liquid about trying it a\"\"little bit you can maybe see how it\"\"looks how much it is and that is for my\"\"entire face and when I put it into my\"\"hand I have to remember that a lot of\"\"the cream will stick in my hand so\"\"basically it is better just to dip my\"\"finger in and then go along and then do\"\"it like that\"\"now I\\'m only doing one side I only have\"\"to use half of the amount but you can\"\"already see it gives kind of a big\"\"splash so this will just go on here and\"\"you can see that it will definitely\"\"change the color of my face so you will\"\"see that this side by its on and this I\"\"don\\'t have anything on today I only have\"\"a summer setting powder on I don\\'t have\"\"any foundation on or something like that\"\"so it is just sitting about a little bit\"\"of a highlight not to look at too tall\"\"on camera so this is a kind of like how\"\"it will look and yes I can smear it out\"\"and smeared out and smeared and continue\"\"to smear it out and a lot of it will be\"\"taken up by my hands but that was not\"\"the point the point was that I need to\"\"leave it on the skin because it\"\"is there for a certain purpose and that\"\"is in order to protect me from the Sun\"\"so when as you can see this is rather a\"\"lot of stuff to put on and just put it\"\"on my forehead so it is I mean one thing\"\"to say is that it is very easy to\"\"distribute it really easy to distribute\"\"it\\'s very liquidy and so on I don\\'t we\"\"don\\'t want Maya to put this so I put it\"\"there so don\\'t want to have it all over\"\"the place but yeah how do I think the\"\"color is when I see it directly and not\"\"through the camera where I know that the\"\"color would be a little bit different\"\"but I would say it definitely is not as\"\"orangie or it\\'s not as red as the LA\"\"roche-posay one so and it\\'s not as when\"\"I spoke about the event mineral one I\"\"compared it to a chocolate ice cream\"\"that I had as a child and which was kind\"\"of like um can I get grayish undertone\"\"into the brown where I would definitely\"\"not say that\"\"this is like that so I would say this is\"\"maybe color wise if you can maybe still\"\"see it this is kind of like I\\'m\"\"something in-between the one from our\"\"then and the one from LA roche-posay but\"\"um yeah I mean the other thing to\"\"remember about these things here is that\"\"they will actually act a little bit like\"\"a foundation and when you are putting\"\"foundation on you will use a setting\"\"spray or you can use a setting powder\"\"afterwards and I would say that that is\"\"exactly the same that you need to do\"\"when using something like this because\"\"what happens is that I had it on my face\"\"for several hours at the other day and\"\"what very quickly happened was that it\"\"started to run into the crease lines\"\"around lines you get around the nose\"\"when you\\'re moving your face so it very\"\"quickly went in there and I mean on\"\"camera it would have looked nice but in\"\"reality when people looked up close they\"\"would be able to see that it all seeped\"\"into all the\"\"lines in one\\'s face all the Mickey lines\"\"that you get did it I know in my eyes\"\"well not to begin with it took a little\"\"while I would say it took maybe a couple\"\"of hours and I did actually put it on\"\"very liberal on my eyelids and it did as\"\"in other lines on the face in the\"\"creased line on the eyelid it it very\"\"soon just ended up being a read a line\"\"as their so yes again that you wouldn\\'t\"\"have needed to use some sort of a\"\"setting powder in order to keep it a\"\"fixed so we didn\\'t or my eyes yes it did\"\"annoy my eyes after a couple of hours\"\"and I felt I just needed to take it away\"\"and in order I thought maybe it\\'s just\"\"because my eyes are limpid dry or\"\"whatever but then as soon as I took it\"\"off and it was in the evening when I\"\"took it off so it was not like okay it\"\"has been a long day\"\"my eyes are tired and so on because as\"\"soon as I took it off and I don\\'t\"\"normally have it like that when I don\\'t\"\"have a sunscreen so I immediately I took\"\"it off and I didn\\'t have that annoying\"\"feeling any longer\"\"so clearly it was the sunscreen that\"\"annoyed my eyes and I would say with the\"\"LA roche-posay one I used the untainted\"\"one and it has never annoyed my eyes and\"\"they do say that I\\'d use some sort of a\"\"anti i sting technology and I\\'m not\"\"saying that that works really well and I\"\"wouldn\\'t say it does not leave any sort\"\"of a cast on the face so if you would\"\"like to have a sunscreen that doesn\\'t\"\"leave a cast on your face I would say\"\"that the amount from a large per se is a\"\"really good choice for many reasons and\"\"this stuff here I will say that it\\'s not\"\"as bad as the event one which started to\"\"really like burn around my eyes on the\"\"eyelids around this very the eyes the\"\"the area underneath my eye it started to\"\"warm and get the sort of burning\"\"sensation that just became worse and\"\"worse and worse I did not have it with\"\"this one here to the same degree as I\"\"had with the event one of us just like a\"\"little\"\"it but it it wasn\\'t that much I know my\"\"eyes it was more like receiving into my\"\"eyes and annoyed the eye itself so yes\"\"this is how it looks and is it something\"\"I will use no it is not and it feels\"\"another thing to say is that it feels\"\"crazy it\\'s easy to distribute on your\"\"face but it just has this drawback that\"\"it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s really crazy and it keeps\"\"being greasy and there when I looked in\"\"the mirror when I was outside it really\"\"did shine to high heaven so it really\"\"looked really glossy so yes this is not\"\"something I can recommend but if you\"\"can\\'t help yourself but wanting to try\"\"it try it out see how the color works\"\"and let me know it works for you if you\"\"would like to see more the sort of\"\"videos please subscribe in Tibetan to\"\"all those things to know to be notified\"\"when I put more disabilities thank you\"\"for watching see you bye\"\"hi I\\'m Melina cop the pimple calm and\"\"today I want to talk to you about\"\"once again my favorite brand that\"\"doesn\\'t pay me for these videos yes I\\'m\"\"not sponsored by this friend but I love\"\"them so much that I will shout my love\"\"for them from the rooftops every day I\"\"mean seriously I have converted so many\"\"people onto this brand that it\\'s not\"\"even funny\"\"today I\\'m talking about bio derma and\"\"specifically since you know I am like\"\"the biggest a sunscreen fan ever like as\"\"in I intend to look 19 for the rest of\"\"my life the reason that I can look 19\"\"for the rest of my life like the one\"\"thing that allows me to do that is\"\"sunscreen and so today I\\'m going to be\"\"talking about the Bioderma\"\"photo derm range of sunscreens so\"\"Bioderma has many different ranges they\"\"have ranges for sensitive skin the sense\"\"of bio range they have ranges for\"\"dehydrated skin and the Hydra bio range\"\"they have a range for acne prone skin\"\"the sebum range and they have the photo\"\"derm range it\\'s the orange one this\"\"range is amazing because it\\'s sunscreen\"\"and the thing that I love about Bioderma\"\"they provide broad-spectrum protection\"\"and they are often you know fragrance\"\"free and water resistance and these are\"\"things that you want to look for in a\"\"sunscreen in order to get adequate\"\"protection it\\'s really really important\"\"that you wear your sunscreen\"\"you should watch my sunscreen video to\"\"learn more about you know the difference\"\"between chemical and mineral sunscreens\"\"and all the rest of it basically there\"\"is no better one as long as you wear\"\"sunscreen that\\'s good the best sunscreen\"\"is the sunscreen that you actually put\"\"on your face the best sunscreen is the\"\"sunscreen that protects you but I mean\"\"there are brands out there that are\"\"terrible that don\\'t actually live up to\"\"their labels like Neutrogena so I do not\"\"use brands in you know the typical\"\"sunscreen aisle\"\"in the like a big store like Walmart I\"\"don\\'t know I only used sunscreens from\"\"two brands ok Bioderma or polish choice\"\"that\\'s it I am like very elitist with my\"\"sunscreen it has to be the best the best\"\"the best the best because as you know\"\"many sunscreens clog your pores and for\"\"me being you know skin health coach it\"\"would kind of be a little weird if I was\"\"using products that clogged my skin and\"\"many sunscreens in like natural skincare\"\"ranges contains so many different kinds\"\"of oils that they I don\\'t know how they\"\"even protect the skin from the Sun given\"\"that a lot of them have oils high up on\"\"the ingredient list that you know oils\"\"kind of attract the Sun as opposed to\"\"repel the sun\\'s on oil based sunscreen\"\"and no idea how that works from a\"\"chemical perspective but I know what it\"\"does so on a poor level it clogs it\"\"clogs it clogs your pores so I have all\"\"of these sunscreens from Bioderma and\"\"I\\'m gonna include the Hydra bio SPF 30\"\"in this because it is a very very good\"\"but if you want to hear about my review\"\"on this and watch the Hydra bio range\"\"video because this is an amazing a\"\"little everyday sunscreen so ok let\\'s\"\"begin with me be the body sunscreen\"\"because many of us forget that our body\"\"actually tends under the clothes as well\"\"especially you know in the summer when\"\"the Sun is so bright and so high\"\"especially depending on where you are in\"\"the world you know you can really cause\"\"some real damage and you don\\'t want to\"\"just protect your face your whole body\"\"kind of matters you know and I think\"\"it\\'s very important to wear sun\"\"protection liberally on your whole body\"\"in the summer and I love this because\"\"look how huge it is it is 400\"\"milliliters of spray sunscreen so you\"\"can kind of get to hard-to-reach places\"\"by spraying it I warn you this nozzle is\"\"very very strong this is SPF 50 photo\"\"derm max but it depends on where you are\"\"in the world because I believe in Canada\"\"they only have SPF 40 in this size and\"\"in this product so Bioderma\"\"is available literally all around the\"\"world that\\'s what I love about them\"\"that\\'s why I choose by odor mites I\"\"pretty much can find it in any pharmacy\"\"around of the world so I love how\"\"accessible it is and I love how well\"\"formulated the products are and I love\"\"that they\\'re broad-spectrum protection\"\"so you get UVA protection as well this\"\"one it does have an invisible texture\"\"even though it comes out white and it\"\"spreads very easily so I really like it\"\"but my favorite thing is like how big it\"\"is\"\"well how much sunscreen I get Bioderma\"\"products are really well priced for what\"\"they are for another one that covers the\"\"body but can also work on the face this\"\"is the photo derm sensitive SPF 50 this\"\"is literally probably the highest\"\"protection you can get because it has\"\"very high UVA protection\"\"it\\'s almost as high as the UVB\"\"protection here and what I love about\"\"Bioderma sunscreens is that they often\"\"will put the actual UVA rating as well\"\"as the UVB rating but they only do this\"\"in Europe keep that in mind because the\"\"rating system hasn\\'t been universally\"\"agreed upon yet around the world so like\"\"Asia has their own rating system europe\"\"has their own rating system the US\"\"doesn\\'t have a rating system the FDA is\"\"trying to figure that out now but Europe\"\"is more stringent on ingredients there\"\"really like on top of their I really\"\"like that they actually you know do a\"\"rating system and it kind of allows you\"\"to know like this sunscreens has better\"\"broad-spectrum protection then this\"\"sunscreen you know the rating system\"\"does help because some sunscreens have\"\"like a UVA rating of you know 20 some 30\"\"some 40 and so I choose the highest\"\"possible UVA protection because UVA rays\"\"are the ones that are going to jack up\"\"your collagen make your pores weak and\"\"saggy and more prone to acne so I\\'m like\"\"you no no no no thank you no thank you\"\"this is a thicker product its extreme\"\"milk very high protection photosensitive\"\"skin water resistance and without\"\"fragrance and it\\'s without parabens for\"\"those people who are afraid of paraben\"\"all the bio dermis and\"\"means our without parabens and you do\"\"either without fragrance I believe as\"\"well as far as I can see yep fragrance\"\"for me very very good product this one\"\"you can use on your body for like\"\"extremely high protection this is for\"\"those people who you know burn at the\"\"slightest bit of the Sun amazing amazing\"\"protection or like if you\\'re out on the\"\"beach where the highest protection\"\"possible like do it you know and try\"\"obviously to protect yourself like an\"\"umbrella out some protective clothing\"\"hats sunglasses so that you\\'re not\"\"burning your skin like it\\'s just not a\"\"good idea that tans are stupid\"\"get some self-tanner get a fake tan\"\"that\\'s what I do take down and I\\'ve used\"\"this on both the face and the body it\\'s\"\"thick on the face but still does an\"\"amazing job this is something I would\"\"wear if I\\'m literally out in the Sun\"\"which is something I tried to avoid\"\"doing but if like I\\'m at the beach and\"\"this is the sunscreen I\\'ll probably be\"\"using on my face I also have this one\"\"this is a photo Duramax SPF 100 I\\'m not\"\"sure that this is even available in\"\"North America because in North America I\"\"believe that anything above an SPF 50 is\"\"not sold and it\\'s not that it\\'s not sold\"\"because it doesn\\'t work or whatever it\\'s\"\"just that this is what happens with SPF\"\"SPF 30 protects you from 97% of the race\"\"so 3% still get in SPF 70 protects you\"\"from 98% of the race so you know\"\"anything above an SPF 50 is kind of\"\"almost the same as an SPF 50 but when I\"\"got this product I think I didn\\'t see\"\"anything else so I\\'m like I\\'m just\"\"taking it and this is very high\"\"protection for a sensitive skin and it\\'s\"\"a fluid texture so the texture is very\"\"light but I do find it can ball up on\"\"top of certain things so with some\"\"screens you might find that if you use\"\"like a silicone\"\"product underneath things your sunscreen\"\"might fall up and it\\'s just a matter of\"\"experimenting to find like the perfect\"\"combination of products that work\"\"together that don\\'t make the sunscreen\"\"fall up but what I do with this one in\"\"particular is I wear it on my morning\"\"I just simply washed my face and without\"\"anything on my face on my dry face I\"\"applied this sunscreen go for a run come\"\"back wash it off and then do the rest of\"\"my skincare routine I don\\'t wear SPF 100\"\"every single day but what I do do is I\"\"wear do you do I wear SPF 30 every\"\"single day a minimum of SPF 30 but I do\"\"wear SPF 50 when I\\'m out kind of more\"\"like out and about when I know I\\'ll be\"\"leaving the house I\\'m definitely wearing\"\"SPF 50 if it\\'s summer it\\'s gonna be\"\"definitely SPF 50\"\"I do SPF 30 minimum let\\'s say spring\"\"winter you know when I don\\'t see so much\"\"Sun but in the summer spring on days\"\"when I\\'m out SPF 50 is when I aim for it\"\"because I want to get maximum protection\"\"now speaking of SPF 50 this is what I\"\"love about Bioderma they have awesome\"\"SPF 50 these are both photo derm\"\"obviously but one is a R and one is\"\"laser\"\"they\\'re both creams and they\\'re both\"\"very high protection and they both have\"\"high UVA ratings and all the stuff but\"\"one of them is tinted the AR is tinted\"\"so this one is tinted tinted dude these\"\"are both like a pretty light cream\"\"texture they\\'re not heavy at all AR is\"\"tinted which I really really like it\"\"doesn\\'t have a white task on your skin\"\"when you apply it because it\\'s tinted\"\"but it\\'s not like tinted as in its gonna\"\"cover all the imperfections maybe it\"\"does so just very very subtly enough for\"\"those really subtle no makeup days I\"\"think it\\'s awesome you can still wear\"\"makeup on top if you want but I just\"\"like it on its own and it\\'s been my\"\"go-to I tested this out thoroughly I\\'m\"\"almost done with in my first ever bottle\"\"of this very close to empty what I don\\'t\"\"like about this product is that it only\"\"comes in 30 milliliters like it\\'s not\"\"enough for what it is because I applying\"\"my sunscreen generously like I go a bit\"\"on with this particular sunscreen you\"\"can\\'t be too generous because you can\"\"experience some filling\"\"when you use too much of this so you\"\"just use the amount that you need to get\"\"even coverage to protect your whole face\"\"but still this is like one of my\"\"ultimate favorite products probably ever\"\"because SPF 50 high UVA rating and also\"\"a very very good texture and it\\'s tinted\"\"like what else does a girl need this is\"\"my go-to summer\"\"product it has been to be fair my\"\"polished tres sunscreen that is tinted\"\"but SPF 30 is coming soon I have not\"\"fully tried like an entire bottle yet\"\"I\\'m only trying to sample there\\'s very\"\"good feedback on this particular\"\"something that I\\'m talking about though\"\"I would love to kind of compare the two\"\"but this price point is better than the\"\"Paula\\'s Choice and the SPF once again is\"\"higher so even if the polished choice\"\"might be more cosmetically elegant\"\"whatever this one is still better bang\"\"for the buck SPF 50 SPF 50 in the summer\"\"you know yeah I really love this product\"\"but I\\'ve got the on tinted version\"\"before I got the tinted version because\"\"I didn\\'t see the tinted version and so I\"\"have both but I prefer the tinted one\"\"even though they\\'re both fantastic\"\"products it\\'s just you know the tinted\"\"one you know it\\'s just it\\'s tinted so\"\"there\\'s no white cast on your skin I\\'m\"\"not saying that they all have serious\"\"white casts but again I\\'m a pale person\"\"so that\\'s something that you might want\"\"to consider like if you have darker skin\"\"they also this is the tent net you had\"\"the natural color but they have a golden\"\"color that\\'s even darker than this one\"\"so I would consider going for the darker\"\"color so that you don\\'t have to deal\"\"with the white cast that some sometimes\"\"sunscreens have the back white cast kind\"\"of means that the sunscreen has some\"\"good protection in there that\\'s you know\"\"doing something protecting me I don\\'t\"\"hate the white cast in sunscreens I\"\"always can you know even it out with\"\"some powder on top my mineral powder is\"\"plus about SPF 20 in it you can read\"\"about it on my blog or I\\'ll provide a\"\"link below it\\'s very important that you\"\"wear sunscreen and throughout the day if\"\"you need to reapply your sunscreen I\\'m\"\"gonna do a shout out for the spray\"\"sunscreen from the Hydra bio range it\\'s\"\"not in the photo derm range but it\\'s\"\"really really good plus the Hydra by a\"\"perfect ur SPF 30 is also an amazing\"\"everyday product for you know spring and\"\"winter like when you\\'re not really out\"\"or like you\\'re not leaving the house\"\"this is the product I like to wear SPF\"\"30 minimum even when I don\\'t leave the\"\"house that\\'s how legit I am too legit to\"\"quit and I like to carry this one around\"\"with me in my bag so that I can reapply\"\"throughout the day like on my body\"\"specifically I really like this and what\"\"I recommend you do with in terms of\"\"makeup like if you\\'re wearing makeup\"\"throughout the day I know you don\\'t want\"\"to glob on more sunscreen right that\\'s\"\"just gonna ruin your makeup and might\"\"feel gross and sticky and ridiculous so\"\"you can either do a fine mist of this\"\"but I prefer to just dust my face very\"\"generously with a powder that has SPF 20\"\"minimum in it and broad-spectrum UVA\"\"protection because mineral powders often\"\"come with zinc oxide titanium dioxide\"\"which is mineral sunscreen protection\"\"and it\\'s really really good so you can\"\"just be very generous with the powder\"\"throughout the day that has sun\"\"protection in it so that you are\"\"reapplying so that you\\'re continuing to\"\"be protected from the uva and UVB rays\"\"you don\\'t want to eat your skin that\\'s\"\"going to equal terrible skin i hope you\"\"really enjoyed this sunscreen video my\"\"dream come true a video about just\"\"sunscreen but i try and wear if you need\"\"help choosing the right sunscreen for\"\"you or if you need help like customizing\"\"your skincare routine because everyone\\'s\"\"skin is different and i understand that\"\"choosing a good product can be super\"\"confusing and super annoying and\"\"frustrating and instead of you know\"\"wasting\"\"money and getting like really frustrated\"\"with the process we just actually work\"\"with me have a routine review service\"\"where I work directly with clients like\"\"literally over Skype we chat we see each\"\"other where I learn everything about\"\"your skin type and curate like a\"\"customized am/pm skin care routine we\"\"talk about makeup everything that you\"\"need to put on your skin and then\"\"there\\'s no guesswork there\\'s no\"\"frustration there\\'s no wasted money\"\"there\\'s no clogged pores which that is\"\"so so you can check that out below i\"\"have a link to my routine review service\"\"and if you like this video give me a\"\"thumbs up let me know if you\\'ve tried\"\"any of these products in the comments\"\"below i would love to hear what you\"\"think and i\\'m also doing like daily\"\"almost instagram live videos where you\"\"can ask me questions live every day I\"\"call my daily powwow so that was a lot\"\"of information you\\'re like my dad links\"\"below this video thank you so much for\"\"watching I will talk to you soon this\"\"was a winner pop the pimple bathtub\"\"hello\"\"welcome back to my channel if you are\"\"here and you are new\"\"your comment as well today we\\'ll be\"\"talking about this bioderma photodam max\"\"spf 50 plus tinted cream\"\"sunscreen and i chose mine in color\"\"golden this\"\"is for sensitive skin and if you want to\"\"see\"\"how this is going to perform please keep\"\"on watching\"\"so as always my morning routine i always\"\"wash my face\"\"so that is what i normally do and you\"\"guys i\\'m not going to be\"\"going into detail with that i just want\"\"to show you just like\"\"the process before applying this\"\"sunscreen\"\"so that you can see that this is a\"\"genuine review and\"\"we are starting on a clean slate so when\"\"i\\'m done i just pat my face\"\"and i do not grab my face as i always\"\"say so i just pat my face\"\"dry and then go in with any serums that\"\"i\\'ll be going in with usually my morning\"\"skin care routine you guys is\"\"very very simple so when i\\'m done doing\"\"that i like to go in with the serums of\"\"the day my morning serums\"\"and just pat it on my face so that i can\"\"go\"\"in with my biodemo of course you guys i\"\"apply\"\"the moisturizer before this then go in\"\"with\"\"this sunscreen so it has been a month\"\"since i\\'ve been using this for sunscreen\"\"and i have a lot to say and this retails\"\"for 275. i got it from a discount\"\"and as you guys can see this is how it\"\"looks this is how golden looks like what\"\"kind of golden is the please make it\"\"make sense\"\"how is this golden color maybe you guys\"\"i\\'m just tripping but anyways that is\"\"how our golden color is looking\"\"i don\\'t know on which skin or maybe in\"\"what skin\"\"i have no idea guys but anyways we\\'re\"\"working with that color\"\"and it\\'s just like a sneak peek just to\"\"show you guys anyways i just wanted to\"\"show you that i\\'m dressed so\"\"i\\'m not naked y\\'all this is how my face\"\"is looking before i apply\"\"the sunscreen now i\\'m gonna apply this\"\"in three ways because i actually like\"\"tried to work around the sunscreen\"\"because already we can tell that\"\"this is not gonna be matching my skin at\"\"all so this is the normal way in which i\"\"would apply my normal sunscreen that\"\"doesn\\'t\"\"have any tint to it just to say guys\"\"this is a chemical sunscreen so\"\"it is not a mineral sunscreen sometimes\"\"i would expect mineral sunscreens to\"\"give us\"\"white colors but anyways we\\'re still in\"\"um i don\\'t know campaign to actually\"\"bag companies to give us products that\"\"are gonna match our skin\"\"i don\\'t know at all if it\\'s in it\\'s just\"\"difficult to make something that is\"\"going to match\"\"our skin colors or just this chemical\"\"filters\"\"j they\\'re just white or we can\\'t have\"\"any filters that are going to match our\"\"face\"\"i don\\'t know you guys but anyways i work\"\"that sunscreen into my skin and yeah it\"\"is cool right anyways\"\"let\\'s blend it um golden color into your\"\"skin baby your skin is golden your skin\"\"is\"\"gold so you need to match your skin so\"\"anyways i waited for 15 minutes because\"\"usually with my sunscreen\"\"i\\'d like to apply 15 minutes before if\"\"i\\'m not late you guys because sometimes\"\"i tend to bleed but anyways\"\"this is how we\\'re looking on the sun wow\"\"y\\'all this\"\"is beautiful isn\\'t it\"\"so this is the second take so i figured\"\"that that won\\'t work so let me try to\"\"apply this\"\"on my palm rub it on my palm and apply\"\"on my skin and see how this is going to\"\"work and as you guys can see i\\'m just\"\"using the same amount that\"\"i normally use on my sunscreen that\"\"doesn\\'t give me any white cast and you\"\"guys i\"\"am not slapping myself way too hard i am\"\"just trying to make sure that it is in\"\"my skin like it\\'s it\\'s\"\"it\\'s just like penetrating into my skin\"\"one thing i\\'ll say you guys this product\"\"doesn\\'t go\"\"it doesn\\'t penetrate my skin real quick\"\"and yeah if you\\'ve got sensitive skin\"\"this will make you rub your skin because\"\"you need to work it in as you guys can\"\"see it it honestly looks a little bit\"\"better\"\"when i use that method of putting in i\"\"then waited again for 15 minutes to see\"\"if it will absorb to my skin\"\"and i tried you guys it\\'s not the best\"\"but it did try so\"\"when you put it in you rub it on your\"\"palm and try to work it in it is a\"\"little bit\"\"better you do see a little bit of that\"\"white cast but you just need to put a\"\"little bit of work\"\"i hate putting a lot of work more\"\"especially in the morning we are late we\"\"are busy okay\"\"so i washed my face applied the\"\"moisturizer and\"\"the trick yeah this is the trick you\"\"need to apply your moisturizer\"\"and then real quick go in with that\"\"bioderma sunscreen\"\"and rub it on your palm and you are\"\"going to work in layers if you work in\"\"layers\"\"you are not going to go wrong now the\"\"problem is you are going to rub your\"\"skin way more and it is not good for\"\"those who have sensitive skin\"\"i feel like it would work very well if\"\"you\\'ve got them like fair\"\"very fair skin because this will just\"\"blend into your skin but you\\'ve got some\"\"melanin if you\\'re rich in melanin i\"\"don\\'t know you just need to\"\"like make it work okay like you have to\"\"work it in less as i\\'m doing here so i\"\"work in layers and you know apply\"\"another layer and\"\"wait apply another layer and wait and\"\"this was actually going in smoothly so\"\"it doesn\\'t work well when you apply a\"\"lot at the same time\"\"so you just need to make sure you\"\"prepare yourself\"\"early before you actually go out because\"\"you\\'re gonna need a lot of\"\"layers and patting in and if your skin\"\"becomes\"\"too sensitive through rubbing then it\\'s\"\"a problem now i\\'m gonna give it to this\"\"sunscreen\"\"um it doesn\\'t bend or stink it doesn\\'t\"\"even break me out at\"\"all and it just it feels good on skin\"\"it does give a little bit of\"\"moisturizing effect and again if you\\'ve\"\"got oily skin it tends to be oilier\"\"um greasy sort of during the day so i\"\"feel like it is also friendly for those\"\"who have got\"\"dry skin um i know if\"\"you have like oily skin and sometimes\"\"you need\"\"like products that are not going to be\"\"you know super oily so yeah take that\"\"so these are the pros it\\'s moisturizing\"\"it doesn\\'t give me any breakout\"\"now um the cons you guys white casts\"\"it doesn\\'t really go in smoothly it just\"\"takes time to absorb\"\"[Music]\"\"one thing that i\\'ll also say you guys is\"\"that this sunscreen doesn\\'t really work\"\"well\"\"with other serums so you need to just\"\"check\"\"which serums your morning serums this\"\"will\"\"not roll more especially when you are\"\"using the first and second method\"\"it is going to roll so i find it work a\"\"little bit better with\"\"the moisturizer now that is it you guys\"\"from me the golden lady and thank you so\"\"much you guys for watching please don\\'t\"\"forget subscribe to like and comment\"\"and i\\'ll see you guys on the next one\"\"bye\"\"my name is ramone cosmetic formulator\"\"aesthetician uk resident and along with\"\"that means i have access to some really\"\"good quality sunscreens and that was one\"\"of the things that i was so excited for\"\"when i was first moving here if you guys\"\"haven\\'t seen already i do have one video\"\"up on a review of a handful of some\"\"european sunscreens i got here at boots\"\"well we\\'re back to do a round two i have\"\"a few different options in front of me i\"\"have nevaeh or nivea i don\\'t care how to\"\"pronounce it if y\\'all call me in the\"\"comments that is on you bioderma and\"\"vichy today before i get into the video\"\"do you want to say stay tuned hit the\"\"subscribe button notification bell i\"\"have an entire bag full of european\"\"sunscreens i have yet to review i bought\"\"pretty much the entire lineup of user\"\"and sunscreens i also have a video\"\"coming up soon featuring easton freezie\"\"derm and heliocare so hit the\"\"notification bell to know when those\"\"videos go live as well so let\\'s get into\"\"the sunscreens i\\'ll put a card up here\"\"about some other videos where i feature\"\"some other european sunscreens but i am\"\"no stranger to these i\\'ve been using\"\"these now for well over six months for\"\"all let me see i use my handy little\"\"quarter teaspoon to measure out the\"\"quantity i do a full quarter teaspoon\"\"generally for face ears and neck but for\"\"the video since this is face application\"\"i do half of this which is an eighth\"\"teaspoon i\\'ll work that in let it sit\"\"for a few minutes so you can see the\"\"final finish and the look of it on the\"\"skin as well as if there\\'s any white\"\"cast so getting started first one we\"\"have is from nivea this is their nivea\"\"sun eevee face shine control this i\"\"bought a long time ago and actually got\"\"confused because i ended up buying two\"\"of these because one of them on the box\"\"just said shine control and the other on\"\"the box said mattifying effect and i\"\"thought they were separate things\"\"they\\'re not same thing this is from\"\"nivea these cost six pounds they cost\"\"costed they cost six pounds when i first\"\"bought them although now they are eight\"\"pound up boots but the magic of boots is\"\"a lot of times they have sales this is\"\"an spf 50 and it does have the uva\"\"circled on it they do designate this as\"\"high uva uvb protection on the back of\"\"this it does have four star uva\"\"protection in the bootstar system some\"\"marketing details nivea sun uv face\"\"shine control offers sun protection\"\"specifically designed for facial needs\"\"light formula offers long lasting and\"\"instant mattifying effects you will note\"\"that the cream absorbs excess oils from\"\"your skin\\'s surface and you\\'ll be\"\"protected from uv and high energy\"\"visible lights which can cause premature\"\"aging your skin will feel light\"\"non-greasy non-sticky it is eye friendly\"\"and ophthalmologically proven as well\"\"worth noting compared to the other ones\"\"in the video this one is not water\"\"resistant formula details uv filter wise\"\"stable benzone for uva octa satellite\"\"for uvb tenosurp s broad spectrum\"\"insulazole for more uvb and then even\"\"lt150 for qb as well this does have\"\"alcohol fragrance and essential oils in\"\"there and so it\\'s really interesting\"\"when they\\'re like oh it\\'s sensitive skin\"\"friendly but it does have those\"\"components and also the eye irritancy\"\"one is interesting as well because i\"\"mean like how do you test that i know\"\"how it\\'s tested but realistically how\"\"that\\'s a very general statement to make\"\"considering how subjective skin feel and\"\"overall experience can be with something\"\"like this does have a couple things like\"\"tapioca starch and silica which aid in\"\"some of the mattifying oil absorbing\"\"benefits to it but then it also has this\"\"specific licorice based extract and in\"\"the marketing for it does say that this\"\"does offer high energy visible light\"\"protection this specific licorice\"\"extract in this is the same exact one in\"\"my holy grail eucerin sunscreen but\"\"aside from that tocopherol acetate for\"\"vitamin e antioxidant benefits and\"\"that\\'s kind of the extent of formulation\"\"stand out my experience with this you\"\"can see with the application the texture\"\"for this is like a little bit creamy\"\"it\\'s got a little bit more body it\\'s not\"\"a true gel which i mean for the sake of\"\"comparison the used saran that i talked\"\"about that is one of my favorites very\"\"gel texture this gel creams a little bit\"\"more body to it and i just mentioned\"\"there\\'s a little bit more of an\"\"emollient component to the formulation\"\"of this it leaves a semi-radiant finish\"\"and it looks like it\\'s going on like a\"\"moisturizer this is one of those\"\"products that i use straight after\"\"rinsing as a one and done product this\"\"is my moisturizer my sunscreen has a\"\"little bit something extra in there as\"\"well but i don\\'t put much underneath\"\"this because the texture of this is a\"\"little bit more moisturizing you can see\"\"as it sets down to me it just leaves a\"\"natural glow to the skin i don\\'t think\"\"it\\'s it\\'s not very greasy it\\'s not very\"\"heavy but it is a moisturizing finish\"\"what\\'s interesting is the mattifying the\"\"shine control that to me is a bit of a\"\"stretch this to me is not modifying in\"\"the slightest but it is very oily skin\"\"compatible the way i see it is it kind\"\"of leaves a natural glow on your face\"\"and basically controls your oils from\"\"making you look any more shiny but you\"\"do have a natural like radiance to you\"\"that gives your skin some life you\\'re\"\"not flat matte dead but this is arguably\"\"i think my favorite in this entire video\"\"and i do use this very regularly because\"\"it\\'s very convenient for me especially\"\"on days when i need a little bit more\"\"moisturization next up on the list this\"\"is one i think i had a lot of comments\"\"when i went to the first european\"\"sunscreen video being like try bioderma\"\"try bioderma so i got a couple from them\"\"this is the bioderma photoderm max spf\"\"50 plus aqua fluid no this is the yellow\"\"tube this is spf 50 plus and this one\"\"has no tint apparently they offer a\"\"light tint and then a gold tint for this\"\"one i don\\'t know what that gold means i\"\"don\\'t know if it means that it\\'s like my\"\"complexion or darker but this does also\"\"come in tinted versions i just have the\"\"regular non-tinted one this was 15 pound\"\"this offers high eva evb and t shine\"\"protection i found on a separate\"\"retailer site because this is no longer\"\"on boots website don\\'t know why this had\"\"a uva pf specifically of 24 and i\\'m only\"\"noting that because uva\"\"circled anywhere on this i don\\'t believe\"\"and also it doesn\\'t give me a boot star\"\"rating either marketing points pleasant\"\"and easy application thanks to a fluid\"\"texture as light as water dry touch\"\"finish ideal for all skin types even\"\"combination to oily sensitive skin or\"\"intolerant to all types of sunlight very\"\"fair skin with freckles and exposed skin\"\"to maximum sunlight those are all the\"\"skin types and conditions that this is\"\"acceptable for oil-free formula\"\"non-greasy texture good skin tolerance\"\"non-comedogenic unfragranced water\"\"resistant and then main marketing points\"\"behind bowdermist sunscreens is they\"\"have a cellular bioprotection trademark\"\"patent and that is essentially some sort\"\"of like antioxidant situation that they\"\"say boost the overall sun efficacy and\"\"that is some sort of like bioderma\"\"proprietary patent on a specific\"\"formulation component that boosts sun\"\"protection factor of your skin and\"\"aiding with the sunscreen it\\'s the\"\"marketing for it was really weird but on\"\"top of that this also has a synergistic\"\"combination of three powders that give a\"\"mattifying dry touch finish filters in\"\"this this features octokrylan which is\"\"dvb into some of the longer wavelength\"\"uva tinasorb m which is a hybrid filter\"\"it is a chemical filter by composition\"\"but it\\'s an insoluble particle so it\\'s a\"\"solid particle that\\'s suspended in the\"\"formulation so it acts a little bit more\"\"like a mineral filter you have able\"\"benzone which is uva 1 and uva 2 and\"\"then latinos or m i believe is broad\"\"spectrum and then tinos orb s which is\"\"broad spectrum as well so really good\"\"broad spectrum protection and then bumps\"\"up on either end as well this is alcohol\"\"fragrance and essential oil free which\"\"is worth noting because they do make\"\"cleanse this is like great for sensitive\"\"skin or very compromised skin and then\"\"you have the things that help with water\"\"resistance the mattifiers this does have\"\"more emollience in the formulation i\"\"think experience for this you can see as\"\"i\\'m depositing it into the teaspoon this\"\"is liquidy and if i could just boil this\"\"down to one statement this is like the\"\"sister the wannabe sister of the la\"\"roche posay and thalios choco fluid\"\"sunscreen very similar texture and it\"\"feels like it wants to be the same\"\"product there\\'s a lot of things that\"\"they\\'re not the same first and foremost\"\"talking about the uv protection minds\"\"you spf 50 plus no uva circled on this\"\"that i could find i also did throw away\"\"the box though so if you got the box and\"\"it circled on there comment that down\"\"below but there\\'s also no boot star\"\"rating on this either and i did find a\"\"uva pf rating of 24 which if you\\'re\"\"using like the ppd system like the pa\"\"pluses that you see on korean sunscreens\"\"this would be a pa 4 plus technically\"\"and regardless that is a great daily\"\"sunscreen situation the other part of\"\"this is the fact that it says it\\'s\"\"supposed to be matte with powder dry\"\"touch finish if you look on the screen i\"\"feel like i look i have a gloss to me\"\"it\\'s not greasy but it\\'s like i look\"\"shiny and i don\\'t understand that and i\"\"don\\'t like the way this looks on my skin\"\"if i\\'m going to be honest part of that\"\"reason is because after a little bit i\"\"feel like my skin looks dry but oily if\"\"that makes any sense but also this has\"\"that tenosurp m component and i\"\"mentioned it basically functions like a\"\"mineral sunscreen it makes this cling to\"\"my facial hair so it looks like i\"\"essentially have a dusting of like white\"\"setting powder all over my mustache my\"\"eyebrows my hairline and my beard so\"\"this is one thing i like to wear under\"\"makeup because i think it does prep the\"\"skin nicely for makeup i just don\\'t like\"\"it by itself and also the other part of\"\"it is it does this thing on like my\"\"under eyes where it gives them like a\"\"great cast next up though from bioderma\"\"again this is their photoderm akn mats\"\"notice this is a white bottle and this\"\"is spf 30. for this one uva is circled\"\"but again no designation on bootstars\"\"for this marketing for this a bioderma\"\"innovation the exclusive fluid active\"\"trademark patent in photoderm akn matte\"\"biologically regulates sebum quality to\"\"keep pores from becoming clogged and\"\"prevent the appearance of blemishes\"\"which is often exacerbated after periods\"\"of sun exposure photogram akn matte\"\"offers real internal biological\"\"protection again that cellular\"\"bioprotection pen and then it also says\"\"this exclusive patent preserves and\"\"stimulates the skin\\'s defenses during\"\"sun exposure so basically long lasting\"\"matte claims non-greasy finish no white\"\"cast they want to emphasize this one\"\"does have a sense to it and it\\'s also\"\"waterproof so talking about some of the\"\"claims that fluid active was interesting\"\"because this one is matte i mean it\\'s in\"\"the name matte this one specifically\"\"talks about a patent to regulate sebum\"\"and keep the skin matte that the other\"\"photoderm didn\\'t have the patented\"\"complex fights against sebum thickening\"\"in order to keep portion becoming\"\"clogged and to minimize the risk of\"\"blemishes appearing which is interesting\"\"so this features salicylic and glycolic\"\"acid i don\\'t think i\\'ve ever seen\"\"glycolic acid in the sunscreen period\"\"and i don\\'t think i\\'ve ever seen\"\"salicylic acid any sunscreen either\"\"those are exfoliants which is fun i like\"\"that again one and done products who\"\"just love that get your exfoliation and\"\"your sun protection all in one go but i\"\"think those are partly responsible for\"\"that seven regulating benefit salicylic\"\"acid as well as the component of\"\"preventing the pores from becoming\"\"clogged then you also have tocopherol\"\"and tocopheroacetate so both forms of\"\"vitamin e then you have ectoin and\"\"propyl gallate which are antioxidants\"\"you also have ginkgo biloba extract\"\"which always reminds me of fenty skin\"\"love her and then golden kelp which is a\"\"kelp extract and kind of aids in water\"\"binding so it\\'s like humectant benefits\"\"but can also potentially have some skin\"\"soothing benefits or antioxidant\"\"benefits as well filters this has\"\"octopriline so uvb uva2 tinosorb m once\"\"again so that\\'s that broad spectrum\"\"hybrid filter and then evobenzone for\"\"uva protection less filters but\"\"interesting assortment again this is\"\"only spf 30 which is perfectly adequate\"\"great daily protection or if you don\\'t\"\"necessarily need the high high high\"\"factor because again this is water\"\"resistant so it\\'s great for daily on the\"\"go or just like minimal sun exposure\"\"where for example you might sweat a lot\"\"but again it\\'s interesting again i point\"\"out this is spf 30 does have that uva\"\"circle could not find a uva pf rating\"\"for this but the other bio dimmer\"\"doesn\\'t have that why is that but as you\"\"see with the application similar body\"\"similar texture it\\'s very watery\"\"lightweight it is giving that la roche\"\"posay and thalios fluid this goes on\"\"nicely though i think i have a\"\"preference for this specific one over\"\"the other bioderma what i will say is\"\"that i also definitely like to\"\"moisturize well underneath this this in\"\"itself does have some emollients and\"\"body to it but the mattifying effect of\"\"this on non-moisturized skin can get\"\"very unpleasant very quick so it\\'ll be\"\"moisturized very well i think this is\"\"beautiful for oily skin i wouldn\\'t\"\"recommend these for dry skin i\\'m gonna\"\"be honest just for that finish and\"\"texture issue and for either of these if\"\"you have deep skin i would not count on\"\"these just because of the teenage sort\"\"of m elements and then last sunscreen\"\"this is the vichy ideal soleil\"\"mattifying face dry touch sun cream so i\"\"was very excited to try some vichy\"\"options vichy to me it\\'s like a very\"\"french pharmacy and i don\\'t know why\"\"because i think technically bioderma is\"\"too but vichy\\'s like the pinnacle of\"\"like french pharmacy to me so i was very\"\"excited to try this out this is 16 pound\"\"50 for 50ml the marketing behind this is\"\"idiosola modifying face dry touch spf 50\"\"helps protect the skin against the\"\"harmful effects of sun into uv has soft\"\"dry touch zero shine water resistant\"\"finish they do say suitable for\"\"combination and sensitive skin and then\"\"it\\'s enriched with vichy mineralizing\"\"thermal water again this is spf 50 this\"\"does have a uva plus circled there is no\"\"uva pf indicated on this either but i do\"\"trust that this has good protection this\"\"formula includes a white spectrum filter\"\"system and photostable uva ebv based\"\"mixorals mixorals are l\\'oreal patented\"\"filters vichy is a l\\'oreal sub brand and\"\"then that vichy mineral water so a lot\"\"of brands like lourish jose vichy really\"\"center around this thermal water\"\"situation and we should explain it like\"\"this vichy mineral water strengthens the\"\"natural defenses of the skin the\"\"volcanic water of vichy was born from\"\"the volcanoes of ovarn rich in 15\"\"essential minerals so essentially it\\'s\"\"like water that\\'s volcanic water\"\"enriched with minerals that can really\"\"aid in the skin barrier function and\"\"moisturization and blah blah blah so\"\"filter wise you have homosalates\"\"octosale evinol t150 tinosorp s mixoral\"\"xl avobenzone octocrylene mixoryl sx and\"\"nanotitanium dioxide so you got a whole\"\"salad up in there of uv filters\"\"primarily these are all chemical filters\"\"we do see that nano titanium dioxide\"\"always a concern anytime you see a\"\"mineral or mineral adjacent filter but\"\"it\\'s nano so that hopefully will aid in\"\"a little bit more elegance per se but\"\"aside from that this is alcohol free but\"\"this is fragrance and this is fragranced\"\"underlying exclamation points this is\"\"perfumey it\\'s giving macy\\'s fragrance\"\"counter the fragrance on this one is\"\"strong and if you have compromised skin\"\"i\\'m gonna be honest my eye areas right\"\"now very compromised they were on fire\"\"when i put this on so i don\\'t know why\"\"this is compatible with sensitive skin\"\"because i disagree that\\'s just me and\"\"then there\\'s a couple botanical based\"\"extracts for example there\\'s a cinnamon\"\"botanical extract in this which i looked\"\"into what it could potentially do skin\"\"wise and it has potentially a steady\"\"sauce some potential and anti-terrorism\"\"and antioxidant benefits which basically\"\"means it can kind of help with pigment\"\"fading benefits and also some\"\"antioxidant protection the big one for\"\"this one though is that it\\'s mattifying\"\"it\\'s mattifying dry touch i agree with\"\"those claims but i didn\\'t find it was a\"\"very elegant experience you can see i\"\"put it on this is more of a gel\"\"situation so it\\'s very reminiscent of\"\"the eucerin it\\'s not as moisturizing\"\"though it doesn\\'t have that annoyance\"\"that the nivea one kind of does this one\"\"definitely does have this dry down like\"\"dry touch effect that fragrance is so\"\"strong it does linger for like at least\"\"half an hour afterwards maybe a little\"\"bit more and that\\'s definitely just the\"\"biggest thing this does have that\"\"fragrance to it texture wise this does\"\"wear really nice under makeup i find it\"\"does prep the skin well i\\'m wearing it\"\"under my face right now if you\"\"moisturize well underneath this you\"\"don\\'t have any issues with it cleaning\"\"to texture or any dry patches on the\"\"skin but you do have to moisturize even\"\"having oily skin use a gel moisturizer\"\"but you will have to pipe your skin\"\"adequately for this and you can\\'t see it\"\"right now but when i look in the mirror\"\"i see it i just have like a coating a\"\"dusting of whites on my facial hair my\"\"mustache and everything in my eyebrows\"\"because of this and i\\'m going to\"\"attribute that more to the titanium\"\"dioxide in this so it\\'s not really\"\"elegant in dark hair dark facial hair or\"\"whatnot so that\\'s another big con if you\"\"apply this in the right way this is very\"\"nice it\\'s very workable but you will\"\"have to tolerate that fragrance so with\"\"that that is round two of european\"\"chemist pharmacy sunscreens this was a\"\"toss up really some of these are not\"\"that great or they\\'re like a very\"\"mid-tier there\\'s like things i could do\"\"to like bump them up but they\\'re just\"\"they\\'re not great the nevaeh one i think\"\"is my favorite out of all these and i do\"\"reach for it pretty substantially let me\"\"know down below in the comments section\"\"what other boots related or european\"\"chemist sunscreens do you want to see me\"\"review on the channel don\\'t forget to\"\"hit the subscribe button notification\"\"bell so that you know when i post more\"\"skincare sunscreen and fancy rated\"\"content on my channel give it a thumbs\"\"up and thanks for watching guys bye\"\"[Music]\"\"you\"\"hi today I\\'m reviewing the Bioderma\"\"photo durm aqua fluid SPF and really\"\"quick I just want to say purchase eye\"\"products with my own money\"\"I\\'ll never waste your time with\"\"sponsored ads or videos so if you want\"\"to help support the channel check out no\"\"BS beauty comm check out my patreon\"\"community or click on the Amazon link\"\"below okay so these were this is another\"\"sunscreen I picked up at look\"\"fantasticks UK page they should be\"\"paying me like a referral fee because\"\"I\\'m advertising for them a lot anyway\"\"that\\'s where I picked up most of the\"\"European type sunscreens where is in the\"\"US it\\'s difficult to get them because\"\"the FDA is about 50 years behind on\"\"sunscreen approvals literally I think\"\"it\\'s like been since 1970 since they\"\"approved any new filters something like\"\"that something crazy so anyway there\\'s\"\"some ways around it I like to find the\"\"way around it because you know if you\"\"live in the US and you\\'re using a\"\"typical chemical sunscreen you\\'re not\"\"really getting great UVA coverage and\"\"UVA rays are once that cause wrinkles\"\"and fine lines and skin damage so keep\"\"that in mind most Americans probably\"\"would age so much better if they had\"\"access to European sunscreens but most\"\"I\\'m probably a lot of them probably\"\"don\\'t even know what they\\'re missing\"\"until you\\'ve tried them and not at least\"\"I didn\\'t so anyway Bioderma calls this a\"\"very high sun protection with a fluid\"\"texture as light as water with a dry\"\"touch finish suitable for all skin types\"\"even combination to oily skin skin that\"\"is sensitive to are intolerant to all\"\"types of sunlight very fair-skinned with\"\"freckles and skin that as a pole exposed\"\"to maximum sunlight or anybody that\"\"really just wants to prevent aging okay\"\"so let me get to my first criteria which\"\"is packaging and I like the packaging\"\"nice squeeze to bottle although it does\"\"have a tendency to be very goopy when\"\"you open it up and it\\'s got kind of a\"\"needle nose tip on it so just keep that\"\"in mind once you start once you dump it\"\"over it\\'ll start leaking out and I\\'ll\"\"apply it in a second so okay no issues\"\"with that\"\"in terms of denatured or drying types of\"\"alcohol this does not have any of those\"\"so that\\'s always a good thing even\"\"though it\\'s got a nice liquid texture no\"\"drain alcohols does contain some fatty\"\"alcohols such as sea 20-22 which are a\"\"good type of alcohol a few of you\"\"mention the crave beauty beat the beat\"\"the sunscreen beat the Sun sunscreen\"\"which I reviewed a few days ago and\"\"really liked a lot of the\"\"characteristics of it but we\\'re not so\"\"excited that alcohol is higher up on the\"\"ingredient list in my opinion this is a\"\"good alternative to that it\\'s got all of\"\"the good characteristics of it without\"\"the alcohol so I mentioned that as\"\"something worth checking out if you were\"\"a very sensitive skin or a bit nervous\"\"about that\"\"so something worth considering terms of\"\"fragrance this does not have any\"\"fragrance in it which is great and no\"\"scent at all it doesn\\'t even have the\"\"chemical sunscreen smell which most or a\"\"lot of chemical sunscreens have so this\"\"one\\'s awesome because there\\'s literally\"\"no scent to it so very great for\"\"sensitive skin in terms of the\"\"manufacturing location this one is made\"\"in France so no issues at all with that\"\"SPF coverage which is UVB coverage is\"\"50-plus so that means it\\'s great I\"\"recommend at least 30 everyday and 50 is\"\"great especially if you wear a\"\"foundation over your sunscreen the more\"\"layers you apply over sunscreen the more\"\"diluted the coverage potentially can be\"\"I saw on a chart the other day it was a\"\"sunscreen product the chart had the list\"\"of order of ingredients or what you use\"\"so you cleanse you tone serum sunscreen\"\"primer then foundation and I thought you\"\"know what I always apply my primer\"\"before the sunscreen just because any\"\"layer you put over it has a potential to\"\"kind of decrease the amount of\"\"protection you\\'re getting so something\"\"worth considering I always play my\"\"primer before hand although it kind of\"\"sometimes defeats a bit of the point of\"\"primer so even just foundation could\"\"kind of dilute it a little bit so I\"\"that\\'s why I think in my opinion thirty\"\"is the least but fifty is good\"\"especially if you\\'re gonna play\"\"foundation or makeup over it it\\'s just\"\"you\\'re getting much better protection\"\"although one thing to keep in mind the\"\"amok you go over thirty you\\'re not\"\"getting you\\'re not getting twenty more\"\"than third it kind of decreases a little\"\"bit the higher up you go but it\\'s still\"\"stronger and better so okay terms of the\"\"UVA protection factor this one has a PPD\"\"of twenty four which is something I\"\"would wanted to remember to mention it\"\"more often which is persistent pigment\"\"darkening so sixteen and up on that\"\"scale qualifies as adequate protection\"\"the higher up the number the better some\"\"sunscreens have demonstrated a PPD of 65\"\"or higher so that\\'s very good coverage\"\"so this one\\'s twenty four so that\\'s\"\"pretty good up there pretty good up\"\"there pretty good pretty high up there\"\"so I have no issues with that it\\'s\"\"probably much better than the average US\"\"sunscreen okay then in terms of the\"\"filters used in this we\\'ve got Evo Ben\"\"zone which is a UV Avery absorber which\"\"is typically unstable but it can be\"\"helped with the use of other filters in\"\"it which can help it be a bit more\"\"stable although AVO Ben zone on its own\"\"for just UVA rays is probably what most\"\"US sunscreens have and it\\'s not not good\"\"enough in my opinion so then we\\'ve got\"\"octo cry lean which is a UVB absorber\"\"and it also has the ability to absorb\"\"some short UVA rays I\\'m sorry if you can\"\"hear my dogs barking I know someone must\"\"be walking up and down the street or\"\"there\\'s a squirrel in the yard so I\\'m\"\"sure you can hear it I\\'m sorry okay\"\"then we\\'ve got methylene\"\"you know there must be like a turkey in\"\"the yard or something\"\"okay then I\\'ve got methylene biz Benza\"\"Trion tetramethyl beautiful which is\"\"also known as vis acht result which is a\"\"broad-spectrum UVA and UVB ray absorber\"\"it also has some ability to reflect and\"\"scatter UV light so it\\'s a great filter\"\"then we\\'ve got tin syrup s which is a\"\"UVA and UVB ray absorber also very photo\"\"stable so we\\'ve got a good variety of\"\"filters for both UVA and UVB rays so I\"\"have no issues with that then we get\"\"into the white cast and I will apply it\"\"and this one really doesn\\'t have a white\"\"cast see how liquidy it comes out man\"\"the dogs are just going crazy okay so\"\"after you apply it it does take a minute\"\"to really soak it in but for the most\"\"part there\\'s not much of a white cast\"\"initially it looks like you\\'re gonna\"\"have a white cast and maybe it has a\"\"very mild white cast but for the most\"\"part in my opinion this is one of the\"\"better sunscreens in terms of white\"\"casts because there isn\\'t much once it\"\"absorbs really sets to a nice matte\"\"finish with not much minimal white cast\"\"if anything and there you go so I in my\"\"opinion you can\\'t really see a white\"\"cast so and after it\\'s so give after you\"\"give it a couple minutes to soak in it\"\"really has no light cast Lincoln honey\"\"what trouble are you causing those tails\"\"are just out of control\"\"Notty okay so I\\'ll do a pH test just for\"\"you guys and gals I love the pH so\"\"I would say it\\'s a pH of about five ish\"\"maybe five and a half maybe so no issues\"\"with that one okay in terms of texture\"\"obviously it\\'s a very goopy liquidy\"\"texture which isn\\'t always the easiest\"\"to work with because it is so liquidy\"\"although I guess in the title aqua fluid\"\"I guess you get that although what I\"\"like about it is after it\\'s soaked in\"\"after you\\'ve given a few minutes to soak\"\"in it really scents to a nice matte non\"\"sticky finish which is a big deal for a\"\"lot of people so after you give it a\"\"minute or two to soak in it\\'s really not\"\"sticking doesn\\'t transfer a ton so\"\"that\\'s always a nice factor as well so\"\"no issues with the texture although I\"\"guess it says it\\'s fluid ease of use so\"\"smooths over skin very easily slightly\"\"hydrating works well over most\"\"moisturizers and primers I could give a\"\"minute to absorb sets to a nice\"\"invisible finish a great option for\"\"those that don\\'t wear foundation or even\"\"if you do our foundation good option for\"\"that too but I know a lot of people that\"\"don\\'t wear foundation really like\"\"something that sets to a nice matte\"\"finish with no noticeable white cast so\"\"there we go\"\"and now that it\\'s absorbed it\\'s not\"\"sticky at all so very nice okay then in\"\"terms of antioxidants and beneficial\"\"ingredients this one contains a lot of\"\"slip and basic hydrating ingredients not\"\"a ton of real beneficial ingredients or\"\"antioxidants which is kind of in my\"\"opinion the major downside with this one\"\"is there\\'s really not a ton of great\"\"stuff it\\'s got vitamin E which is great\"\"xylitol and mannitol which are both\"\"humectants and that\\'s about it for\"\"really exciting beneficial ingredients\"\"so if you\\'re gonna use this one I really\"\"recommend applying over a really good\"\"vitamin C serum or another great\"\"hydrating serum or moisturizer so\"\"that\\'s got some good things for your\"\"skin so your skin isn\\'t just totally\"\"relying on this to do it all because it\"\"really it can it can block the Rays but\"\"it can\\'t help really hydrate skin or\"\"anything else for that matter so keep\"\"that one in mind that in terms of acne\"\"genic ingredients does have a few acne\"\"triggers so we\\'ve got glyceryl stearate\"\"citrate which is a fungal acne trigger\"\"and then vitamin E which is can be very\"\"acne genic for some people so that\\'s\"\"about it so pretty friendly for acne\"\"prone skin with the exception of the\"\"vitamin E then we\\'ve got animal testing\"\"and unfortunately Bioderma is not\"\"cruelty free which surprised me because\"\"for some reason I guess it\\'s been a\"\"while since I reviewed anything for\"\"Bioderma but they are sold in mainland\"\"China so they\\'re not cruelty free then\"\"in terms of performance I\\'m really happy\"\"with it lasts nicely on skin without\"\"breaking up foundation or becoming oily\"\"or greasy feeling throughout the day\"\"partially water resistant as well great\"\"for sensitive skin especially with the\"\"fact that has no alcohol and no\"\"fragrance performs above average it\"\"exceeded my expectations in my opinion\"\"so it\\'s quite happy with it it does take\"\"a little bit of finesse to remove at the\"\"end of the day the more water resistant\"\"the sunscreen is the trickier I find\"\"them to be to remove they just require a\"\"bit more effort so if you use this one\"\"might be wise to do a two step cleanse\"\"so oil based cleanser first and then a\"\"soapy cleanser after that just to make\"\"sure you move it all because you\"\"certainly don\\'t want to go to bed with\"\"any traces of sunscreen on your skin\"\"just for so many reasons especially acne\"\"and things like that okay then in terms\"\"of the price so this is the full size\"\"which is 1.33 ounces which is the\"\"equivalent of 40 milliliters and retails\"\"for about 17 dollars wherever your look\"\"so that averages out to about 42 cents\"\"per milliliter which is in the very\"\"affordable ring\"\"it\\'s not the cheapest sunscreen I\\'ve\"\"reviewed but it\\'s also not the most\"\"expensive so that\\'s a nice factor so on\"\"the saris car scale with 15 being\"\"perfect this one is guarded 12 so pretty\"\"good couple things I might mess with on\"\"it maybe not but overall it\\'s still\"\"pretty pretty darn good option so anyway\"\"I\\'m interested in hearing from you guys\"\"if you\\'ve had a chance to try this I\"\"think there\\'s another Bioderma product\"\"coming up that I\\'ll be reviewing this\"\"week as well so be sure to stay tuned\"\"for that one so anyway I love hearing\"\"from you guys so leave your comments and\"\"I will see you more tomorrow thank you\"\"so much guys\"\"well hey guys it is Saturday it\\'s the\"\"weekend before a New Year\\'s Eve New\"\"Year\\'s Day so yeah you\\'re watching this\"\"the weekend after more than likely but\"\"this morning I cracked into a new\"\"sunscreen and I finished up the one that\"\"I was using before from Europe and I\"\"cracked into you this morning I cracked\"\"into the via derma photo jar max I think\"\"it\\'s called SPF 50 plus also from Europe\"\"that one of you all sent me I really\"\"like it it\\'s very liquidy so you know\"\"it\\'s it it\\'s fragrance free as as all of\"\"the European sunscreens it\\'s got UVA\"\"filters that are a little bit more photo\"\"stable than those we have here in the US\"\"and I blend it in really nicely to the\"\"skin no white cast moisturizing that\"\"there wasn\\'t like any alcohol leanness\"\"to it\"\"I think oily skin types would like it\"\"yeah but anyways I\\'m headed over to my\"\"mom\\'s house we\\'re gonna have some lunch\"\"get cracking on our planners it\\'s kind\"\"of a gloomy day and it\\'s been raining so\"\"the allergens are high that it\\'s what\"\"it\\'s going on hope everybody is having a\"\"fantastic new year and sailing right\"\"along as you saw this morning my\"\"Christmas tree is still up all pokey on\"\"getting not Downers then ocupado but\"\"lately a lot of things so that is on my\"\"to-do list for this upcoming week as to\"\"a sadly take down my tree Joe down some\"\"of my deck or on my kitchen counter but\"\"and that\\'s so sad for me because\"\"honestly Christmas is like the only\"\"thing I really get into we dig forward\"\"for and even that\\'s pretty minimal now\"\"it\\'s like anyways I\\'m here so I\\'ll check\"\"me good well hey guys I just made it to\"\"my mom\\'s house and um looks like she is\"\"picking down a Christmas decor as well\"\"slowly but surely in a piecemeal fashion\"\"that movie\"\"the village is bare my mom has taken the\"\"village down but um I\\'m just making a\"\"tea for myself here with the Nutcracker\"\"mug before he gets put away and I\\'m\"\"gonna try this Christmas morning black\"\"and green tea bites - you guys\"\"recommended these teas and this one\"\"looks like a good one so we\\'ll give it a\"\"try here and see how it goes\"\"yeah they were out of the Stello at the\"\"grocery store um last time that I want\"\"to repurchase it and I tried the Jabalia\"\"have you guys ever had Jabalia so it\\'s\"\"pretty good I\\'ve been drinking that um\"\"and it\\'s a little milder than the\"\"vostell oo but it\\'s a good one I also\"\"like Lavazza\"\"a lot but for whatever reason Lavazza\"\"sells out really fast and I have a\"\"difficult time sourcing it and you\"\"already had lunch I\\'m gonna move so I\\'m\"\"just about to make my own cauliflower\"\"oats um I have a recipe for this close\"\"to down below but I\\'m gonna use and the\"\"timer\\'s just going off but my mom has um\"\"some frozen rice cauliflower here you\"\"got this at Costco yeah is that what we\"\"had on not Christmas Day it\\'s really\"\"good um\"\"it is the Maas River organic rice\"\"cauliflower and it comes in these little\"\"pouches and I guess you could put this\"\"in the microwave\"\"oh wait for five minutes the first three\"\"minutes then you rub you flip it over\"\"you don\\'t flip it over what you rotate\"\"it yeah yeah I\\'m doing the microwave\"\"it\\'s easier\"\"well no I\\'m gonna do it on the stove but\"\"so the Christmas morning black tea I\"\"have to say tastes just like you mean\"\"ordinary black tea I don\\'t really taste\"\"either the green tea component or\"\"anything particularly Christmasy about\"\"it um so if you like black tea you might\"\"like that one but I have to say I have\"\"had this Christmas in Paris this is a\"\"nighttime caffeine free one and this one\"\"is really good it\\'s kind of got a\"\"chocolatey taste to it\"\"subtly so this is probably one of my\"\"favorites that I\\'ve had from stash so\"\"far what did you think of Christmas in\"\"Paris did you like it\"\"no the nighttime line yeah so I\\'ve just\"\"got my colleague rice cauliflower\"\"cooking up here and I\\'m going to add a\"\"third of a cup of these are rolled oats\"\"just from Quaker Oatmeal\"\"and I\\'m gonna let that cook on here and\"\"then I\\'m gonna add half a serving of the\"\"chocolate organic protein so this is the\"\"candle that I mentioned in my lifestyle\"\"favorites video the Tuscany candle um I\"\"think I called it balsam fir I haven\\'t\"\"tried this one but you guys know I love\"\"the Tuscany candle companies but it\\'s\"\"actually called first snow that my mom\"\"has and she doesn\\'t have it lit\"\"currently five he\\'s got you lit it this\"\"morning yeah that\\'s the wax not going\"\"and you can\"\"smell it\\'s really nice yeah it really\"\"does it smells like like we\\'re Narnia in\"\"here it\\'s a good January fragrance you\"\"find it on sale you should get you know\"\"is that too much you only live one hi\"\"hat my mom was just sharing with me some\"\"bread that she\\'s tried out you might\"\"tell him what it is I got this at Whole\"\"Foods they\\'re calling it cinnamon raisin\"\"bread natural but it\\'s vegan I guess\"\"yeah and gluten free it\\'s got it\\'s made\"\"with garbanzo bean flour and potato\"\"starch oh cool it\\'s not um yeah garbanzo\"\"bean flour rice milk and an egg replacer\"\"so no eggs cool it tastes good I enjoyed\"\"it doesn\\'t taste almond butter and I\\'m\"\"thinking it would be good I bet it would\"\"yeah whoo I guess an apple butter but\"\"that has so much sugar you can make make\"\"it it\\'s pretty easy to make it like I\"\"thought yeah what\\'s uh what\\'s going on\"\"in your nails here oh look look my mom\"\"got a gel manicure\"\"no these are just a little stick on\"\"there pretty I guess that\\'s something\"\"fun to do where\\'d you get that I bought\"\"these at Walmart they actually look you\"\"did a good job putting them on there\"\"yeah they\\'re pretty no-brainer yeah\"\"hey you know you they just have a little\"\"thing on the back you peel it off the\"\"sticker come on Wow\"\"yeah yeah that sounds like something I\"\"could handle I wonder how easy they are\"\"to get off though I watched his vlog and\"\"she just hope you know one under here\"\"okay can\\'t be so amazing no that\\'s handy\"\"I don\\'t think they\\'re gonna last very\"\"long well I look you did a good job\"\"putting them on there I thought you got\"\"I thought you got a special manicure and\"\"I thought oh here she\\'s going on the\"\"jail bandwagon whatever you have floss\"\"tubers she gave a really good tutorial\"\"about how about how to use you did a\"\"good job she always has the seasonal\"\"ones yeah\"\"yeah I\\'ve seen people talk about that\"\"what is it Jam Jam Rapstar jam Jam\"\"regeneration I showed what it is impress\"\"well they are pretty impressive looking\"\"helpful tips new yeah I\\'m impressed\"\"wasn\\'t with houses how well they look\"\"yeah it\\'s like you got a manicure they\"\"feel pretty we\\'re awfully pretty sturdy\"\"and cut them down yeah I don\\'t like long\"\"nails yeah we got a pinky one you want\"\"to put it on our path here\\'s the final\"\"product I have my cauliflower oats I\"\"mixed in some blueberries and then I\"\"topped it with some of that Cambria joys\"\"granola and my mom has these little\"\"banana chips that I decorated around and\"\"then I just dusted some cinnamon on top\"\"so that looks delicious I\\'ve got one of\"\"my tutti fruity spoons here and a little\"\"orange though that\\'s what I\\'m having and\"\"then my mom has these strawberry oh\"\"sorry cos I really like these you get\"\"those at Kroger and you\\'re working on\"\"your Scotty so I got you right yeah yeah\"\"and I got my planner here and some\"\"correspondents I need to work on and\"\"look at all of my planner supplies here\"\"in this bag I\\'ve got these cute little\"\"panda know cards that I\\'m one of you all\"\"sweet people sent me so I\\'m excited to\"\"use those for list making this year and\"\"so yeah doing really well on my blue sky\"\"and all of my pens I really enjoyed\"\"these Stadler pens they last a really\"\"long time do you have a son of the\"\"Statler pens they last a long time and\"\"then update on my gelasa tees these are\"\"pretty awesome I recommend them these\"\"are by BIC I really like the gelasa T\"\"pens they\\'re know that they\\'re to write\"\"with they\\'re similar to the pilot G\"\"tubes they\\'re very similar as far as\"\"their aesthetic and in the type of ink\"\"that flows but I caught him at CVS on\"\"they were on sale and I headed coupons\"\"yeah yeah I saw my apology to color the\"\"colored ones of those that I have I\\'m\"\"all out of but I have I like to write\"\"with the black ones as well so I\\'ve got\"\"some of those but I didn\\'t bring them\"\"with me\"\"I finally filled this out have this\"\"little Mole skiing book here that I keep\"\"addresses in and I just put my p.o box\"\"information on on the front here and it\"\"says as a reward is found sunscreen so\"\"sad I\\'ve had this little booklet for\"\"years and I\\'m finally using it for\"\"something something useful but I just\"\"finished up sending some cute thank-you\"\"cards here\"\"let it snow it\\'s very January theme and\"\"I was able to use here I\\'ll cover my\"\"this person\\'s return address here but I\"\"decorated my um my envelopes with these\"\"cute little snowflake stickers to match\"\"that um I had I was using in my planner\"\"so one thing I\\'ll say about these though\"\"you you got these right and Michael\\'s\"\"snowflake stickers those are from\"\"Oh Hobby Lobby yeah their fYI I mean\"\"they\\'re they\\'re cute but they\\'re not\"\"very good quality for I think they\\'re\"\"called stickability\"\"yeah they\\'re um they\\'re little difficult\"\"to pick pick off of the off of the sheet\"\"if you\\'re into stickers like I am what\"\"are you doing there texting and I just\"\"made myself one of my um my easy breezy\"\"hot chocolates all I do is I nuke some\"\"almond milk in the microwave for about\"\"two minutes and then I mix in a\"\"tablespoon of the Trader Joe\\'s\"\"unsweetened cocoa and - - stevia packets\"\"and some cinnamon and then I add boiling\"\"water to at the top it\\'s quite delicious\"\"so easy and I bet you could also make up\"\"put some not instant coffee in there and\"\"make it like January you got some good\"\"stuff in your sock I sure did I had a\"\"wonderful cause this is one thing that\"\"we got in our stockings this year this\"\"is a sample but the wild foods teas um\"\"this is this is a sample one we got a\"\"biggie pac right yeah have you tried it\"\"yet no I\\'m just thinking no we\"\"definitely need to do that yeah maybe we\"\"should try it this weekend it is it is\"\"what does this flavor over there comes\"\"with a cute little coloring doodle here\"\"Wow\"\"Wow Very Berry antioxidants wild tea\"\"yeah I\\'m looking forward to tasting that\"\"because I like the berry teas you like\"\"the traditional teas to the black and\"\"our ochre yeah you really like Earl Grey\"\"[Music]\"\"well hey guys I just got out of the\"\"shower I ended up going to the gym and\"\"getting a good workout in and I just\"\"took a quick shower I think my mom and I\"\"are gonna watch a movie tonight but I\\'m\"\"doing a sheet mask here kind of what\\'s\"\"going through some of the skincare stuff\"\"that I had from 2017 and this popped up\"\"in my stash this is the let\\'s see yeah I\"\"think the kind folks it may be beauty so\"\"she sent me this yes that is correct\"\"this is the hyaluronic acid mask\"\"concentrated hyaluronic acid moisture\"\"revitalizing firmness it claims by Hera\"\"this is a Korean sheet mask and I am not\"\"entirely sure what the ingredients are\"\"but as with most of the Korean sheet\"\"masks heavy heavy-handed on the\"\"fragrance I can detect that right away\"\"but we shall see how it does I really\"\"like the fit of these that honestly so\"\"that\\'s a plus for but it\\'s it\\'s pretty\"\"heavily fragranced a little eye water\"\"inducing but we\\'ll see how it stacks up\"\"to the cream shop so far those are my\"\"favorite Korean masks but far and away\"\"my favorite sheet masks as I said in my\"\"a skincare favorites of 2017 have to be\"\"those hada labo ones from japan they\\'re\"\"really just just like the hyaluronic\"\"acid some glycerine and no fragrance so\"\"I think they\\'re they\\'re a little better\"\"but anyways masking it right along I\\'m\"\"gonna just let that incubate on there\"\"for oh no 20 minutes while I chitty-chat\"\"with you guys because bringing it back\"\"to you it really what matters I wanted\"\"to chitchat a little bit about the via\"\"derma photo Duramax SPF 50 plus that I\"\"am so that I am going into January on I\"\"suppose this one of you kind folks sent\"\"me from from\"\"Netherlands am I saying that correct\"\"please comment below I hae\"\"mispronouncing things so I always hear\"\"people saying in other lands but that\\'s\"\"not right I can\\'t be right so I think\"\"it\\'s NIT Orleans right Netherlands\"\"sounds right to me\"\"I should have Google Google guest a\"\"guest that before I got on here but\"\"anyways this is a sunscreen from France\"\"and yeah I did a little research on the\"\"ingredients online so I can be sure give\"\"you some accurate information rather\"\"just saying and it feels great\"\"this contains one one filter that I\"\"wanted to talk about it has a really\"\"long name so I didn\\'t write it down here\"\"hon on a cute little little pineapple\"\"post-it note it\\'s this ethyl axial oxy\"\"phenol methoxy phenol triazine which is\"\"essentially a bit much the motrin demo\"\"trigonal which the trade name see this\"\"is why sometimes having trade names is\"\"helpful because who wants to say all\"\"that but the trade name is tennis orb\"\"and tennis or blocks is a filter that\"\"will effectively cover both UVB and UVA\"\"it is very very very photo stabile and\"\"what I mean by photostable oil is that\"\"when exposed to ultraviolet light from\"\"the Sun it remains stable on the skin it\"\"doesn\\'t degrade and so it maintains its\"\"its UV blocking capacity more so over\"\"what is commonly found in many of our\"\"sunscreens here in the US and buys us\"\"UVA protection which is ava Ben\\'s own\"\"okay and furthermore tennis orb is nice\"\"because it it when it\\'s added to others\"\"other other other filters alike Ava\"\"Ben\\'s own it can further stabilize those\"\"so in the present it makes Ava Ben\\'s own\"\"do a little better ok it\\'s kind of like\"\"sound like a tutor or okay for Ava benzo\"\"and it just it just helps it along so in\"\"short you know the European sunscreens\"\"have this ingredient and similar filters\"\"and other sunscreens that are chemical\"\"you know in Japan\"\"it\\'s been approved in Europe since 2000\"\"okay the u.s. is so slow on this\"\"bandwagon it\\'s painful here in the US\"\"you know we have Mex real and like\"\"unlike some of the LA roche-posay stuff\"\"that you can get over the counter which\"\"you know stabilizes a Levin zone to a\"\"certain degree but it\\'s not as fantastic\"\"as the biskits rise all and demet rise\"\"all ingredients I don\\'t know why they\\'ve\"\"taken so long to to get them approved\"\"here and then you add a spot that is\"\"that and another note about this filter\"\"so it\\'s 10 the the trade name is tin\"\"sorb s okay there\\'s also a tennis or\"\"best aqua which I learned about today\"\"tennis or s aqua is basically the tennis\"\"orb in a sort of methyl methacrylate\"\"matrix if you will\"\"dispersion kind of thing which basically\"\"allows it to go into water okay and I\\'m\"\"not sure Bioderma has utilized that I\"\"didn\\'t look into that but I feel as\"\"though it has and the reason that that\\'s\"\"cool is that it allows it to go into\"\"water so it helps you know that the\"\"filter is can can be dispersed in that\"\"in sort of a liquidy form versus here in\"\"the US you know ayiva been zone is\"\"largely oil soluble so a lot of the\"\"chemical sunscreens people complain or\"\"just to oil and make them shiny make\"\"them greasy okay so you know yes\"\"tennis orb as far as a chemical filter\"\"is a little it\\'s superior to do the ones\"\"we have in the u.s. period you know it\\'s\"\"a little bit more stable and it\\'s the\"\"aesthetics of how it can go on and what\"\"it can can do as far as as the vehicle\"\"make it more desirable to consumers okay\"\"so it has a larger consumer appeal and\"\"that\\'s really important because you know\"\"a big big big problem with sunscreens I\"\"mean you know in general is not so much\"\"you know that the filter degrades or\"\"that you know the you know whatever it\\'s\"\"really failure to use okay so that\\'s why\"\"I always tell you guys you\\'re always\"\"like what\\'s the best sunscreen blah blah\"\"blah and what\\'s the one that you like\"\"and use because you know I can\"\"on and on about the different filters\"\"and that sort of thing but you know if\"\"it leaves a white Sheen on your face\"\"you\\'re not gonna want to wear it you\\'re\"\"not gonna run it want to reapply it\\'s\"\"gonna be difficult if it makes you all a\"\"shiny greasy you\\'re not gonna like that\"\"either okay and you know at the end of\"\"the day it has to be something that you\"\"comfortably can put on and and and use\"\"for yourself I really really wish the US\"\"would get this here you know we could\"\"get this here in the u.s. in Japan and\"\"you know Asia they have them in their\"\"sunscreens and so I\\'m very grateful to\"\"you for sending it to me another note\"\"about the Bioderma are just these\"\"sunscreens that contain tennis or but\"\"another note about tennis or that I\"\"don\\'t know maybe you all will find\"\"helpful you know I talked about my\"\"sunscreen QA there\\'s all this fear\"\"around cancer promoting effects of some\"\"of the chemical filters you know in the\"\"laboratory studies if you put a bunch of\"\"like some of our chemical filters on\"\"cells and a dish you know you can see up\"\"regulation and certain estrogen and\"\"related genes and that\\'s like very scary\"\"to people in general you know for\"\"potential breast cancer promoting\"\"properties as I said in that video just\"\"objectively speaking all the long-term\"\"data that we have from from human use\"\"does not support any sort of\"\"cancer-causing promoting of the facts\"\"okay\"\"but you know I\\'m you know I tell you\"\"that that\\'s the objective information\"\"but you know I\\'m Amanda thetic to to the\"\"concern you know if you if you know you\"\"or anybody you know has ever had a\"\"cancer before I mean nobody really I can\"\"totally relate to you not wanting to\"\"wait on the science to parse things out\"\"you know and just that that that slight\"\"tinge of uncertainty I totally relate to\"\"that I\\'m so a note about tennis orb you\"\"know is that unlike the other filters in\"\"those laboratory studies did not show\"\"any estrogen kind of regulating effects\"\"or estrogen dependent gene gene kind of\"\"alterations if you all okay so you know\"\"if that\\'s something that you fear\"\"you know objectively speaking hopefully\"\"the information that I give to give you\"\"maybe can help you make an informed\"\"decision but you know I completely\"\"completely understand still not feeling\"\"comfortable putting it on your face and\"\"wanting to avoid some of these chemical\"\"filters here in the US you know if you\"\"can\\'t you know fly to the Netherlands or\"\"France whatever and get these or Japan\"\"and you you know\"\"Amazon\\'s too expensive for you here in\"\"the US you know you\\'ve gotten zinc and\"\"titanium dioxide and zinc oxide alone is\"\"really pretty good at both UVB and UVA\"\"titanium dioxide is a little less\"\"fantastic at the UVA but they\\'re both\"\"they\\'re both good and you know in\"\"combination they\\'re wonderful\"\"unfortunately they\\'re the ones that are\"\"going to make you look white you know I\"\"have the white film so you know there\\'s\"\"that and so selecting ones that they\"\"have you know micro-sized the the zinc\"\"and titanium dioxide can kind of help\"\"with that\"\"so yeah just a little fun sunscreen\"\"facts and one have you as I pull out the\"\"Bioderma and we head into January with\"\"yet another French sunscreen Bioderma\"\"hopefully I\\'m saying that right I hey\"\"you know I have a real mental block I\"\"practice sign oven all the time like\"\"when you guys are sleeping on the\"\"charger I\\'m like practicing saying that\"\"and I swear soon as the camera turns on\"\"I just like cannot say it correctly and\"\"it drives me nuts when I\\'m editing I\"\"just like want to punch myself drives me\"\"nuts I hate you know I\\'m mispronouncing\"\"things and I just think you know\"\"language is really you know that and\"\"opposable thumbs it\\'s sort of what\"\"separates us from you know Google if you\"\"although Google can pronounce things\"\"better than I can\"\"anyways guys I hope you enjoyed the vlog\"\"I\\'m going to flip this off and probably\"\"rinse off some of the fragrance honestly\"\"maybe and come in with you Sarah be\"\"moisturizing cream\"\"the tub that my mom has this is kind of\"\"her her skincare on when he\\'s I mean\"\"talk about a minimalist this is all\"\"really at my mom has going on in night\"\"time skincare routine I think she just\"\"slathered this all over herself and\"\"calls it done like no mouthing no serum\"\"none of that just just just the tub but\"\"anyways guys I hope you enjoyed the vlog\"\"today if you liked it give it a thumbs\"\"up share it with your friends and as\"\"always don\\'t forget I\\'m screen and\"\"subscribe you guys tomorrow bye\"\"[Music]\"\"hi today I\\'m reviewing the Bioderma\"\"photo derm Max cream and really quick I\"\"just want to say it purchase all these\"\"products with my own money\"\"I\\'ll never waste your time with\"\"sponsored ads or videos so if you want\"\"to help support the channel check out no\"\"BS Beauty comm check out my patreon\"\"community or click on the Amazon link\"\"below okay so finally getting to the\"\"other Bioderma sunscreen i have and now\"\"that i found more sites that I can smell\"\"the products in I\\'m excited I\\'ve got\"\"three more in my cart although I don\\'t\"\"really need three more but I just want\"\"to try them all and they\\'re on sale\"\"so anyway I\\'m really getting good at the\"\"smuggling stuff I don\\'t have to take it\"\"up a notch - maybe like acids maybe\"\"start smuggling in some really good BHA\"\"products I don\\'t know I guess I\\'ll I\\'ll\"\"see what I can move up to in the world\"\"okay so Bioderma calls this a sunscreen\"\"with cellular bio protection patent to\"\"improve skins defenses against the Sun\"\"UVA protection of 42 and UVB protection\"\"of 50 plus and when they talk about UVA\"\"protection of 42 they are going off the\"\"PPD persistent pigment darkening\"\"gradient system and I believe anything\"\"that\\'s a 16 and over is like rated the\"\"best or like PA with four pluses after\"\"it and this one\\'s got 42 so 16 is great\"\"42 is like out of this world which is\"\"amazing okay nourishing cream that is\"\"easy to spread the skin is protecting\"\"hydrated fragrance free non comedogenic\"\"hypoallergenic and water resistant okay\"\"so I get to my first criteria which is\"\"packaging and you know I noticed a lot\"\"of sunscreens come in yellow bottles I\"\"don\\'t know why that is but so many of\"\"them do it just as looking through all\"\"my thumbnails I\\'m like yellow yellow\"\"yellow what ones that one is that anyway\"\"I don\\'t quite get it but I have no\"\"problem with it in terms of denatured or\"\"drying types of alcohol this does not\"\"contain any of those it does contain C\"\"20-22 alcohols which are fatty types of\"\"alcohol which are good or\"\"hydrating foreskin so I don\\'t know so\"\"many of these alcohols contain a lot of\"\"alcohol but Bioderma to figure out how\"\"to do it without it\"\"so what are they doing or what do they\"\"know that all these other brands don\\'t I\"\"don\\'t know they know something okay so I\"\"get to fragrance and there\\'s no\"\"fragrance ingredients although it has a\"\"very very mild almost like corn smell\"\"like it smells a little bit like corn\"\"but it goes away pretty quickly I don\\'t\"\"know how else describe maybe cornbread\"\"just a very light almost barely\"\"noticeable scent my nose is very\"\"sensitive though so I don\\'t know but\"\"it\\'s not bad doesn\\'t bother me so the\"\"manufacturing location for this one is\"\"France so no issues with that SPF on\"\"this one is 50 plus and since made in\"\"France they are only allowed to go up to\"\"50 so anything with a 50 plus indicates\"\"really good coverage probably 60 or\"\"above from what I\\'m hearing from you\"\"guys so it\\'s pretty impressive\"\"protection from UVB rays then we get to\"\"the UVA protection factor and this one\"\"is excellent far far above average this\"\"has like a plus plus UVA protection the\"\"PPD level is 42 or PPD number anything\"\"over 20 on the PPD number is considered\"\"awesome great excellent 16 above is\"\"passing I guess so the protection of\"\"this one is just ridiculously high which\"\"makes a great option for those who spend\"\"a lot of time outside those who have\"\"significant hyperpigmentation issues\"\"those who have a history of skin cancer\"\"makes the bio during some sunscreens a\"\"really great option so they have done an\"\"amazing job with their photo derm line\"\"I\\'ve been impressed with both of them\"\"now I\\'m gonna be buying more so ok the\"\"filters used for this one we\\'ve got you\"\"v\\'l n 539 which is also known as octo\"\"cry lean which is an oil soluble\"\"chemical sunscreen agent which protects\"\"skin in the UVB range and somewhat in\"\"the UVA range and it\\'s also one that\"\"helps evil bends on be a bit more stable\"\"more effective and it\\'s also one that\"\"people can have a lot of allergies to I\"\"think it\\'s one of the more common\"\"ingredients where people are reporting\"\"side effects or allergies from it so\"\"keep that one in mind\"\"then we\\'ve got tin sorb M which is a\"\"hybrid filter that both reflects and\"\"absorbs both UVB and UVA rays which is\"\"impressive\"\"then we\\'ve got Evo Ben\\'s own there we go\"\"the UVA reabsorb ER and then tensor s\"\"filter a very photostable filter which\"\"absorbs both UVB and UVA rays so a\"\"pretty good impressive lineup of filters\"\"that they\\'ve used then we get to white\"\"cast and um I\\'m kind of impressed with\"\"this one so they\\'re plies pretty nicely\"\"there\\'s a very very mild white cast I\"\"know right now it looks pretty blinding\"\"but once it absorbs it\\'s more mild so\"\"not super super noticeable and the more\"\"it absorbs into skin the less it looks\"\"but it is a mild very mild white cast\"\"and how the longer you wear it the less\"\"its noticeable but if you\\'re gonna\"\"reapply it that also becomes a bit more\"\"of an issue because the white cast\"\"you\\'re playing over foundation and\"\"things like that so we\\'ll talk more\"\"about reapplying things and half and you\"\"have to do it during the live stream but\"\"anyway once it absorbs the white cast is\"\"very very mild not super noticeable then\"\"we\\'ve got texture which it\\'s got kind of\"\"a lotion aid cream texture to it which\"\"absorbs pretty quickly once you smooth\"\"it in once it absorbs though it sets to\"\"kind of a sticky and tacky finish it\\'s\"\"almost like it doesn\\'t fully feel like\"\"it dries down so if you apply foundation\"\"over it it\\'s not gonna be as big of a\"\"deal but it is very slightly tacky and\"\"kind of sticky not as bad as some other\"\"ones I\\'ve tried like the drunk elephant\"\"sunscreens those are always super\"\"to me but it is slightly sticky and\"\"tacky and I would say the finish for\"\"this one is slightly radiant if you like\"\"a matte finish their photo fluid while I\"\"reviewed is kind of a better option but\"\"this one sets to kind of a more natural\"\"radiant finish which is slightly sticky\"\"so not the worst not the best but pretty\"\"decent still overall then we get to\"\"ease-of-use and it does take a bit of\"\"smoothing and effort to really apply it\"\"and to get it to smooth over evenly\"\"takes a bit of effort the texture is\"\"rather hydrating so this works better my\"\"opinion if you apply it directly over a\"\"serum instead of using like you\"\"typically in the morning I\\'ll use a\"\"essence then a serum and then a\"\"moisturizer and then my sunscreen this\"\"one works better if you just eliminate\"\"the moisturizer step and just apply it\"\"directly over a serum just because it is\"\"rather hydrating seems to feel like it\"\"creates a bit of a seal over skin which\"\"is probably because the water resistance\"\"so it can be a bit fussy to apply\"\"certain foundations over them usually\"\"foundations that are rather hydrating or\"\"amoliant can be a bit iffy to apply over\"\"and then foundations that are super\"\"matte can also be a bit tricky but\"\"overall it\\'s still pretty easy to use\"\"it\\'s just not dummy-proof which is\"\"probably why it took me a month to\"\"figure it out no I\\'m just kidding haha\"\"I\\'m so funny I really can be funny when\"\"I try though so anyway okay\"\"antioxidants and beneficial ingredients\"\"in this one but a lot of hydrating and\"\"moisturizing ingredients a lot of slip\"\"ingredients in this one we\\'ve also got a\"\"few good ingredients we\\'ve got mannitol\"\"xylitol fructooligosaccharides which are\"\"great hydrating and moisturizing\"\"ingredients then we\\'ve got Ram nose ROM\"\"nose which is a ingredient which has\"\"demonstrated positive effects in both\"\"epidermal and dermal compartments of\"\"in-vitro reconstructed skin moreover\"\"such in vitro findings were obtained\"\"that has an effect on collagen four and\"\"pro-collagen one per day\"\"action so that\\'s great for skin then\"\"we\\'ve got a ingredient which is known\"\"abroad which is a brown seaweed known as\"\"antelope kine\"\"6 I\\'m sure I slaughtered the name of\"\"that it\\'s an ingredient that helps\"\"protect skin from oxidative stress\"\"caused by over exposure to sunlight so\"\"that makes it a natural fit for a\"\"sunscreen it\\'s also rich in plant\"\"sterols that support the skin in a wide\"\"range of ways and then we\\'ve got act\"\"eine which is an ingredient that helps\"\"protect the skin from environmental\"\"stressors such as natural item\"\"pollutants so we don\\'t have a super long\"\"list of antioxidants and beneficial\"\"ingredients but we do have some AB note\"\"and a lot of ammonia ingredients so\"\"overall I was kind of impressed with it\"\"I don\\'t know at least some of the\"\"ingredients that they included as\"\"beneficial ingredients actually play\"\"directly to a sunscreen instead of just\"\"some random things so I don\\'t know\"\"overall I was happy with it then we\\'ve\"\"got acne genic ingredients and this\"\"surprised me because it does have a bit\"\"of a thicker creamy texture to it but it\"\"only has one ingredient of note for acne\"\"prone skin which is paid 100 stearate\"\"which is a slightly comedogenic\"\"ingredient but that\\'s it so overall I\"\"was pretty impressed with that so if you\"\"have acne prone skin this is a great\"\"option and there\\'s not a lot of really\"\"great options out there so this is a\"\"good one then we get to animal testing\"\"and unfortunately Bioderma is not\"\"cruelty free which I always every time I\"\"review a product if there\\'s I was up to\"\"Google cuz I was thinking the back of my\"\"head they are but they\\'re not so that\\'s\"\"important to note there we get to\"\"performance and this one will absolutely\"\"highly protect your skin from sun damage\"\"from uva and UVB rays highly protect\"\"your skin like very good protection\"\"lasts pretty well throughout the day it\"\"can become a little bit greasy towards\"\"the very end of the day after 8 or 9\"\"hours of wear it can start to look a\"\"little shiny but not tear\"\"believe so overall I was pretty\"\"impressed with this sunscreen for so\"\"many reasons high protection several\"\"unique beneficial ingredients great for\"\"acne prone skin well packaged well\"\"formulated so overall I was more\"\"impressed than not so then we get to the\"\"price and this is the full size which is\"\"1.33 ounces 40 milliliters which is a\"\"bit tinier than most other sunscreens\"\"also in a retails for about $24 making\"\"it 60 cents a milliliter making it a bit\"\"more expensive per milliliter than a lot\"\"of other sunscreens I\\'ve reviewed but\"\"it\\'s still rather affordable for\"\"something that\\'s so effective so overall\"\"with a 15 being a perfect score this one\"\"got a 14 which is pretty darn good yeah\"\"so anyway I\\'m interested in hearing from\"\"you guys if you\\'ve had a chance to try\"\"this one out and if you have what your\"\"thoughts are or if you\\'ve tried in the\"\"other Bioderma sunscreens out what have\"\"you tried and how have you liked it so\"\"leave a comment I love hearing from you\"\"guys be sure to join us on our\"\"livestream May 2nd at 2 p.m. Central\"\"Time and thank you guys so much\"\"hey everyone its Michelle welcome back\"\"to my channel in today\\'s video I am\"\"finally doing another sunscreen Sunday\"\"and it\\'s on one of my favorite sunscreen\"\"finds this year and that is the biodome\"\"or photo durham SPF 50 plus milk high\"\"protection sunscreen I\\'m actually almost\"\"finished this sunscreen and I figured\"\"it\\'s about time that I do a review on\"\"this before I fully run out of this\"\"product\"\"it says the photo derm milk SPF 50 plus\"\"offers a large spectrum protection\"\"against some harmful ultraviolet rays of\"\"the Sun it\\'s anti UVA UVB filter system\"\"and it\\'s exclusive formula provide a\"\"scientifically proved high protection\"\"non-comedogenic will not clog pores\"\"other claims based on the Bioderma\"\"canada website when i last looked at it\"\"or that it\\'s suitable for babies\"\"children teens adult for the face and\"\"body smooth texture colourless upon\"\"application no greasy effect no white\"\"traces a uva of 42 and i actually got\"\"that from the Shoppers Drug Mart website\"\"that it\\'s a UVA but 42 fragrance free\"\"paraben free hyper allergenic\"\"and moisturizing I purchased this for\"\"twenty seven ninety Canadian dollars\"\"this comes in a hundred mil tube and I\"\"picked this up at Shoppers Drug Mart\"\"it\\'s an all chemical sunscreen and the\"\"filters are one of the main reasons why\"\"this is in my top sunscreen pics of the\"\"year it has 10% Arctic raylene 6% tina\"\"sorb m 5% April been zone and 2.5% Tina\"\"sorb s we\\'ve all heard of Australian and\"\"AVO been Zone in Western sunscreens but\"\"the fact that it has both Tina sorb M &\"\"S which are very photo stable filters\"\"that have very good UVA protection and\"\"the fact that you could purchase this so\"\"easily over the counter at your local\"\"shoppers Drug Mart or a rec hall is\"\"incredible as you can hear this is quite\"\"a liquidy sunscreen and it comes in a\"\"tube packaging and again I don\\'t like\"\"the packaging for as you can see that\"\"buildup is nasty here\\'s the swatch on my\"\"hand as you can see it\\'s a bit of like a\"\"thick lotion type of texture because it\"\"is still running down my hand although\"\"very slowly now I\\'m just gonna rub it\"\"into my hand now as you can see it\\'s\"\"very smooth like this actually doesn\\'t\"\"feel thick at all it feels really nice\"\"and light it\\'s also making my hand feel\"\"slightly more moisturize now I didn\\'t\"\"rub this in\"\"well enough but as you can see there is\"\"a slight cast on this hand here compared\"\"to my hand without the sunscreen and I\\'m\"\"just gonna rub it in a little bit more\"\"and keep in mind this is still like on\"\"initial application so it doesn\\'t look\"\"ask caste now compared to my hand\"\"without it and it actually makes my skin\"\"look more even tone definitely shinier\"\"on this side as well but definitely more\"\"moisturized on this hand as for\"\"fragrance it\\'s not noticeable at all\"\"unless you actually actively go like\"\"this and even then I can\\'t describe what\"\"the scent is it\\'s not unpleasant it\\'s\"\"not overly industrial chemically\"\"smelling I would say there is like maybe\"\"a slight sour type of smell to it but it\"\"doesn\\'t smell rotten or anything like\"\"that but again it\\'s not a noticeable\"\"scent at all when I apply it on my face\"\"when I apply it on my face I actually\"\"try to apply it in two separate layers\"\"and I find by doing this it glides on\"\"the skin it very easily and it feels\"\"nice and light and as you can see on\"\"initial application there looks like\"\"there\\'s a cast going on but as you can\"\"see in the clip 10 to 15 minutes later\"\"the cast subsided and I actually noticed\"\"the undertone in my skin still after\"\"waiting in the 10 to 15 minutes I\"\"definitely noticed my skin looks a lot\"\"shinier but it also looks a bit more\"\"even tone in terms of the feel it almost\"\"feels like I added an extra moisturizer\"\"on to my skin but this is definitely not\"\"as rich as the Bioderma outer derm\"\"intensive balm that I use that one is\"\"very rich whereas this one it feels like\"\"it just leaves a nice moisturized layer\"\"on top of the skin this hasn\\'t a\"\"waterproof claims on the packaging here\"\"it says apply generously prior to sun\"\"exposure\"\"reapply as needed or after swimming\"\"towel drying perspiring heavily and\"\"washing for extra skin benefits like I\"\"mentioned prior in terms of the feel it\"\"does feel like this adds a little bit\"\"extra moisture to my skin but one of the\"\"bigger skin benefits I\\'ve noticed when\"\"using this sunscreen is that my\"\"pigmentation has faded significantly in\"\"my current skincare routine I am using\"\"azelaic acid and different and I find\"\"both of those in my routine have\"\"actually helped lighten any pigmentation\"\"I have on my face but in the summertime\"\"I do freckle a lot and actually on the\"\"top part of my cheeks right here I am\"\"noticing some residual pigmentation and\"\"for the women in my family I\\'ve noticed\"\"this is the spot right here where they\"\"have received age spot\"\"but while using this in this some are\"\"actually noticed this never darkened at\"\"all and I never even got any freckles\"\"and usually all the freckles are around\"\"my nose and I haven\\'t seen any this year\"\"this is an uneducated guess but my\"\"assumption is because there is some\"\"silicone in this product and it does\"\"make my skin look smoother and I also\"\"don\\'t find this emphasizes any texture\"\"on my skin at all especially my large\"\"pores right here and on my forehead I\"\"find that texture never comes to the\"\"forefront when I use this foundation if\"\"anything it looks slightly subsided not\"\"blurring but subsided in terms of makeup\"\"in the summertime what I did was mostly\"\"mix a primer with that drunk elephant D\"\"bronzy just to give myself a little bit\"\"of a tint right now I am wearing this\"\"product underneath the foundation I am\"\"wearing Mac Studio sculpt foundation in\"\"the color NC 20 did n\\'t go in with my\"\"touch of primer I just went in right\"\"away with the foundation after waiting\"\"the 10 to 15 minutes and powdered a\"\"little bit in my t-zone and I really\"\"like how my skin looks right now\"\"I believe I have tried the it cosmetics\"\"CC cream with this product as well and I\"\"never noticed it disrupting my makeup at\"\"all so for the overall pros for the\"\"sunscreen first point is the high UVA\"\"protection this is formulated with some\"\"highly sought after photo stable filters\"\"that is not easily found in the Western\"\"market especially for those of you that\"\"live in the u.s. so for those of us that\"\"are Canadian or live close to the\"\"Canadian border this is very easy to get\"\"at a local Rexel or Shoppers Drug Mart\"\"store also another pro is I find it a\"\"great amount for the price I mean 100\"\"mils for less than $30 is really good\"\"they have this product and one of those\"\"large spray bottles so I don\\'t know if\"\"the formula is slightly different from\"\"this so I was thinking of checking that\"\"out just because it comes in a larger\"\"amount I also like that I can use this\"\"both on my face and body I don\\'t find\"\"this a greasy product at all despite its\"\"moisturizing effect and another pro is\"\"actually that despite it being an all\"\"chemical sunscreen this does not sting\"\"my eyes at all one of the biggest cons\"\"for this products like I mentioned is\"\"the fact that it can produce a cast\"\"although today it looked like it didn\\'t\"\"give me that much of a cast for good\"\"measure I still like going in with some\"\"type of complexion makeup product I feel\"\"like even with the sheer foundation the\"\"cast on this is still fairly easy to\"\"cover another con and it kind of depends\"\"on what your skin type is like but this\"\"does\"\"use quite a bit of shine not just my\"\"face on my body as well so for those of\"\"you that are oily skin and tend to stay\"\"away from shinier products just keep in\"\"mind when you use this I would say a\"\"better option for those of you with oily\"\"skin for a high SPF and you be a\"\"protecting product is the LA roche-posay\"\"Anthelios lotion not the one that\\'s\"\"tinted but the regular one that one is\"\"an all chemical filter sunscreen and I\"\"find it does produce a bit more of a\"\"matte finish so I think you\\'d like that\"\"better than this one overall despite the\"\"cast and the shine it gives this\"\"sunscreen has been one of my favorite\"\"sunscreens to date and you\\'ll definitely\"\"be seeing this in my best of beauty\"\"skincare Edition around up and that is\"\"it for this sunscreen Sunday I do hope\"\"you found this video helpful and\"\"informative if you did please be sure to\"\"give this video a like subscribe to my\"\"channel down below for future videos\"\"leave a comment if you have any\"\"questions or recommendations and I\\'ll\"\"see you all

      "\"hello guys and welcome to my channel my\"\"name is Jesper fussing and today we are\"\"going to look at a sunscreen and we're\"\"going to do at one of these those tinted\"\"ones and what you would like to know is\"\"how does it actually look color wise\"\"so we're firstly the one we are talking\"\"about today is the one from Bioderma and\"\"it looks like this and the embellish\"\"looks like this or the packaging looks\"\"like this and first of all yes you would\"\"like to know what is the SPF and that is\"\"a 50 a plus on this one here and it says\"\"that it has the UVA in a circle and\"\"actually it was so difficult to see it I\"\"couldn't really find it on the tube\"\"itself but when I looked at the\"\"packaging I could see that down here it\"\"says that it has the UVA in a circle so\"\"that means that it is at least a 1/3 UVA\"\"compared to the UVB so compared to the\"\"SPF now one other thing is that normally\"\"I like to use well that's not quite true\"\"because the one I use does not have any\"\"star ratings on it and that is the one\"\"from La Roche Posay dia on tinted\"\"version but it is a good idea if you can\"\"find something with this star rating on\"\"it and if you have at least a 4 to 5\"\"stars and that is something I would use\"\"if I went to the beach or if I knew I\"\"had to be out in the Sun for a long time\"\"but just for daily use I use the one\"\"from La Roche Posay which is with a UV\"\"in a circle but it doesn't have any a\"\"star rating now this one here has the UV\"\"inner circle but I know star rating so\"\"we can't really talk about that and what\"\"you would like to know is how is the\"\"color well if you look at how are they\"\"making the colours in this sort of\"\"products then when they have attended\"\"version and the LA roche-posay us that\"\"had a has a tinted version and the\"\"Bioderma has a tinted aversion and other\"\"companies has tinted versions as well\"\"but for those three that i mentioned\"\"they are using\"\"something called iron oxides and they\"\"are using a yellow oxide a red and a\"\"black oxide and then they are using it\"\"to tenem oxide as well the titanium\"\"oxide is what will give you the sun\"\"protection or what would be the sun\"\"screen itself but this one here has a\"\"chemical filters in it as well as the\"\"event one is a purely a mineral\"\"sunscreen so why do I mention the\"\"titanium oxide well I do that because it\"\"is very white and that is obviously\"\"something that they are also using in\"\"order to lighten the color of a product\"\"so it's not so dark also it comes up to\"\"the color that they wanted because when\"\"I just said so is not so dark well the\"\"whole thing about these tinted\"\"moisturizers hood tinted sunscreen as\"\"these ones are is that it it's almost\"\"sort of like one color is supposed to\"\"fit all and I think we all know that one\"\"color certainly does not fit all\"\"so for sunscreens that I attended it\"\"should be just like for makeup so for\"\"foundations and a lot of companies are\"\"really good at that now and some\"\"companies are not that good and I would\"\"say that if you are still making a\"\"sunscreen which is a one color fits or\"\"maybe you have not really understood the\"\"message so we are reviewing this one\"\"anyway so what I would say about the\"\"iron oxide is that the difference is\"\"that in this one here and the one from\"\"even then the first ingredients of the\"\"oxides so as they are listed in the\"\"ingredients list is the yellow oxide and\"\"that means yellow iron oxide and that\"\"means of course that that product is a\"\"little bit more oranjee whereas the one\"\"from the hospice aid that is so that the\"\"red iron oxide is listed first so there\"\"is more red iron oxide in the one from a\"\"large person and there are in the ones\"\"from oven and from a higher term\"\"and that you can already think gives a\"\"sort of a difference in how the color is\"\"is more red or is it more orange II and\"\"then they also have a black iron oxide\"\"in it in order to make it more well\"\"darker so it is obviously the mix about\"\"for those iron oxide that are making up\"\"at a color so kind of like if you are\"\"looking at a product you can read from\"\"an ingredients list if they have the\"\"yellow iron oxide listed above the red\"\"iron oxide then it is more to the orange\"\"side and vice versa it would be more red\"\"and I would say that the brown from LA\"\"roche-posay is a it is red it is not\"\"orange II I would say it it comes across\"\"as being too red so yes should we try\"\"this one here and as I always say just\"\"take something out and this one you can\"\"sign it's a big liquidy so it's not\"\"kinda like super fatty it's more like\"\"liquidy and I think they are actually\"\"saying that it is now it says in French\"\"maybe it says an image and it says aqua\"\"fluid tante tres odor protection\"\"protection is it Spanish as French I\"\"don't really do French I just try my\"\"best but it tended aqua fluid very high\"\"air protection that's the English\"\"version for you that so sell it our bio\"\"protection I mean what you like to know\"\"is the color so let's have a look so you\"\"can just see it is kind of like really\"\"liquidy so kinda like Crips out of there\"\"this one here and it really looks like\"\"well something it looks like a makeup\"\"cream very good makeup cream and it\"\"maybe if you can see the color compared\"\"to my skin my skin is definitely not a\"\"tent at the moment because I am\"\"basically staying indoors due to the\"\"situation that we are all in so I don't\"\"have that much Sun and also means that I\"\"actually not used a sunscreen for a long\"\"time because I am basically indoors\"\"every day so how does it look it's very\"\"very liquid is very easy to distribute\"\"so it has this sort of a column but what\"\"our lightest show is that a lot of\"\"people they are using so little\"\"sunscreen so where this one here has the\"\"same weight as the one from the wash per\"\"se and when I use the one from the\"\"hospice a I know I need to use half a\"\"teaspoon of the teaspoons that I have\"\"your teaspoon might look a different\"\"might be small that might be bigger so I\"\"just have measured and you can see a\"\"video about that up there I will link to\"\"that one how to find out how much\"\"sunscreen to actually use so that for me\"\"would be kind of like half a of these\"\"teaspoons here so now you can maybe\"\"already see that them if I maybe can\"\"tilt it is very liquid about trying it a\"\"little bit you can maybe see how it\"\"looks how much it is and that is for my\"\"entire face and when I put it into my\"\"hand I have to remember that a lot of\"\"the cream will stick in my hand so\"\"basically it is better just to dip my\"\"finger in and then go along and then do\"\"it like that\"\"now I'm only doing one side I only have\"\"to use half of the amount but you can\"\"already see it gives kind of a big\"\"splash so this will just go on here and\"\"you can see that it will definitely\"\"change the color of my face so you will\"\"see that this side by its on and this I\"\"don't have anything on today I only have\"\"a summer setting powder on I don't have\"\"any foundation on or something like that\"\"so it is just sitting about a little bit\"\"of a highlight not to look at too tall\"\"on camera so this is a kind of like how\"\"it will look and yes I can smear it out\"\"and smeared out and smeared and continue\"\"to smear it out and a lot of it will be\"\"taken up by my hands but that was not\"\"the point the point was that I need to\"\"leave it on the skin because it\"\"is there for a certain purpose and that\"\"is in order to protect me from the Sun\"\"so when as you can see this is rather a\"\"lot of stuff to put on and just put it\"\"on my forehead so it is I mean one thing\"\"to say is that it is very easy to\"\"distribute it really easy to distribute\"\"it's very liquidy and so on I don't we\"\"don't want Maya to put this so I put it\"\"there so don't want to have it all over\"\"the place but yeah how do I think the\"\"color is when I see it directly and not\"\"through the camera where I know that the\"\"color would be a little bit different\"\"but I would say it definitely is not as\"\"orangie or it's not as red as the LA\"\"roche-posay one so and it's not as when\"\"I spoke about the event mineral one I\"\"compared it to a chocolate ice cream\"\"that I had as a child and which was kind\"\"of like um can I get grayish undertone\"\"into the brown where I would definitely\"\"not say that\"\"this is like that so I would say this is\"\"maybe color wise if you can maybe still\"\"see it this is kind of like I'm\"\"something in-between the one from our\"\"then and the one from LA roche-posay but\"\"um yeah I mean the other thing to\"\"remember about these things here is that\"\"they will actually act a little bit like\"\"a foundation and when you are putting\"\"foundation on you will use a setting\"\"spray or you can use a setting powder\"\"afterwards and I would say that that is\"\"exactly the same that you need to do\"\"when using something like this because\"\"what happens is that I had it on my face\"\"for several hours at the other day and\"\"what very quickly happened was that it\"\"started to run into the crease lines\"\"around lines you get around the nose\"\"when you're moving your face so it very\"\"quickly went in there and I mean on\"\"camera it would have looked nice but in\"\"reality when people looked up close they\"\"would be able to see that it all seeped\"\"into all the\"\"lines in one's face all the Mickey lines\"\"that you get did it I know in my eyes\"\"well not to begin with it took a little\"\"while I would say it took maybe a couple\"\"of hours and I did actually put it on\"\"very liberal on my eyelids and it did as\"\"in other lines on the face in the\"\"creased line on the eyelid it it very\"\"soon just ended up being a read a line\"\"as their so yes again that you wouldn't\"\"have needed to use some sort of a\"\"setting powder in order to keep it a\"\"fixed so we didn't or my eyes yes it did\"\"annoy my eyes after a couple of hours\"\"and I felt I just needed to take it away\"\"and in order I thought maybe it's just\"\"because my eyes are limpid dry or\"\"whatever but then as soon as I took it\"\"off and it was in the evening when I\"\"took it off so it was not like okay it\"\"has been a long day\"\"my eyes are tired and so on because as\"\"soon as I took it off and I don't\"\"normally have it like that when I don't\"\"have a sunscreen so I immediately I took\"\"it off and I didn't have that annoying\"\"feeling any longer\"\"so clearly it was the sunscreen that\"\"annoyed my eyes and I would say with the\"\"LA roche-posay one I used the untainted\"\"one and it has never annoyed my eyes and\"\"they do say that I'd use some sort of a\"\"anti i sting technology and I'm not\"\"saying that that works really well and I\"\"wouldn't say it does not leave any sort\"\"of a cast on the face so if you would\"\"like to have a sunscreen that doesn't\"\"leave a cast on your face I would say\"\"that the amount from a large per se is a\"\"really good choice for many reasons and\"\"this stuff here I will say that it's not\"\"as bad as the event one which started to\"\"really like burn around my eyes on the\"\"eyelids around this very the eyes the\"\"the area underneath my eye it started to\"\"warm and get the sort of burning\"\"sensation that just became worse and\"\"worse and worse I did not have it with\"\"this one here to the same degree as I\"\"had with the event one of us just like a\"\"little\"\"it but it it wasn't that much I know my\"\"eyes it was more like receiving into my\"\"eyes and annoyed the eye itself so yes\"\"this is how it looks and is it something\"\"I will use no it is not and it feels\"\"another thing to say is that it feels\"\"crazy it's easy to distribute on your\"\"face but it just has this drawback that\"\"it's it's it's really crazy and it keeps\"\"being greasy and there when I looked in\"\"the mirror when I was outside it really\"\"did shine to high heaven so it really\"\"looked really glossy so yes this is not\"\"something I can recommend but if you\"\"can't help yourself but wanting to try\"\"it try it out see how the color works\"\"and let me know it works for you if you\"\"would like to see more the sort of\"\"videos please subscribe in Tibetan to\"\"all those things to know to be notified\"\"when I put more disabilities thank you\"\"for watching see you bye\"\"hi I'm Melina cop the pimple calm and\"\"today I want to talk to you about\"\"once again my favorite brand that\"\"doesn't pay me for these videos yes I'm\"\"not sponsored by this friend but I love\"\"them so much that I will shout my love\"\"for them from the rooftops every day I\"\"mean seriously I have converted so many\"\"people onto this brand that it's not\"\"even funny\"\"today I'm talking about bio derma and\"\"specifically since you know I am like\"\"the biggest a sunscreen fan ever like as\"\"in I intend to look 19 for the rest of\"\"my life the reason that I can look 19\"\"for the rest of my life like the one\"\"thing that allows me to do that is\"\"sunscreen and so today I'm going to be\"\"talking about the Bioderma\"\"photo derm range of sunscreens so\"\"Bioderma has many different ranges they\"\"have ranges for sensitive skin the sense\"\"of bio range they have ranges for\"\"dehydrated skin and the Hydra bio range\"\"they have a range for acne prone skin\"\"the sebum range and they have the photo\"\"derm range it's the orange one this\"\"range is amazing because it's sunscreen\"\"and the thing that I love about Bioderma\"\"they provide broad-spectrum protection\"\"and they are often you know fragrance\"\"free and water resistance and these are\"\"things that you want to look for in a\"\"sunscreen in order to get adequate\"\"protection it's really really important\"\"that you wear your sunscreen\"\"you should watch my sunscreen video to\"\"learn more about you know the difference\"\"between chemical and mineral sunscreens\"\"and all the rest of it basically there\"\"is no better one as long as you wear\"\"sunscreen that's good the best sunscreen\"\"is the sunscreen that you actually put\"\"on your face the best sunscreen is the\"\"sunscreen that protects you but I mean\"\"there are brands out there that are\"\"terrible that don't actually live up to\"\"their labels like Neutrogena so I do not\"\"use brands in you know the typical\"\"sunscreen aisle\"\"in the like a big store like Walmart I\"\"don't know I only used sunscreens from\"\"two brands ok Bioderma or polish choice\"\"that's it I am like very elitist with my\"\"sunscreen it has to be the best the best\"\"the best the best because as you know\"\"many sunscreens clog your pores and for\"\"me being you know skin health coach it\"\"would kind of be a little weird if I was\"\"using products that clogged my skin and\"\"many sunscreens in like natural skincare\"\"ranges contains so many different kinds\"\"of oils that they I don't know how they\"\"even protect the skin from the Sun given\"\"that a lot of them have oils high up on\"\"the ingredient list that you know oils\"\"kind of attract the Sun as opposed to\"\"repel the sun's on oil based sunscreen\"\"and no idea how that works from a\"\"chemical perspective but I know what it\"\"does so on a poor level it clogs it\"\"clogs it clogs your pores so I have all\"\"of these sunscreens from Bioderma and\"\"I'm gonna include the Hydra bio SPF 30\"\"in this because it is a very very good\"\"but if you want to hear about my review\"\"on this and watch the Hydra bio range\"\"video because this is an amazing a\"\"little everyday sunscreen so ok let's\"\"begin with me be the body sunscreen\"\"because many of us forget that our body\"\"actually tends under the clothes as well\"\"especially you know in the summer when\"\"the Sun is so bright and so high\"\"especially depending on where you are in\"\"the world you know you can really cause\"\"some real damage and you don't want to\"\"just protect your face your whole body\"\"kind of matters you know and I think\"\"it's very important to wear sun\"\"protection liberally on your whole body\"\"in the summer and I love this because\"\"look how huge it is it is 400\"\"milliliters of spray sunscreen so you\"\"can kind of get to hard-to-reach places\"\"by spraying it I warn you this nozzle is\"\"very very strong this is SPF 50 photo\"\"derm max but it depends on where you are\"\"in the world because I believe in Canada\"\"they only have SPF 40 in this size and\"\"in this product so Bioderma\"\"is available literally all around the\"\"world that's what I love about them\"\"that's why I choose by odor mites I\"\"pretty much can find it in any pharmacy\"\"around of the world so I love how\"\"accessible it is and I love how well\"\"formulated the products are and I love\"\"that they're broad-spectrum protection\"\"so you get UVA protection as well this\"\"one it does have an invisible texture\"\"even though it comes out white and it\"\"spreads very easily so I really like it\"\"but my favorite thing is like how big it\"\"is\"\"well how much sunscreen I get Bioderma\"\"products are really well priced for what\"\"they are for another one that covers the\"\"body but can also work on the face this\"\"is the photo derm sensitive SPF 50 this\"\"is literally probably the highest\"\"protection you can get because it has\"\"very high UVA protection\"\"it's almost as high as the UVB\"\"protection here and what I love about\"\"Bioderma sunscreens is that they often\"\"will put the actual UVA rating as well\"\"as the UVB rating but they only do this\"\"in Europe keep that in mind because the\"\"rating system hasn't been universally\"\"agreed upon yet around the world so like\"\"Asia has their own rating system europe\"\"has their own rating system the US\"\"doesn't have a rating system the FDA is\"\"trying to figure that out now but Europe\"\"is more stringent on ingredients there\"\"really like on top of their I really\"\"like that they actually you know do a\"\"rating system and it kind of allows you\"\"to know like this sunscreens has better\"\"broad-spectrum protection then this\"\"sunscreen you know the rating system\"\"does help because some sunscreens have\"\"like a UVA rating of you know 20 some 30\"\"some 40 and so I choose the highest\"\"possible UVA protection because UVA rays\"\"are the ones that are going to jack up\"\"your collagen make your pores weak and\"\"saggy and more prone to acne so I'm like\"\"you no no no no thank you no thank you\"\"this is a thicker product its extreme\"\"milk very high protection photosensitive\"\"skin water resistance and without\"\"fragrance and it's without parabens for\"\"those people who are afraid of paraben\"\"all the bio dermis and\"\"means our without parabens and you do\"\"either without fragrance I believe as\"\"well as far as I can see yep fragrance\"\"for me very very good product this one\"\"you can use on your body for like\"\"extremely high protection this is for\"\"those people who you know burn at the\"\"slightest bit of the Sun amazing amazing\"\"protection or like if you're out on the\"\"beach where the highest protection\"\"possible like do it you know and try\"\"obviously to protect yourself like an\"\"umbrella out some protective clothing\"\"hats sunglasses so that you're not\"\"burning your skin like it's just not a\"\"good idea that tans are stupid\"\"get some self-tanner get a fake tan\"\"that's what I do take down and I've used\"\"this on both the face and the body it's\"\"thick on the face but still does an\"\"amazing job this is something I would\"\"wear if I'm literally out in the Sun\"\"which is something I tried to avoid\"\"doing but if like I'm at the beach and\"\"this is the sunscreen I'll probably be\"\"using on my face I also have this one\"\"this is a photo Duramax SPF 100 I'm not\"\"sure that this is even available in\"\"North America because in North America I\"\"believe that anything above an SPF 50 is\"\"not sold and it's not that it's not sold\"\"because it doesn't work or whatever it's\"\"just that this is what happens with SPF\"\"SPF 30 protects you from 97% of the race\"\"so 3% still get in SPF 70 protects you\"\"from 98% of the race so you know\"\"anything above an SPF 50 is kind of\"\"almost the same as an SPF 50 but when I\"\"got this product I think I didn't see\"\"anything else so I'm like I'm just\"\"taking it and this is very high\"\"protection for a sensitive skin and it's\"\"a fluid texture so the texture is very\"\"light but I do find it can ball up on\"\"top of certain things so with some\"\"screens you might find that if you use\"\"like a silicone\"\"product underneath things your sunscreen\"\"might fall up and it's just a matter of\"\"experimenting to find like the perfect\"\"combination of products that work\"\"together that don't make the sunscreen\"\"fall up but what I do with this one in\"\"particular is I wear it on my morning\"\"I just simply washed my face and without\"\"anything on my face on my dry face I\"\"applied this sunscreen go for a run come\"\"back wash it off and then do the rest of\"\"my skincare routine I don't wear SPF 100\"\"every single day but what I do do is I\"\"wear do you do I wear SPF 30 every\"\"single day a minimum of SPF 30 but I do\"\"wear SPF 50 when I'm out kind of more\"\"like out and about when I know I'll be\"\"leaving the house I'm definitely wearing\"\"SPF 50 if it's summer it's gonna be\"\"definitely SPF 50\"\"I do SPF 30 minimum let's say spring\"\"winter you know when I don't see so much\"\"Sun but in the summer spring on days\"\"when I'm out SPF 50 is when I aim for it\"\"because I want to get maximum protection\"\"now speaking of SPF 50 this is what I\"\"love about Bioderma they have awesome\"\"SPF 50 these are both photo derm\"\"obviously but one is a R and one is\"\"laser\"\"they're both creams and they're both\"\"very high protection and they both have\"\"high UVA ratings and all the stuff but\"\"one of them is tinted the AR is tinted\"\"so this one is tinted tinted dude these\"\"are both like a pretty light cream\"\"texture they're not heavy at all AR is\"\"tinted which I really really like it\"\"doesn't have a white task on your skin\"\"when you apply it because it's tinted\"\"but it's not like tinted as in its gonna\"\"cover all the imperfections maybe it\"\"does so just very very subtly enough for\"\"those really subtle no makeup days I\"\"think it's awesome you can still wear\"\"makeup on top if you want but I just\"\"like it on its own and it's been my\"\"go-to I tested this out thoroughly I'm\"\"almost done with in my first ever bottle\"\"of this very close to empty what I don't\"\"like about this product is that it only\"\"comes in 30 milliliters like it's not\"\"enough for what it is because I applying\"\"my sunscreen generously like I go a bit\"\"on with this particular sunscreen you\"\"can't be too generous because you can\"\"experience some filling\"\"when you use too much of this so you\"\"just use the amount that you need to get\"\"even coverage to protect your whole face\"\"but still this is like one of my\"\"ultimate favorite products probably ever\"\"because SPF 50 high UVA rating and also\"\"a very very good texture and it's tinted\"\"like what else does a girl need this is\"\"my go-to summer\"\"product it has been to be fair my\"\"polished tres sunscreen that is tinted\"\"but SPF 30 is coming soon I have not\"\"fully tried like an entire bottle yet\"\"I'm only trying to sample there's very\"\"good feedback on this particular\"\"something that I'm talking about though\"\"I would love to kind of compare the two\"\"but this price point is better than the\"\"Paula's Choice and the SPF once again is\"\"higher so even if the polished choice\"\"might be more cosmetically elegant\"\"whatever this one is still better bang\"\"for the buck SPF 50 SPF 50 in the summer\"\"you know yeah I really love this product\"\"but I've got the on tinted version\"\"before I got the tinted version because\"\"I didn't see the tinted version and so I\"\"have both but I prefer the tinted one\"\"even though they're both fantastic\"\"products it's just you know the tinted\"\"one you know it's just it's tinted so\"\"there's no white cast on your skin I'm\"\"not saying that they all have serious\"\"white casts but again I'm a pale person\"\"so that's something that you might want\"\"to consider like if you have darker skin\"\"they also this is the tent net you had\"\"the natural color but they have a golden\"\"color that's even darker than this one\"\"so I would consider going for the darker\"\"color so that you don't have to deal\"\"with the white cast that some sometimes\"\"sunscreens have the back white cast kind\"\"of means that the sunscreen has some\"\"good protection in there that's you know\"\"doing something protecting me I don't\"\"hate the white cast in sunscreens I\"\"always can you know even it out with\"\"some powder on top my mineral powder is\"\"plus about SPF 20 in it you can read\"\"about it on my blog or I'll provide a\"\"link below it's very important that you\"\"wear sunscreen and throughout the day if\"\"you need to reapply your sunscreen I'm\"\"gonna do a shout out for the spray\"\"sunscreen from the Hydra bio range it's\"\"not in the photo derm range but it's\"\"really really good plus the Hydra by a\"\"perfect ur SPF 30 is also an amazing\"\"everyday product for you know spring and\"\"winter like when you're not really out\"\"or like you're not leaving the house\"\"this is the product I like to wear SPF\"\"30 minimum even when I don't leave the\"\"house that's how legit I am too legit to\"\"quit and I like to carry this one around\"\"with me in my bag so that I can reapply\"\"throughout the day like on my body\"\"specifically I really like this and what\"\"I recommend you do with in terms of\"\"makeup like if you're wearing makeup\"\"throughout the day I know you don't want\"\"to glob on more sunscreen right that's\"\"just gonna ruin your makeup and might\"\"feel gross and sticky and ridiculous so\"\"you can either do a fine mist of this\"\"but I prefer to just dust my face very\"\"generously with a powder that has SPF 20\"\"minimum in it and broad-spectrum UVA\"\"protection because mineral powders often\"\"come with zinc oxide titanium dioxide\"\"which is mineral sunscreen protection\"\"and it's really really good so you can\"\"just be very generous with the powder\"\"throughout the day that has sun\"\"protection in it so that you are\"\"reapplying so that you're continuing to\"\"be protected from the uva and UVB rays\"\"you don't want to eat your skin that's\"\"going to equal terrible skin i hope you\"\"really enjoyed this sunscreen video my\"\"dream come true a video about just\"\"sunscreen but i try and wear if you need\"\"help choosing the right sunscreen for\"\"you or if you need help like customizing\"\"your skincare routine because everyone's\"\"skin is different and i understand that\"\"choosing a good product can be super\"\"confusing and super annoying and\"\"frustrating and instead of you know\"\"wasting\"\"money and getting like really frustrated\"\"with the process we just actually work\"\"with me have a routine review service\"\"where I work directly with clients like\"\"literally over Skype we chat we see each\"\"other where I learn everything about\"\"your skin type and curate like a\"\"customized am/pm skin care routine we\"\"talk about makeup everything that you\"\"need to put on your skin and then\"\"there's no guesswork there's no\"\"frustration there's no wasted money\"\"there's no clogged pores which that is\"\"so so you can check that out below i\"\"have a link to my routine review service\"\"and if you like this video give me a\"\"thumbs up let me know if you've tried\"\"any of these products in the comments\"\"below i would love to hear what you\"\"think and i'm also doing like daily\"\"almost instagram live videos where you\"\"can ask me questions live every day I\"\"call my daily powwow so that was a lot\"\"of information you're like my dad links\"\"below this video thank you so much for\"\"watching I will talk to you soon this\"\"was a winner pop the pimple bathtub\"\"hello\"\"welcome back to my channel if you are\"\"here and you are new\"\"your comment as well today we'll be\"\"talking about this bioderma photodam max\"\"spf 50 plus tinted cream\"\"sunscreen and i chose mine in color\"\"golden this\"\"is for sensitive skin and if you want to\"\"see\"\"how this is going to perform please keep\"\"on watching\"\"so as always my morning routine i always\"\"wash my face\"\"so that is what i normally do and you\"\"guys i'm not going to be\"\"going into detail with that i just want\"\"to show you just like\"\"the process before applying this\"\"sunscreen\"\"so that you can see that this is a\"\"genuine review and\"\"we are starting on a clean slate so when\"\"i'm done i just pat my face\"\"and i do not grab my face as i always\"\"say so i just pat my face\"\"dry and then go in with any serums that\"\"i'll be going in with usually my morning\"\"skin care routine you guys is\"\"very very simple so when i'm done doing\"\"that i like to go in with the serums of\"\"the day my morning serums\"\"and just pat it on my face so that i can\"\"go\"\"in with my biodemo of course you guys i\"\"apply\"\"the moisturizer before this then go in\"\"with\"\"this sunscreen so it has been a month\"\"since i've been using this for sunscreen\"\"and i have a lot to say and this retails\"\"for 275. i got it from a discount\"\"and as you guys can see this is how it\"\"looks this is how golden looks like what\"\"kind of golden is the please make it\"\"make sense\"\"how is this golden color maybe you guys\"\"i'm just tripping but anyways that is\"\"how our golden color is looking\"\"i don't know on which skin or maybe in\"\"what skin\"\"i have no idea guys but anyways we're\"\"working with that color\"\"and it's just like a sneak peek just to\"\"show you guys anyways i just wanted to\"\"show you that i'm dressed so\"\"i'm not naked y'all this is how my face\"\"is looking before i apply\"\"the sunscreen now i'm gonna apply this\"\"in three ways because i actually like\"\"tried to work around the sunscreen\"\"because already we can tell that\"\"this is not gonna be matching my skin at\"\"all so this is the normal way in which i\"\"would apply my normal sunscreen that\"\"doesn't\"\"have any tint to it just to say guys\"\"this is a chemical sunscreen so\"\"it is not a mineral sunscreen sometimes\"\"i would expect mineral sunscreens to\"\"give us\"\"white colors but anyways we're still in\"\"um i don't know campaign to actually\"\"bag companies to give us products that\"\"are gonna match our skin\"\"i don't know at all if it's in it's just\"\"difficult to make something that is\"\"going to match\"\"our skin colors or just this chemical\"\"filters\"\"j they're just white or we can't have\"\"any filters that are going to match our\"\"face\"\"i don't know you guys but anyways i work\"\"that sunscreen into my skin and yeah it\"\"is cool right anyways\"\"let's blend it um golden color into your\"\"skin baby your skin is golden your skin\"\"is\"\"gold so you need to match your skin so\"\"anyways i waited for 15 minutes because\"\"usually with my sunscreen\"\"i'd like to apply 15 minutes before if\"\"i'm not late you guys because sometimes\"\"i tend to bleed but anyways\"\"this is how we're looking on the sun wow\"\"y'all this\"\"is beautiful isn't it\"\"so this is the second take so i figured\"\"that that won't work so let me try to\"\"apply this\"\"on my palm rub it on my palm and apply\"\"on my skin and see how this is going to\"\"work and as you guys can see i'm just\"\"using the same amount that\"\"i normally use on my sunscreen that\"\"doesn't give me any white cast and you\"\"guys i\"\"am not slapping myself way too hard i am\"\"just trying to make sure that it is in\"\"my skin like it's it's\"\"it's just like penetrating into my skin\"\"one thing i'll say you guys this product\"\"doesn't go\"\"it doesn't penetrate my skin real quick\"\"and yeah if you've got sensitive skin\"\"this will make you rub your skin because\"\"you need to work it in as you guys can\"\"see it it honestly looks a little bit\"\"better\"\"when i use that method of putting in i\"\"then waited again for 15 minutes to see\"\"if it will absorb to my skin\"\"and i tried you guys it's not the best\"\"but it did try so\"\"when you put it in you rub it on your\"\"palm and try to work it in it is a\"\"little bit\"\"better you do see a little bit of that\"\"white cast but you just need to put a\"\"little bit of work\"\"i hate putting a lot of work more\"\"especially in the morning we are late we\"\"are busy okay\"\"so i washed my face applied the\"\"moisturizer and\"\"the trick yeah this is the trick you\"\"need to apply your moisturizer\"\"and then real quick go in with that\"\"bioderma sunscreen\"\"and rub it on your palm and you are\"\"going to work in layers if you work in\"\"layers\"\"you are not going to go wrong now the\"\"problem is you are going to rub your\"\"skin way more and it is not good for\"\"those who have sensitive skin\"\"i feel like it would work very well if\"\"you've got them like fair\"\"very fair skin because this will just\"\"blend into your skin but you've got some\"\"melanin if you're rich in melanin i\"\"don't know you just need to\"\"like make it work okay like you have to\"\"work it in less as i'm doing here so i\"\"work in layers and you know apply\"\"another layer and\"\"wait apply another layer and wait and\"\"this was actually going in smoothly so\"\"it doesn't work well when you apply a\"\"lot at the same time\"\"so you just need to make sure you\"\"prepare yourself\"\"early before you actually go out because\"\"you're gonna need a lot of\"\"layers and patting in and if your skin\"\"becomes\"\"too sensitive through rubbing then it's\"\"a problem now i'm gonna give it to this\"\"sunscreen\"\"um it doesn't bend or stink it doesn't\"\"even break me out at\"\"all and it just it feels good on skin\"\"it does give a little bit of\"\"moisturizing effect and again if you've\"\"got oily skin it tends to be oilier\"\"um greasy sort of during the day so i\"\"feel like it is also friendly for those\"\"who have got\"\"dry skin um i know if\"\"you have like oily skin and sometimes\"\"you need\"\"like products that are not going to be\"\"you know super oily so yeah take that\"\"so these are the pros it's moisturizing\"\"it doesn't give me any breakout\"\"now um the cons you guys white casts\"\"it doesn't really go in smoothly it just\"\"takes time to absorb\"\"[Music]\"\"one thing that i'll also say you guys is\"\"that this sunscreen doesn't really work\"\"well\"\"with other serums so you need to just\"\"check\"\"which serums your morning serums this\"\"will\"\"not roll more especially when you are\"\"using the first and second method\"\"it is going to roll so i find it work a\"\"little bit better with\"\"the moisturizer now that is it you guys\"\"from me the golden lady and thank you so\"\"much you guys for watching please don't\"\"forget subscribe to like and comment\"\"and i'll see you guys on the next one\"\"bye\"\"my name is ramone cosmetic formulator\"\"aesthetician uk resident and along

tuned hit the\"\"subscribe button notification bell i\"\"have an entire bag full of european\"\"sunscreens i have yet to review i bought\"\"pretty much the entire lineup of user\"\"and sunscreens i also have a video\"\"coming up soon featuring easton freezie\"\"derm and heliocare so hit the\"\"notification bell to know when those\"\"videos go live as well so let's get into\"\"the sunscreens i'll put a card up here\"\"about some other videos where i feature\"\"some other european sunscreens but i am\"\"no stranger to these i've been using\"\"these now for well over six months for\"\"all let me see i use my handy little\"\"quarter teaspoon to measure out the\"\"quantity i do a full quarter teaspoon\"\"generally for face ears and neck but for\"\"the video since this is face application\"\"i do half of this which is an eighth\"\"teaspoon i'll work that in let it sit\"\"for a few minutes so you can see the\"\"final finish and the look of it on the\"\"skin as well as if there's any white\"\"cast so getting started first one we\"\"have is from nivea this is their nivea\"\"sun eevee face shine control this i\"\"bought a long time ago and actually got\"\"confused because i ended up buying two\"\"of these because one of them on the box\"\"just said shine control and the other on\"\"the box said mattifying effect and i\"\"thought they were separate things\"\"they're not same thing this is from\"\"nivea these cost six pounds they cost\"\"costed they cost six pounds when i first\"\"bought them although now they are eight\"\"pound up boots but the magic of boots is\"\"a lot of times they have sales this is\"\"an spf 50 and it does have the uva\"\"circled on it they do designate this as\"\"high uva uvb protection on the back of\"\"this it does have four star uva\"\"protection in the bootstar system some\"\"marketing details nivea sun uv face\"\"shine control offers sun protection\"\"specifically designed for facial needs\"\"light formula offers long lasting and\"\"instant mattifying effects you will note\"\"that the cream absorbs excess oils from\"\"your skin's surface and you'll be\"\"protected from uv and high energy\"\"visible lights which can cause premature\"\"aging your skin will feel light\"\"non-greasy non-sticky it is eye friendly\"\"and ophthalmologically proven as well\"\"worth noting compared to the other ones\"\"in the video this one is not water\"\"resistant formula details uv filter wise\"\"stable benzone for uva octa satellite\"\"for uvb tenosurp s broad spectrum\"\"insulazole for more uvb and then even\"\"lt150 for qb as well this does have\"\"alcohol fragrance and essential oils in\"\"there and so it's really interesting\"\"when they're like oh it's sensitive skin\"\"friendly but it does have those\"\"components and also the eye irritancy\"\"one is interesting as well because i\"\"mean like how do you test that i know\"\"how it's tested but realistically how\"\"that's a very general statement to make\"\"considering how subjective skin feel and\"\"overall experience can be with something\"\"like this does have a couple things like\"\"tapioca starch and silica which aid in\"\"some of the mattifying oil absorbing\"\"benefits to it but then it also has this\"\"specific licorice based extract and in\"\"the marketing for it does say that this\"\"does offer high energy visible light\"\"protection this specific licorice\"\"extract in this is the same exact one in\"\"my holy grail eucerin sunscreen but\"\"aside from that tocopherol acetate for\"\"vitamin e antioxidant benefits and\"\"that's kind of the extent of formulation\"\"stand out my experience with this you\"\"can see with the application the texture\"\"for this is like a little bit creamy\"\"it's got a little bit more body it's not\"\"a true gel which i mean for the sake of\"\"comparison the used saran that i talked\"\"about that is one of my favorites very\"\"gel texture this gel creams a little bit\"\"more body to it and i just mentioned\"\"there's a little bit more of an\"\"emollient component to the formulation\"\"of this it leaves a semi-radiant finish\"\"and it looks like it's going on like a\"\"moisturizer this is one of those\"\"products that i use straight after\"\"rinsing as a one and done product this\"\"is my moisturizer my sunscreen has a\"\"little bit something extra in there as\"\"well but i don't put much underneath\"\"this because the texture of this is a\"\"little bit more moisturizing you can see\"\"as it sets down to me it just leaves a\"\"natural glow to the skin i don't think\"\"it's it's not very greasy it's not very\"\"heavy but it is a moisturizing finish\"\"what's interesting is the mattifying the\"\"shine control that to me is a bit of a\"\"stretch this to me is not modifying in\"\"the slightest but it is very oily skin\"\"compatible the way i see it is it kind\"\"of leaves a natural glow on your face\"\"and basically controls your oils from\"\"making you look any more shiny but you\"\"do have a natural like radiance to you\"\"that gives your skin some life you're\"\"not flat matte dead but this is arguably\"\"i think my favorite in this entire video\"\"and i do use this very regularly because\"\"it's very convenient for me especially\"\"on days when i need a little bit more\"\"moisturization next up on the list this\"\"is one i think i had a lot of comments\"\"when i went to the first european\"\"sunscreen video being like try bioderma\"\"try bioderma so i got a couple from them\"\"this is the bioderma photoderm max spf\"\"50 plus aqua fluid no this is the yellow\"\"tube this is spf 50 plus and this one\"\"has no tint apparently they offer a\"\"light tint and then a gold tint for this\"\"one i don't know what that gold means i\"\"don't know if it means that it's like my\"\"complexion or darker but this does also\"\"come in tinted versions i just have the\"\"regular non-tinted one this was 15 pound\"\"this offers high eva evb and t shine\"\"protection i found on a separate\"\"retailer site because this is no longer\"\"on boots website don't know why this had\"\"a uva pf specifically of 24 and i'm only\"\"noting that because uva\"\"circled anywhere on this i don't believe\"\"and also it doesn't give me a boot star\"\"rating either marketing points pleasant\"\"and easy application thanks to a fluid\"\"texture as light as water dry touch\"\"finish ideal for all skin types even\"\"combination to oily sensitive skin or\"\"intolerant to all types of sunlight very\"\"fair skin with freckles and exposed skin\"\"to maximum sunlight those are all the\"\"skin types and conditions that this is\"\"acceptable for oil-free formula\"\"non-greasy texture good skin tolerance\"\"non-comedogenic unfragranced water\"\"resistant and then main marketing points\"\"behind bowdermist sunscreens is they\"\"have a cellular bioprotection trademark\"\"patent and that is essentially some sort\"\"of like antioxidant situation that they\"\"say boost the overall sun efficacy and\"\"that is some sort of like bioderma\"\"proprietary patent on a specific\"\"formulation component that boosts sun\"\"protection factor of your skin and\"\"aiding with the sunscreen it's the\"\"marketing for it was really weird but on\"\"top of that this also has a synergistic\"\"combination of three powders that give a\"\"mattifying dry touch finish filters in\"\"this this features octokrylan which is\"\"dvb into some of the longer wavelength\"\"uva tinasorb m which is a hybrid filter\"\"it is a chemical filter by composition\"\"but it's an insoluble particle so it's a\"\"solid particle that's suspended in the\"\"formulation so it acts a little bit more\"\"like a mineral filter you have able\"\"benzone which is uva 1 and uva 2 and\"\"then latinos or m i believe is broad\"\"spectrum and then tinos orb s which is\"\"broad spectrum as well so really good\"\"broad spectrum protection and then bumps\"\"up on either end as well this is alcohol\"\"fragrance and essential oil free which\"\"is worth noting because they do make\"\"cleanse this is like great for sensitive\"\"skin or very compromised skin and then\"\"you have the things that help with water\"\"resistance the mattifiers this does have\"\"more emollience in the formulation i\"\"think experience for this you can see as\"\"i'm depositing it into the teaspoon this\"\"is liquidy and if i could just boil this\"\"down to one statement this is like the\"\"sister the wannabe sister of the la\"\"roche posay and thalios choco fluid\"\"sunscreen very similar texture and it\"\"feels like it wants to be the same\"\"product there's a lot of things that\"\"they're not the same first and foremost\"\"talking about the uv protection minds\"\"you spf 50 plus no uva circled on this\"\"that i could find i also did throw away\"\"the box though so if you got the box and\"\"it circled on there comment that down\"\"below but there's also no boot star\"\"rating on this either and i did find a\"\"uva pf rating of 24 which if you're\"\"using like the ppd system like the pa\"\"pluses that you see on korean sunscreens\"\"this would be a pa 4 plus technically\"\"and regardless that is a great daily\"\"sunscreen situation the other part of\"\"this is the fact that it says it's\"\"supposed to be matte with powder dry\"\"touch finish if you look on the screen i\"\"feel like i look i have a gloss to me\"\"it's not greasy but it's like i look\"\"shiny and i don't understand that and i\"\"don't like the way this looks on my skin\"\"if i'm going to be honest part of that\"\"reason is because after a little bit i\"\"feel like my skin looks dry but oily if\"\"that makes any sense but also this has\"\"that tenosurp m component and i\"\"mentioned it basically functions like a\"\"mineral sunscreen it makes this cling to\"\"my facial hair so it looks like i\"\"essentially have a dusting of like white\"\"setting powder all over my mustache my\"\"eyebrows my hairline and my beard so\"\"this is one thing i like to wear under\"\"makeup because i think it does prep the\"\"skin nicely for makeup i just don't like\"\"it by itself and also the other part of\"\"it is it does this thing on like my\"\"under eyes where it gives them like a\"\"great cast next up though from bioderma\"\"again this is their photoderm akn mats\"\"notice this is a white bottle and this\"\"is spf 30. for this one uva is circled\"\"but again no designation on bootstars\"\"for this marketing for this a bioderma\"\"innovation the exclusive fluid active\"\"trademark patent in photoderm akn matte\"\"biologically regulates sebum quality to\"\"keep pores from becoming clogged and\"\"prevent the appearance of blemishes\"\"which is often exacerbated after periods\"\"of sun exposure photogram akn matte\"\"offers real internal biological\"\"protection again that cellular\"\"bioprotection pen and then it also says\"\"this exclusive patent preserves and\"\"stimulates the skin's defenses during\"\"sun exposure so basically long lasting\"\"matte claims non-greasy finish no white\"\"cast they want to emphasize this one\"\"does have a sense to it and it's also\"\"waterproof so talking about some of the\"\"claims that fluid active was interesting\"\"because this one is matte i mean it's in\"\"the name matte this one specifically\"\"talks about a patent to regulate sebum\"\"and keep the skin matte that the other\"\"photoderm didn't have the patented\"\"complex fights against sebum thickening\"\"in order to keep portion becoming\"\"clogged and to minimize the risk of\"\"blemishes appearing which is interesting\"\"so this features salicylic and glycolic\"\"acid i don't think i've ever seen\"\"glycolic acid in the sunscreen period\"\"and i don't think i've ever seen\"\"salicylic acid any sunscreen either\"\"those are exfoliants which is fun i like\"\"that again one and done products who\"\"just love that get your exfoliation and\"\"your sun protection all in one go but i\"\"think those are partly responsible for\"\"that seven regulating benefit salicylic\"\"acid as well as the component of\"\"preventing the pores from becoming\"\"clogged then you also have tocopherol\"\"and tocopheroacetate so both forms of\"\"vitamin e then you have ectoin and\"\"propyl gallate which are antioxidants\"\"you also have ginkgo biloba extract\"\"which always reminds me of fenty skin\"\"love her and then golden kelp which is a\"\"kelp extract and kind of aids in water\"\"binding so it's like humectant benefits\"\"but can also potentially have some skin\"\"soothing benefits or antioxidant\"\"benefits as well filters this has\"\"octopriline so uvb uva2 tinosorb m once\"\"again so that's that broad spectrum\"\"hybrid filter and then evobenzone for\"\"uva protection less filters but\"\"interesting assortment again this is\"\"only spf 30 which is perfectly adequate\"\"great daily protection or if you don't\"\"necessarily need the high high high\"\"factor because again this is water\"\"resistant so it's great for daily on the\"\"go or just like minimal sun exposure\"\"where for example you might sweat a lot\"\"but again it's interesting again i point\"\"out this is spf 30 does have that uva\"\"circle could not find a uva pf rating\"\"for this but the other bio dimmer\"\"doesn't have that why is that but as you\"\"see with the application similar body\"\"similar texture it's very watery\"\"lightweight it is giving that la roche\"\"posay and thalios fluid this goes on\"\"nicely though i think i have a\"\"preference for this specific one over\"\"the other bioderma what i will say is\"\"that i also definitely like to\"\"moisturize well underneath this this in\"\"itself does have some emollients and\"\"body to it but the mattifying effect of\"\"this on non-moisturized skin can get\"\"very unpleasant very quick so it'll be\"\"moisturized very well i think this is\"\"beautiful for oily skin i wouldn't\"\"recommend these for dry skin i'm gonna\"\"be honest just for that finish and\"\"texture issue and for either of these if\"\"you have deep skin i would not count on\"\"these just because of the teenage sort\"\"of m elements and then last sunscreen\"\"this is the vichy ideal soleil\"\"mattifying face dry touch sun cream so i\"\"was very excited to try some vichy\"\"options vichy to me it's like a very\"\"french pharmacy and i don't know why\"\"because i think technically bioderma is\"\"too but vichy's like the pinnacle of\"\"like french pharmacy to me so i was very\"\"excited to try this out this is 16 pound\"\"50 for 50ml the marketing behind this is\"\"idiosola modifying face dry touch spf 50\"\"helps protect the skin against the\"\"harmful effects of sun into uv has soft\"\"dry touch zero shine water resistant\"\"finish they do say suitable for\"\"combination and sensitive skin and then\"\"it's enriched with vichy mineralizing\"\"thermal water again this is spf 50 this\"\"does have a uva plus circled there is no\"\"uva pf indicated on this either but i do\"\"trust that this has good protection this\"\"formula includes a white spectrum filter\"\"system and photostable uva ebv based\"\"mixorals mixorals are l'oreal patented\"\"filters vichy is a l'oreal sub brand and\"\"then that vichy mineral water so a lot\"\"of brands like lourish jose vichy really\"\"center around this thermal water\"\"situation and we should explain it like\"\"this vichy mineral water strengthens the\"\"natural defenses of the skin the\"\"volcanic water of vichy was born from\"\"the volcanoes of ovarn rich in 15\"\"essential minerals so essentially it's\"\"like water that's volcanic water\"\"enriched with minerals that can really\"\"aid in the skin barrier function and\"\"moisturization and blah blah blah so\"\"filter wise you have homosalates\"\"octosale evinol t150 tinosorp s mixoral\"\"xl avobenzone octocrylene mixoryl sx and\"\"nanotitanium dioxide so you got a whole\"\"salad up in there of uv filters\"\"primarily these are all chemical filters\"\"we do see that nano titanium dioxide\"\"always a concern anytime you see a\"\"mineral or mineral adjacent filter but\"\"it's nano so that hopefully will aid in\"\"a little bit more elegance per se but\"\"aside from that this is alcohol free but\"\"this is fragrance and this is fragranced\"\"underlying exclamation points this is\"\"perfumey it's giving macy's fragrance\"\"counter the fragrance on this one is\"\"strong and if you have compromised skin\"\"i'm gonna be honest my eye areas right\"\"now very compromised they were on fire\"\"when i put this on so i don't know why\"\"this is compatible with sensitive skin\"\"because i disagree that's just me and\"\"then there's a couple botanical based\"\"extracts for example there's a cinnamon\"\"botanical extract in this which i looked\"\"into what it could potentially do skin\"\"wise and it has potentially a steady\"\"sauce some potential and anti-terrorism\"\"and antioxidant benefits which basically\"\"means it can kind of help with pigment\"\"fading benefits and also some\"\"antioxidant protection the big one for\"\"this one though is that it's mattifying\"\"it's mattifying dry touch i agree with\"\"those claims but i didn't find it was a\"\"very elegant experience you can see i\"\"put it on this is more of a gel\"\"situation so it's very reminiscent of\"\"the eucerin it's not as moisturizing\"\"though it doesn't have that annoyance\"\"that the nivea one kind of does this one\"\"definitely does have this dry down like\"\"dry touch effect that fragrance is so\"\"strong it does linger for like at least\"\"half an hour afterwards maybe a little\"\"bit more and that's definitely just the\"\"biggest thing this does have that\"\"fragrance to it texture wise this does\"\"wear really nice under makeup i find it\"\"does prep the skin well i'm wearing it\"\"under my face right now if you\"\"moisturize well underneath this you\"\"don't have any issues with it cleaning\"\"to texture or any dry patches on the\"\"skin but you do have to moisturize even\"\"having oily skin use a gel moisturizer\"\"but you will have to pipe your skin\"\"adequately for this and you can't see it\"\"right now but when i look in the mirror\"\"i see it i just have like a coating a\"\"dusting of whites on my facial hair my\"\"mustache and everything in my eyebrows\"\"because of this and i'm going to\"\"attribute that more to the titanium\"\"dioxide in this so it's not really\"\"elegant in dark hair dark facial hair or\"\"whatnot so that's another big con if you\"\"apply this in the right way this is very\"\"nice it's very workable but you will\"\"have to tolerate that fragrance so with\"\"that that is round two of european\"\"chemist pharmacy sunscreens this was a\"\"toss up really some of these are not\"\"that great or they're like a very\"\"mid-tier there's like things i could do\"\"to like bump them up but they're just\"\"they're not great the nevaeh one i think\"\"is my favorite out of all these and i do\"\"reach for it pretty substantially let me\"\"know down below in the comments section\"\"what other boots related or european\"\"chemist sunscreens do you want to see me\"\"review on the channel don't forget to\"\"hit the subscribe button notification\"\"bell so that you know when i post more\"\"skincare sunscreen and fancy rated\"\"content on my channel give it a thumbs\"\"up and thanks for watching guys bye\"\"[Music]\"\"you\"\"hi today I'm reviewing the Bioderma\"\"photo durm aqua fluid SPF and really\"\"quick I just want to say purchase eye\"\"products with my own money\"\"I'll never waste your time with\"\"sponsored ads or videos so if you want\"\"to help support the channel check out no\"\"BS beauty comm check out my patreon\"\"community or click on the Amazon link\"\"below okay so these were this is another\"\"sunscreen I picked up at look\"\"fantasticks UK page they should be\"\"paying me like a referral fee because\"\"I'm advertising for them a lot anyway\"\"that's where I picked up most of the\"\"European type sunscreens where is in the\"\"US it's difficult to get them because\"\"the FDA is about 50 years behind on\"\"sunscreen approvals literally I think\"\"it's like been since 1970 since they\"\"approved any new filters something like\"\"that something crazy so anyway there's\"\"some ways around it I like to find the\"\"way around it because you know if you\"\"live in the US and you're using a\"\"typical chemical sunscreen you're not\"\"really getting great UVA coverage and\"\"UVA rays are once that cause wrinkles\"\"and fine lines and skin damage so keep\"\"that in mind most Americans probably\"\"would age so much better if they had\"\"access to European sunscreens but most\"\"I'm probably a lot of them probably\"\"don't even know what they're missing\"\"until you've tried them and not at least\"\"I didn't so anyway Bioderma calls this a\"\"very high sun protection with a fluid\"\"texture as light as water with a dry\"\"touch finish suitable for all skin types\"\"even combination to oily skin skin that\"\"is sensitive to are intolerant to all\"\"types of sunlight very fair-skinned with\"\"freckles and skin that as a pole exposed\"\"to maximum sunlight or anybody that\"\"really just wants to prevent aging okay\"\"so let me get to my first criteria which\"\"is packaging and I like the packaging\"\"nice squeeze to bottle although it does\"\"have a tendency to be very goopy when\"\"you open it up and it's got kind of a\"\"needle nose tip on it so just keep that\"\"in mind once you start once you dump it\"\"over it'll start leaking out and I'll\"\"apply it in a second so okay no issues\"\"with that\"\"in terms of denatured or drying types of\"\"alcohol this does not have any of those\"\"so that's always a good thing even\"\"though it's got a nice liquid texture no\"\"drain alcohols does contain some fatty\"\"alcohols such as sea 20-22 which are a\"\"good type of alcohol a few of you\"\"mention the crave beauty beat the beat\"\"the sunscreen beat the Sun sunscreen\"\"which I reviewed a few days ago and\"\"really liked a lot of the\"\"characteristics of it but we're not so\"\"excited that alcohol is higher up on the\"\"ingredient list in my opinion this is a\"\"good alternative to that it's got all of\"\"the good characteristics of it without\"\"the alcohol so I mentioned that as\"\"something worth checking out if you were\"\"a very sensitive skin or a bit nervous\"\"about that\"\"so something worth considering terms of\"\"fragrance this does not have any\"\"fragrance in it which is great and no\"\"scent at all it doesn't even have the\"\"chemical sunscreen smell which most or a\"\"lot of chemical sunscreens have so this\"\"one's awesome because there's literally\"\"no scent to it so very great for\"\"sensitive skin in terms of the\"\"manufacturing location this one is made\"\"in France so no issues at all with that\"\"SPF coverage which is UVB coverage is\"\"50-plus so that means it's great I\"\"recommend at least 30 everyday and 50 is\"\"great especially if you wear a\"\"foundation over your sunscreen the more\"\"layers you apply over sunscreen the more\"\"diluted the coverage potentially can be\"\"I saw on a chart the other day it was a\"\"sunscreen product the chart had the list\"\"of order of ingredients or what you use\"\"so you cleanse you tone serum sunscreen\"\"primer then foundation and I thought you\"\"know what I always apply my primer\"\"before the sunscreen just because any\"\"layer you put over it has a potential to\"\"kind of decrease the amount of\"\"protection you're getting so something\"\"worth considering I always play my\"\"primer before hand although it kind of\"\"sometimes defeats a bit of the point of\"\"primer so even just foundation could\"\"kind of dilute it a little bit so I\"\"that's why I think in my opinion thirty\"\"is the least but fifty is good\"\"especially if you're gonna play\"\"foundation or makeup over it it's just\"\"you're getting much better protection\"\"although one thing to keep in mind the\"\"amok you go over thirty you're not\"\"getting you're not getting twenty more\"\"than third it kind of decreases a little\"\"bit the higher up you go but it's still\"\"stronger and better so okay terms of the\"\"UVA protection factor this one has a PPD\"\"of twenty four which is something I\"\"would wanted to remember to mention it\"\"more often which is persistent pigment\"\"darkening so sixteen and up on that\"\"scale qualifies as adequate protection\"\"the higher up the number the better some\"\"sunscreens have demonstrated a PPD of 65\"\"or higher so that's very good coverage\"\"so this one's twenty four so that's\"\"pretty good up there pretty good up\"\"there pretty good pretty high up there\"\"so I have no issues with that it's\"\"probably much better than the average US\"\"sunscreen okay then in terms of the\"\"filters used in this we've got Evo Ben\"\"zone which is a UV Avery absorber which\"\"is typically unstable but it can be\"\"helped with the use of other filters in\"\"it which can help it be a bit more\"\"stable although AVO Ben zone on its own\"\"for just UVA rays is probably what most\"\"US sunscreens have and it's not not good\"\"enough in my opinion so then we've got\"\"octo cry lean which is a UVB absorber\"\"and it also has the ability to absorb\"\"some short UVA rays I'm sorry if you can\"\"hear my dogs barking I know someone must\"\"be walking up and down the street or\"\"there's a squirrel in the yard so I'm\"\"sure you can hear it I'm sorry okay\"\"then we've got methylene\"\"you know there must be like a turkey in\"\"the yard or something\"\"okay then I've got methylene biz Benza\"\"Trion tetramethyl beautiful which is\"\"also known as vis acht result which is a\"\"broad-spectrum UVA and UVB ray absorber\"\"it also has some ability to reflect and\"\"scatter UV light so it's a great filter\"\"then we've got tin syrup s which is a\"\"UVA and UVB ray absorber also very photo\"\"stable so we've got a good variety of\"\"filters for both UVA and UVB rays so I\"\"have no issues with that then we get\"\"into the white cast and I will apply it\"\"and this one really doesn't have a white\"\"cast see how liquidy it comes out man\"\"the dogs are just going crazy okay so\"\"after you apply it it does take a minute\"\"to really soak it in but for the most\"\"part there's not much of a white cast\"\"initially it looks like you're gonna\"\"have a white cast and maybe it has a\"\"very mild white cast but for the most\"\"part in my opinion this is one of the\"\"better sunscreens in terms of white\"\"casts because there isn't much once it\"\"absorbs really sets to a nice matte\"\"finish with not much minimal white cast\"\"if anything and there you go so I in my\"\"opinion you can't really see a white\"\"cast so and after it's so give after you\"\"give it a couple minutes to soak in it\"\"really has no light cast Lincoln honey\"\"what trouble are you causing those tails\"\"are just out of control\"\"Notty okay so I'll do a pH test just for\"\"you guys and gals I love the pH so\"\"I would say it's a pH of about five ish\"\"maybe five and a half maybe so no issues\"\"with that one okay in terms of texture\"\"obviously it's a very goopy liquidy\"\"texture which isn't always the easiest\"\"to work with because it is so liquidy\"\"although I guess in the title aqua fluid\"\"I guess you get that although what I\"\"like about it is after it's soaked in\"\"after you've given a few minutes to soak\"\"in it really scents to a nice matte non\"\"sticky finish which is a big deal for a\"\"lot of people so after you give it a\"\"minute or two to soak in it's really not\"\"sticking doesn't transfer a ton so\"\"that's always a nice factor as well so\"\"no issues with the texture although I\"\"guess it says it's fluid ease of use so\"\"smooths over skin very easily slightly\"\"hydrating works well over most\"\"moisturizers and primers I could give a\"\"minute to absorb sets to a nice\"\"invisible finish a great option for\"\"those that don't wear foundation or even\"\"if you do our foundation good option for\"\"that too but I know a lot of people that\"\"don't wear foundation really like\"\"something that sets to a nice matte\"\"finish with no noticeable white cast so\"\"there we go\"\"and now that it's absorbed it's not\"\"sticky at all so very nice okay then in\"\"terms of antioxidants and beneficial\"\"ingredients this one contains a lot of\"\"slip and basic hydrating ingredients not\"\"a ton of real beneficial ingredients or\"\"antioxidants which is kind of in my\"\"opinion the major downside with this one\"\"is there's really not a ton of great\"\"stuff it's got vitamin E which is great\"\"xylitol and mannitol which are both\"\"humectants and that's about it for\"\"really exciting beneficial ingredients\"\"so if you're gonna use this one I really\"\"recommend applying over a really good\"\"vitamin C serum or another great\"\"hydrating serum or moisturizer so\"\"that's got some good things for your\"\"skin so your skin isn't just totally\"\"relying on this to do it all because it\"\"really it can it can block the Rays but\"\"it can't help really hydrate skin or\"\"anything else for that matter so keep\"\"that one in mind that in terms of acne\"\"genic ingredients does have a few acne\"\"triggers so we've got glyceryl stearate\"\"citrate which is a fungal acne trigger\"\"and then vitamin E which is can be very\"\"acne genic for some people so that's\"\"about it so pretty friendly for acne\"\"prone skin with the exception of the\"\"vitamin E then we've got animal testing\"\"and unfortunately Bioderma is not\"\"cruelty free which surprised me because\"\"for some reason I guess it's been a\"\"while since I reviewed anything for\"\"Bioderma but they are sold in mainland\"\"China so they're not cruelty free then\"\"in terms of performance I'm really happy\"\"with it lasts nicely on skin without\"\"breaking up foundation or becoming oily\"\"or greasy feeling throughout the day\"\"partially water resistant as well great\"\"for sensitive skin especially with the\"\"fact that has no alcohol and no\"\"fragrance performs above average it\"\"exceeded my expectations in my opinion\"\"so it's quite happy with it it does take\"\"a little bit of finesse to remove at the\"\"end of the day the more water resistant\"\"the sunscreen is the trickier I find\"\"them to be to remove they just require a\"\"bit more effort so if you use this one\"\"might be wise to do a two step cleanse\"\"so oil based cleanser first and then a\"\"soapy cleanser after that just to make\"\"sure you move it all because you\"\"certainly don't want to go to bed with\"\"any traces of sunscreen on your skin\"\"just for so many reasons especially acne\"\"and things like that okay then in terms\"\"of the price so this is the full size\"\"which is 1.33 ounces which is the\"\"equivalent of 40 milliliters and retails\"\"for about 17 dollars wherever your look\"\"so that averages out to about 42 cents\"\"per milliliter which is in the very\"\"affordable ring\"\"it's not the cheapest sunscreen I've\"\"reviewed but it's also not the most\"\"expensive so that's a nice factor so on\"\"the saris car scale with 15 being\"\"perfect this one is guarded 12 so pretty\"\"good couple things I might mess with on\"\"it maybe not but overall it's still\"\"pretty pretty darn good option so anyway\"\"I'm interested in hearing from you guys\"\"if you've had a chance to try this I\"\"think there's another Bioderma product\"\"coming up that I'll be reviewing this\"\"week as well so be sure to stay tuned\"\"for that one so anyway I love hearing\"\"from you guys so leave your comments and\"\"I will see you more tomorrow thank you\"\"so much guys\"\"well hey guys it is Saturday it's the\"\"weekend before a New Year's Eve New\"\"Year's Day so yeah you're watching this\"\"the weekend after more than likely but\"\"this morning I cracked into a new\"\"sunscreen and I finished up the one that\"\"I was using before from Europe and I\"\"cracked into you this morning I cracked\"\"into the via derma photo jar max I think\"\"it's called SPF 50 plus also from Europe\"\"that one of you all sent me I really\"\"like it it's very liquidy so you know\"\"it's it it's fragrance free as as all of\"\"the European sunscreens it's got UVA\"\"filters that are a little bit more photo\"\"stable than those we have here in the US\"\"and I blend it in really nicely to the\"\"skin no white cast moisturizing that\"\"there wasn't like any alcohol leanness\"\"to it\"\"I think oily skin types would like it\"\"yeah but anyways I'm headed over to my\"\"mom's house we're gonna have some lunch\"\"get cracking on our planners it's kind\"\"of a gloomy day and it's been raining so\"\"the allergens are high that it's what\"\"it's going on hope everybody is having a\"\"fantastic new year and sailing right\"\"along as you saw this morning my\"\"Christmas tree is still up all pokey on\"\"getting not Downers then ocupado but\"\"lately a lot of things so that is on my\"\"to-do list for this upcoming week as to\"\"a sadly take down my tree Joe down some\"\"of my deck or on my kitchen counter but\"\"and that's so sad for me because\"\"honestly Christmas is like the only\"\"thing I really get into we dig forward\"\"for and even that's pretty minimal now\"\"it's like anyways I'm here so I'll check\"\"me good well hey guys I just made it to\"\"my mom's house and um looks like she is\"\"picking down a Christmas decor as well\"\"slowly but surely in a piecemeal fashion\"\"that movie\"\"the village is bare my mom has taken the\"\"village down but um I'm just making a\"\"tea for myself here with the Nutcracker\"\"mug before he gets put away and I'm\"\"gonna try this Christmas morning black\"\"and green tea bites - you guys\"\"recommended these teas and this one\"\"looks like a good one so we'll give it a\"\"try here and see how it goes\"\"yeah they were out of the Stello at the\"\"grocery store um last time that I want\"\"to repurchase it and I tried the Jabalia\"\"have you guys ever had Jabalia so it's\"\"pretty good I've been drinking that um\"\"and it's a little milder than the\"\"vostell oo but it's a good one I also\"\"like Lavazza\"\"a lot but for whatever reason Lavazza\"\"sells out really fast and I have a\"\"difficult time sourcing it and you\"\"already had lunch I'm gonna move so I'm\"\"just about to make my own cauliflower\"\"oats um I have a recipe for this close\"\"to down below but I'm gonna use and the\"\"timer's just going off but my mom has um\"\"some frozen rice cauliflower here you\"\"got this at Costco yeah is that what we\"\"had on not Christmas Day it's really\"\"good um\"\"it is the Maas River organic rice\"\"cauliflower and it comes in these little\"\"pouches and I guess you could put this\"\"in the microwave\"\"oh wait for five minutes the first three\"\"minutes then you rub you flip it over\"\"you don't flip it over what you rotate\"\"it yeah yeah I'm doing the microwave\"\"it's easier\"\"well no I'm gonna do it on the stove but\"\"so the Christmas morning black tea I\"\"have to say tastes just like you mean\"\"ordinary black tea I don't really taste\"\"either the green tea component or\"\"anything particularly Christmasy about\"\"it um so if you like black tea you might\"\"like that one but I have to say I have\"\"had this Christmas in Paris this is a\"\"nighttime caffeine free one and this one\"\"is really good it's kind of got a\"\"chocolatey taste to it\"\"subtly so this is probably one of my\"\"favorites that I've had from stash so\"\"far what did you think of Christmas in\"\"Paris did you like it\"\"no the nighttime line yeah so I've just\"\"got my colleague rice cauliflower\"\"cooking up here and I'm going to add a\"\"third of a cup of these are rolled oats\"\"just from Quaker Oatmeal\"\"and I'm gonna let that cook on here and\"\"then I'm gonna add half a serving of the\"\"chocolate organic protein so this is the\"\"candle that I mentioned in my lifestyle\"\"favorites video the Tuscany candle um I\"\"think I called it balsam fir I haven't\"\"tried this one but you guys know I love\"\"the Tuscany candle companies but it's\"\"actually called first snow that my mom\"\"has and she doesn't have it lit\"\"currently five he's got you lit it this\"\"morning yeah that's the wax not going\"\"and you can\"\"smell it's really nice yeah it really\"\"does it smells like like we're Narnia in\"\"here it's a good January fragrance you\"\"find it on sale you should get you know\"\"is that too much you only live one hi\"\"hat my mom was just sharing with me some\"\"bread that she's tried out you might\"\"tell him what it is I got this at Whole\"\"Foods they're calling it cinnamon raisin\"\"bread natural but it's vegan I guess\"\"yeah and gluten free it's got it's made\"\"with garbanzo bean flour and potato\"\"starch oh cool it's not um yeah garbanzo\"\"bean flour rice milk and an egg replacer\"\"so no eggs cool it tastes good I enjoyed\"\"it doesn't taste almond butter and I'm\"\"thinking it would be good I bet it would\"\"yeah whoo I guess an apple butter but\"\"that has so much sugar you can make make\"\"it it's pretty easy to make it like I\"\"thought yeah what's uh what's going on\"\"in your nails here oh look look my mom\"\"got a gel manicure\"\"no these are just a little stick on\"\"there pretty I guess that's something\"\"fun to do where'd you get that I bought\"\"these at Walmart they actually look you\"\"did a good job putting them on there\"\"yeah they're pretty no-brainer yeah\"\"hey you know you they just have a little\"\"thing on the back you peel it off the\"\"sticker come on Wow\"\"yeah yeah that sounds like something I\"\"could handle I wonder how easy they are\"\"to get off though I watched his vlog and\"\"she just hope you know one under here\"\"okay can't be so amazing no that's handy\"\"I don't think they're gonna last very\"\"long well I look you did a good job\"\"putting them on there I thought you got\"\"I thought you got a special manicure and\"\"I thought oh here she's going on the\"\"jail bandwagon whatever you have floss\"\"tubers she gave a really good tutorial\"\"about how about how to use you did a\"\"good job she always has the seasonal\"\"ones yeah\"\"yeah I've seen people talk about that\"\"what is it Jam Jam Rapstar jam Jam\"\"regeneration I showed what it is impress\"\"well they are pretty impressive looking\"\"helpful tips new yeah I'm impressed\"\"wasn't with houses how well they look\"\"yeah it's like you got a manicure they\"\"feel pretty we're awfully pretty sturdy\"\"and cut them down yeah I don't like long\"\"nails yeah we got a pinky one you want\"\"to put it on our path here's the final\"\"product I have my cauliflower oats I\"\"mixed in some blueberries and then I\"\"topped it with some of that Cambria joys\"\"granola and my mom has these little\"\"banana chips that I decorated around and\"\"then I just dusted some cinnamon on top\"\"so that looks delicious I've got one of\"\"my tutti fruity spoons here and a little\"\"orange though that's what I'm having and\"\"then my mom has these strawberry oh\"\"sorry cos I really like these you get\"\"those at Kroger and you're working on\"\"your Scotty so I got you right yeah yeah\"\"and I got my planner here and some\"\"correspondents I need to work on and\"\"look at all of my planner supplies here\"\"in this bag I've got these cute little\"\"panda know cards that I'm one of you all\"\"sweet people sent me so I'm excited to\"\"use those for list making this year and\"\"so yeah doing really well on my blue sky\"\"and all of my pens I really enjoyed\"\"these Stadler pens they last a really\"\"long time do you have a son of the\"\"Statler pens they last a long time and\"\"then update on my gelasa tees these are\"\"pretty awesome I recommend them these\"\"are by BIC I really like the gelasa T\"\"pens they're know that they're to write\"\"with they're similar to the pilot G\"\"tubes they're very similar as far as\"\"their aesthetic and in the type of ink\"\"that flows but I caught him at CVS on\"\"they were on sale and I headed coupons\"\"yeah yeah I saw my apology to color the\"\"colored ones of those that I have I'm\"\"all out of but I have I like to write\"\"with the black ones as well so I've got\"\"some of those but I didn't bring them\"\"with me\"\"I finally filled this out have this\"\"little Mole skiing book here that I keep\"\"addresses in and I just put my p.o box\"\"information on on the front here and it\"\"says as a reward is found sunscreen so\"\"sad I've had this little booklet for\"\"years and I'm finally using it for\"\"something something useful but I just\"\"finished up sending some cute thank-you\"\"cards here\"\"let it snow it's very January theme and\"\"I was able to use here I'll cover my\"\"this person's return address here but I\"\"decorated my um my envelopes with these\"\"cute little snowflake stickers to match\"\"that um I had I was using in my planner\"\"so one thing I'll say about these though\"\"you you got these right and Michael's\"\"snowflake stickers those are from\"\"Oh Hobby Lobby yeah their fYI I mean\"\"they're they're cute but they're not\"\"very good quality for I think they're\"\"called stickability\"\"yeah they're um they're little difficult\"\"to pick pick off of the off of the sheet\"\"if you're into stickers like I am what\"\"are you doing there texting and I just\"\"made myself one of my um my easy breezy\"\"hot chocolates all I do is I nuke some\"\"almond milk in the microwave for about\"\"two minutes and then I mix in a\"\"tablespoon of the Trader Joe's\"\"unsweetened cocoa and - - stevia packets\"\"and some cinnamon and then I add boiling\"\"water to at the top it's quite delicious\"\"so easy and I bet you could also make up\"\"put some not instant coffee in there and\"\"make it like January you got some good\"\"stuff in your sock I sure did I had a\"\"wonderful cause this is one thing that\"\"we got in our stockings this year this\"\"is a sample but the wild foods teas um\"\"this is this is a sample one we got a\"\"biggie pac right yeah have you tried it\"\"yet no I'm just thinking no we\"\"definitely need to do that yeah maybe we\"\"should try it this weekend it is it is\"\"what does this flavor over there comes\"\"with a cute little coloring doodle here\"\"Wow\"\"Wow Very Berry antioxidants wild tea\"\"yeah I'm looking forward to tasting that\"\"because I like the berry teas you like\"\"the traditional teas to the black and\"\"our ochre yeah you really like Earl Grey\"\"[Music]\"\"well hey guys I just got out of the\"\"shower I ended up going to the gym and\"\"getting a good workout in and I just\"\"took a quick shower I think my mom and I\"\"are gonna watch a movie tonight but I'm\"\"doing a sheet mask here kind of what's\"\"going through some of the skincare stuff\"\"that I had from 2017 and this popped up\"\"in my stash this is the let's see yeah I\"\"think the kind folks it may be beauty so\"\"she sent me this yes that is correct\"\"this is the hyaluronic acid mask\"\"concentrated hyaluronic acid moisture\"\"revitalizing firmness it claims by Hera\"\"this is a Korean sheet mask and I am not\"\"entirely sure what the ingredients are\"\"but as with most of the Korean sheet\"\"masks heavy heavy-handed on the\"\"fragrance I can detect that right away\"\"but we shall see how it does I really\"\"like the fit of these that honestly so\"\"that's a plus for but it's it's pretty\"\"heavily fragranced a little eye water\"\"inducing but we'll see how it stacks up\"\"to the cream shop so far those are my\"\"favorite Korean masks but far and away\"\"my favorite sheet masks as I said in my\"\"a skincare favorites of 2017 have to be\"\"those hada labo ones from japan they're\"\"really just just like the hyaluronic\"\"acid some glycerine and no fragrance so\"\"I think they're they're a little better\"\"but anyways masking it right along I'm\"\"gonna just let that incubate on there\"\"for oh no 20 minutes while I chitty-chat\"\"with you guys because bringing it back\"\"to you it really what matters I wanted\"\"to chitchat a little bit about the via\"\"derma photo Duramax SPF 50 plus that I\"\"am so that I am going into January on I\"\"suppose this one of you kind folks sent\"\"me from from\"\"Netherlands am I saying that correct\"\"please comment below I hae\"\"mispronouncing things so I always hear\"\"people saying in other lands but that's\"\"not right I can't be right so I think\"\"it's NIT Orleans right Netherlands\"\"sounds right to me\"\"I should have Google Google guest a\"\"guest that before I got on here but\"\"anyways this is a sunscreen from France\"\"and yeah I did a little research on the\"\"ingredients online so I can be sure give\"\"you some accurate information rather\"\"just saying and it feels great\"\"this contains one one filter that I\"\"wanted to talk about it has a really\"\"long name so I didn't write it down here\"\"hon on a cute little little pineapple\"\"post-it note it's this ethyl axial oxy\"\"phenol methoxy phenol triazine which is\"\"essentially a bit much the motrin demo\"\"trigonal which the trade name see this\"\"is why sometimes having trade names is\"\"helpful because who wants to say all\"\"that but the trade name is tennis orb\"\"and tennis or blocks is a filter that\"\"will effectively cover both UVB and UVA\"\"it is very very very photo stabile and\"\"what I mean by photostable oil is that\"\"when exposed to ultraviolet light from\"\"the Sun it remains stable on the skin it\"\"doesn't degrade and so it maintains its\"\"its UV blocking capacity more so over\"\"what is commonly found in many of our\"\"sunscreens here in the US and buys us\"\"UVA protection which is ava Ben's own\"\"okay and furthermore tennis orb is nice\"\"because it it when it's added to others\"\"other other other filters alike Ava\"\"Ben's own it can further stabilize those\"\"so in the present it makes Ava Ben's own\"\"do a little better ok it's kind of like\"\"sound like a tutor or okay for Ava benzo\"\"and it just it just helps it along so in\"\"short you know the European sunscreens\"\"have this ingredient and similar filters\"\"and other sunscreens that are chemical\"\"you know in Japan\"\"it's been approved in Europe since 2000\"\"okay the u.s. is so slow on this\"\"bandwagon it's painful here in the US\"\"you know we have Mex real and like\"\"unlike some of the LA roche-posay stuff\"\"that you can get over the counter which\"\"you know stabilizes a Levin zone to a\"\"certain degree but it's not as fantastic\"\"as the biskits rise all and demet rise\"\"all ingredients I don't know why they've\"\"taken so long to to get them approved\"\"here and then you add a spot that is\"\"that and another note about this filter\"\"so it's 10 the the trade name is tin\"\"sorb s okay there's also a tennis or\"\"best aqua which I learned about today\"\"tennis or s aqua is basically the tennis\"\"orb in a sort of methyl methacrylate\"\"matrix if you will\"\"dispersion kind of thing which basically\"\"allows it to go into water okay and I'm\"\"not sure Bioderma has utilized that I\"\"didn't look into that but I feel as\"\"though it has and the reason that that's\"\"cool is that it allows it to go into\"\"water so it helps you know that the\"\"filter is can can be dispersed in that\"\"in sort of a liquidy form versus here in\"\"the US you know ayiva been zone is\"\"largely oil soluble so a lot of the\"\"chemical sunscreens people complain or\"\"just to oil and make them shiny make\"\"them greasy okay so you know yes\"\"tennis orb as far as a chemical filter\"\"is a little it's superior to do the ones\"\"we have in the u.s. period you know it's\"\"a little bit more stable and it's the\"\"aesthetics of how it can go on and what\"\"it can can do as far as as the vehicle\"\"make it more desirable to consumers okay\"\"so it has a larger consumer appeal and\"\"that's really important because you know\"\"a big big big problem with sunscreens I\"\"mean you know in general is not so much\"\"you know that the filter degrades or\"\"that you know the you know whatever it's\"\"really failure to use okay so that's why\"\"I always tell you guys you're always\"\"like what's the best sunscreen blah blah\"\"blah and what's the one that you like\"\"and use because you know I can\"\"on and on about the different filters\"\"and that sort of thing but you know if\"\"it leaves a white Sheen on your face\"\"you're not gonna want to wear it you're\"\"not gonna run it want to reapply it's\"\"gonna be difficult if it makes you all a\"\"shiny greasy you're not gonna like that\"\"either okay and you know at the end of\"\"the day it has to be something that you\"\"comfortably can put on and and and use\"\"for yourself I really really wish the US\"\"would get this here you know we could\"\"get this here in the u.s. in Japan and\"\"you know Asia they have them in their\"\"sunscreens and so I'm very grateful to\"\"you for sending it to me another note\"\"about the Bioderma are just these\"\"sunscreens that contain tennis or but\"\"another note about tennis or that I\"\"don't know maybe you all will find\"\"helpful you know I talked about my\"\"sunscreen QA there's all this fear\"\"around cancer promoting effects of some\"\"of the chemical filters you know in the\"\"laboratory studies if you put a bunch of\"\"like some of our chemical filters on\"\"cells and a dish you know you can see up\"\"regulation and certain estrogen and\"\"related genes and that's like very scary\"\"to people in general you know for\"\"potential breast cancer promoting\"\"properties as I said in that video just\"\"objectively speaking all the long-term\"\"data that we have from from human use\"\"does not support any sort of\"\"cancer-causing promoting of the facts\"\"okay\"\"but you know I'm you know I tell you\"\"that that's the objective information\"\"but you know I'm Amanda thetic to to the\"\"concern you know if you if you know you\"\"or anybody you know has ever had a\"\"cancer before I mean nobody really I can\"\"totally relate to you not wanting to\"\"wait on the science to parse things out\"\"you know and just that that that slight\"\"tinge of uncertainty I totally relate to\"\"that I'm so a note about tennis orb you\"\"know is that unlike the other filters in\"\"those laboratory studies did not show\"\"any estrogen kind of regulating effects\"\"or estrogen dependent gene gene kind of\"\"alterations if you all okay so you know\"\"if that's something that you fear\"\"you know objectively speaking hopefully\"\"the information that I give to give you\"\"maybe can help you make an informed\"\"decision but you know I completely\"\"completely understand still not feeling\"\"comfortable putting it on your face and\"\"wanting to avoid some of these chemical\"\"filters here in the US you know if you\"\"can't you know fly to the Netherlands or\"\"France whatever and get these or Japan\"\"and you you know\"\"Amazon's too expensive for you here in\"\"the US you know you've gotten zinc and\"\"titanium dioxide and zinc oxide alone is\"\"really pretty good at both UVB and UVA\"\"titanium dioxide is a little less\"\"fantastic at the UVA but they're both\"\"they're both good and you know in\"\"combination they're wonderful\"\"unfortunately they're the ones that are\"\"going to make you look white you know I\"\"have the white film so you know there's\"\"that and so selecting ones that they\"\"have you know micro-sized the the zinc\"\"and titanium dioxide can kind of help\"\"with that\"\"so yeah just a little fun sunscreen\"\"facts and one have you as I pull out the\"\"Bioderma and we head into January with\"\"yet another French sunscreen Bioderma\"\"hopefully I'm saying that right I hey\"\"you know I have a real mental block I\"\"practice sign oven all the time like\"\"when you guys are sleeping on the\"\"charger I'm like practicing saying that\"\"and I swear soon as the camera turns on\"\"I just like cannot say it correctly and\"\"it drives me nuts when I'm editing I\"\"just like want to punch myself drives me\"\"nuts I hate you know I'm mispronouncing\"\"things and I just think you know\"\"language is really you know that and\"\"opposable thumbs it's sort of what\"\"separates us from you know Google if you\"\"although Google can pronounce things\"\"better than I can\"\"anyways guys I hope you enjoyed the vlog\"\"I'm going to flip this off and probably\"\"rinse off some of the fragrance honestly\"\"maybe and come in with you Sarah be\"\"moisturizing cream\"\"the tub that my mom has this is kind of\"\"her her skincare on when he's I mean\"\"talk about a minimalist this is all\"\"really at my mom has going on in night\"\"time skincare routine I think she just\"\"slathered this all over herself and\"\"calls it done like no mouthing no serum\"\"none of that just just just the tub but\"\"anyways guys I hope you enjoyed the vlog\"\"today if you liked it give it a thumbs\"\"up share it with your friends and as\"\"always don't forget I'm screen and\"\"subscribe you guys tomorrow bye\"\"[Music]\"\"hi today I'm reviewing the Bioderma\"\"photo derm Max cream and really quick I\"\"just want to say it purchase all these\"\"products with my own money\"\"I'll never waste your time with\"\"sponsored ads or videos so if you want\"\"to help support the channel check out no\"\"BS Beauty comm check out my patreon\"\"community or click on the Amazon link\"\"below okay so finally getting to the\"\"other Bioderma sunscreen i have and now\"\"that i found more sites that I can smell\"\"the products in I'm excited I've got\"\"three more in my cart although I don't\"\"really need three more but I just want\"\"to try them all and they're on sale\"\"so anyway I'm really getting good at the\"\"smuggling stuff I don't have to take it\"\"up a notch - maybe like acids maybe\"\"start smuggling in some really good BHA\"\"products I don't know I guess I'll I'll\"\"see what I can move up to in the world\"\"okay so Bioderma calls this a sunscreen\"\"with cellular bio protection patent to\"\"improve skins defenses against the Sun\"\"UVA protection of 42 and UVB protection\"\"of 50 plus and when they talk about UVA\"\"protection of 42 they are going off the\"\"PPD persistent pigment darkening\"\"gradient system and I believe anything\"\"that's a 16 and over is like rated the\"\"best or like PA with four pluses after\"\"it and this one's got 42 so 16 is great\"\"42 is like out of this world which is\"\"amazing okay nourishing cream that is\"\"easy to spread the skin is protecting\"\"hydrated fragrance free non comedogenic\"\"hypoallergenic and water resistant okay\"\"so I get to my first criteria which is\"\"packaging and you know I noticed a lot\"\"of sunscreens come in yellow bottles I\"\"don't know why that is but so many of\"\"them do it just as looking through all\"\"my thumbnails I'm like yellow yellow\"\"yellow what ones that one is that anyway\"\"I don't quite get it but I have no\"\"problem with it in terms of denatured or\"\"drying types of alcohol this does not\"\"contain any of those it does contain C\"\"20-22 alcohols which are fatty types of\"\"alcohol which are good or\"\"hydrating foreskin so I don't know so\"\"many of these alcohols contain a lot of\"\"alcohol but Bioderma to figure out how\"\"to do it without it\"\"so what are they doing or what do they\"\"know that all these other brands don't I\"\"don't know they know something okay so I\"\"get to fragrance and there's no\"\"fragrance ingredients although it has a\"\"very very mild almost like corn smell\"\"like it smells a little bit like corn\"\"but it goes away pretty quickly I don't\"\"know how else describe maybe cornbread\"\"just a very light almost barely\"\"noticeable scent my nose is very\"\"sensitive though so I don't know but\"\"it's not bad doesn't bother me so the\"\"manufacturing location for this one is\"\"France so no issues with that SPF on\"\"this one is 50 plus and since made in\"\"France they are only allowed to go up to\"\"50 so anything with a 50 plus indicates\"\"really good coverage probably 60 or\"\"above from what I'm hearing from you\"\"guys so it's pretty impressive\"\"protection from UVB rays then we get to\"\"the UVA protection factor and this one\"\"is excellent far far above average this\"\"has like a plus plus UVA protection the\"\"PPD level is 42 or PPD number anything\"\"over 20 on the PPD number is considered\"\"awesome great excellent 16 above is\"\"passing I guess so the protection of\"\"this one is just ridiculously high which\"\"makes a great option for those who spend\"\"a lot of time outside those who have\"\"significant hyperpigmentation issues\"\"those who have a history of skin cancer\"\"makes the bio during some sunscreens a\"\"really great option so they have done an\"\"amazing job with their photo derm line\"\"I've been impressed with both of them\"\"now I'm gonna be buying more so ok the\"\"filters used for this one we've got you\"\"v'l n 539 which is also known as octo\"\"cry lean which is an oil soluble\"\"chemical sunscreen agent which protects\"\"skin in the UVB range and somewhat in\"\"the UVA range and it's also one that\"\"helps evil bends on be a bit more stable\"\"more effective and it's also one that\"\"people can have a lot of allergies to I\"\"think it's one of the more common\"\"ingredients where people are reporting\"\"side effects or allergies from it so\"\"keep that one in mind\"\"then we've got tin sorb M which is a\"\"hybrid filter that both reflects and\"\"absorbs both UVB and UVA rays which is\"\"impressive\"\"then we've got Evo Ben's own there we go\"\"the UVA reabsorb ER and then tensor s\"\"filter a very photostable filter which\"\"absorbs both UVB and UVA rays so a\"\"pretty good impressive lineup of filters\"\"that they've used then we get to white\"\"cast and um I'm kind of impressed with\"\"this one so they're plies pretty nicely\"\"there's a very very mild white cast I\"\"know right now it looks pretty blinding\"\"but once it absorbs it's more mild so\"\"not super super noticeable and the more\"\"it absorbs into skin the less it looks\"\"but it is a mild very mild white cast\"\"and how the longer you wear it the less\"\"its noticeable but if you're gonna\"\"reapply it that also becomes a bit more\"\"of an issue because the white cast\"\"you're playing over foundation and\"\"things like that so we'll talk more\"\"about reapplying things and half and you\"\"have to do it during the live stream but\"\"anyway once it absorbs the white cast is\"\"very very mild not super noticeable then\"\"we've got texture which it's got kind of\"\"a lotion aid cream texture to it which\"\"absorbs pretty quickly once you smooth\"\"it in once it absorbs though it sets to\"\"kind of a sticky and tacky finish it's\"\"almost like it doesn't fully feel like\"\"it dries down so if you apply foundation\"\"over it it's not gonna be as big of a\"\"deal but it is very slightly tacky and\"\"kind of sticky not as bad as some other\"\"ones I've tried like the drunk elephant\"\"sunscreens those are always super\"\"to me but it is slightly sticky and\"\"tacky and I would say the finish for\"\"this one is slightly radiant if you like\"\"a matte finish their photo fluid while I\"\"reviewed is kind of a better option but\"\"this one sets to kind of a more natural\"\"radiant finish which is slightly sticky\"\"so not the worst not the best but pretty\"\"decent still overall then we get to\"\"ease-of-use and it does take a bit of\"\"smoothing and effort to really apply it\"\"and to get it to smooth over evenly\"\"takes a bit of effort the texture is\"\"rather hydrating so this works better my\"\"opinion if you apply it directly over a\"\"serum instead of using like you\"\"typically in the morning I'll use a\"\"essence then a serum and then a\"\"moisturizer and then my sunscreen this\"\"one works better if you just eliminate\"\"the moisturizer step and just apply it\"\"directly over a serum just because it is\"\"rather hydrating seems to feel like it\"\"creates a bit of a seal over skin which\"\"is probably because the water resistance\"\"so it can be a bit fussy to apply\"\"certain foundations over them usually\"\"foundations that are rather hydrating or\"\"amoliant can be a bit iffy to apply over\"\"and then foundations that are super\"\"matte can also be a bit tricky but\"\"overall it's still pretty easy to use\"\"it's just not dummy-proof which is\"\"probably why it took me a month to\"\"figure it out no I'm just kidding haha\"\"I'm so funny I really can be funny when\"\"I try though so anyway okay\"\"antioxidants and beneficial ingredients\"\"in this one but a lot of hydrating and\"\"moisturizing ingredients a lot of slip\"\"ingredients in this one we've also got a\"\"few good ingredients we've got mannitol\"\"xylitol fructooligosaccharides which are\"\"great hydrating and moisturizing\"\"ingredients then we've got Ram nose ROM\"\"nose which is a ingredient which has\"\"demonstrated positive effects in both\"\"epidermal and dermal compartments of\"\"in-vitro reconstructed skin moreover\"\"such in vitro findings were obtained\"\"that has an effect on collagen four and\"\"pro-collagen one per day\"\"action so that's great for skin then\"\"we've got a ingredient which is known\"\"abroad which is a brown seaweed known as\"\"antelope kine\"\"6 I'm sure I slaughtered the name of\"\"that it's an ingredient that helps\"\"protect skin from oxidative stress\"\"caused by over exposure to sunlight so\"\"that makes it a natural fit for a\"\"sunscreen it's also rich in plant\"\"sterols that support the skin in a wide\"\"range of ways and then we've got act\"\"eine which is an ingredient that helps\"\"protect the skin from environmental\"\"stressors such as natural item\"\"pollutants so we don't have a super long\"\"list of antioxidants and beneficial\"\"ingredients but we do have some AB note\"\"and a lot of ammonia ingredients so\"\"overall I was kind of impressed with it\"\"I don't know at least some of the\"\"ingredients that they included as\"\"beneficial ingredients actually play\"\"directly to a sunscreen instead of just\"\"some random things so I don't know\"\"overall I was happy with it then we've\"\"got acne genic ingredients and this\"\"surprised me because it does have a bit\"\"of a thicker creamy texture to it but it\"\"only has one ingredient of note for acne\"\"prone skin which is paid 100 stearate\"\"which is a slightly comedogenic\"\"ingredient but that's it so overall I\"\"was pretty impressed with that so if you\"\"have acne prone skin this is a great\"\"option and there's not a lot of really\"\"great options out there so this is a\"\"good one then we get to animal testing\"\"and unfortunately Bioderma is not\"\"cruelty free which I always every time I\"\"review a product if there's I was up to\"\"Google cuz I was thinking the back of my\"\"head they are but they're not so that's\"\"important to note there we get to\"\"performance and this one will absolutely\"\"highly protect your skin from sun damage\"\"from uva and UVB rays highly protect\"\"your skin like very good protection\"\"lasts pretty well throughout the day it\"\"can become a little bit greasy towards\"\"the very end of the day after 8 or 9\"\"hours of wear it can start to look a\"\"little shiny but not tear\"\"believe so overall I was pretty\"\"impressed with this sunscreen for so\"\"many reasons high protection several\"\"unique beneficial ingredients great for\"\"acne prone skin well packaged well\"\"formulated so overall I was more\"\"impressed than not so then we get to the\"\"price and this is the full size which is\"\"1.33 ounces 40 milliliters which is a\"\"bit tinier than most other sunscreens\"\"also in a retails for about $24 making\"\"it 60 cents a milliliter making it a bit\"\"more expensive per milliliter than a lot\"\"of other sunscreens I've reviewed but\"\"it's still rather affordable for\"\"something that's so effective so overall\"\"with a 15 being a perfect score this one\"\"got a 14 which is pretty darn good yeah\"\"so anyway I'm interested in hearing from\"\"you guys if you've had a chance to try\"\"this one out and if you have what your\"\"thoughts are or if you've tried in the\"\"other Bioderma sunscreens out what have\"\"you tried and how have you liked it so\"\"leave a comment I love hearing from you\"\"guys be sure to join us on our\"\"livestream May 2nd at 2 p.m. Central\"\"Time and thank you guys so much\"\"hey everyone its Michelle welcome back\"\"to my channel in today's video I am\"\"finally doing another sunscreen Sunday\"\"and it's on one of my favorite sunscreen\"\"finds this year and that is the biodome\"\"or photo durham SPF 50 plus milk high\"\"protection sunscreen I'm actually almost\"\"finished this sunscreen and I figured\"\"it's about time that I do a review on\"\"this before I fully run out of this\"\"product\"\"it says the photo derm milk SPF 50 plus\"\"offers a large spectrum protection\"\"against some harmful ultraviolet rays of\"\"the Sun it's anti UVA UVB filter system\"\"and it's exclusive formula provide a\"\"scientifically proved high protection\"\"non-comedogenic will not clog pores\"\"other claims based on the Bioderma\"\"canada website when i last looked at it\"\"or that it's suitable for babies\"\"children teens adult for the face and\"\"body smooth texture colourless upon\"\"application no greasy effect no white\"\"traces a uva of 42 and i actually got\"\"that from the Shoppers Drug Mart website\"\"that it's a UVA but 42 fragrance free\"\"paraben free hyper allergenic\"\"and moisturizing I purchased this for\"\"twenty seven ninety Canadian dollars\"\"this comes in a hundred mil tube and I\"\"picked this up at Shoppers Drug Mart\"\"it's an all chemical sunscreen and the\"\"filters are one of the main reasons why\"\"this is in my top sunscreen pics of the\"\"year it has 10% Arctic raylene 6% tina\"\"sorb m 5% April been zone and 2.5% Tina\"\"sorb s we've all heard of Australian and\"\"AVO been Zone in Western sunscreens but\"\"the fact that it has both Tina sorb M &\"\"S which are very photo stable filters\"\"that have very good UVA protection and\"\"the fact that you could purchase this so\"\"easily over the counter at your local\"\"shoppers Drug Mart or a rec hall is\"\"incredible as you can hear this is quite\"\"a liquidy sunscreen and it comes in a\"\"tube packaging and again I don't like\"\"the packaging for as you can see that\"\"buildup is nasty here's the swatch on my\"\"hand as you can see it's a bit of like a\"\"thick lotion type of texture because it\"\"is still running down my hand although\"\"very slowly now I'm just gonna rub it\"\"into my hand now as you can see it's\"\"very smooth like this actually doesn't\"\"feel thick at all it feels really nice\"\"and light it's also making my hand feel\"\"slightly more moisturize now I didn't\"\"rub this in\"\"well enough but as you can see there is\"\"a slight cast on this hand here compared\"\"to my hand without the sunscreen and I'm\"\"just gonna rub it in a little bit more\"\"and keep in mind this is still like on\"\"initial application so it doesn't look\"\"ask caste now compared to my hand\"\"without it and it actually makes my skin\"\"look more even tone definitely shinier\"\"on this side as well but definitely more\"\"moisturized on this hand as for\"\"fragrance it's not noticeable at all\"\"unless you actually actively go like\"\"this and even then I can't describe what\"\"the scent is it's not unpleasant it's\"\"not overly industrial chemically\"\"smelling I would say there is like maybe\"\"a slight sour type of smell to it but it\"\"doesn't smell rotten or anything like\"\"that but again it's not a noticeable\"\"scent at all when I apply it on my face\"\"when I apply it on my face I actually\"\"try to apply it in two separate layers\"\"and I find by doing this it glides on\"\"the skin it very easily and it feels\"\"nice and light and as you can see on\"\"initial application there looks like\"\"there's a cast going on but as you can\"\"see in the clip 10 to 15 minutes later\"\"the cast subsided and I actually noticed\"\"the undertone in my skin still after\"\"waiting in the 10 to 15 minutes I\"\"definitely noticed my skin looks a lot\"\"shinier but it also looks a bit more\"\"even tone in terms of the feel it almost\"\"feels like I added an extra moisturizer\"\"on to my skin but this is definitely not\"\"as rich as the Bioderma outer derm\"\"intensive balm that I use that one is\"\"very rich whereas this one it feels like\"\"it just leaves a nice moisturized layer\"\"on top of the skin this hasn't a\"\"waterproof claims on the packaging here\"\"it says apply generously prior to sun\"\"exposure\"\"reapply as needed or after swimming\"\"towel drying perspiring heavily and\"\"washing for extra skin benefits like I\"\"mentioned prior in terms of the feel it\"\"does feel like this adds a little bit\"\"extra moisture to my skin but one of the\"\"bigger skin benefits I've noticed when\"\"using this sunscreen is that my\"\"pigmentation has faded significantly in\"\"my current skincare routine I am using\"\"azelaic acid and different and I find\"\"both of those in my routine have\"\"actually helped lighten any pigmentation\"\"I have on my face but in the summertime\"\"I do freckle a lot and actually on the\"\"top part of my cheeks right here I am\"\"noticing some residual pigmentation and\"\"for the women in my family I've noticed\"\"this is the spot right here where they\"\"have received age spot\"\"but while using this in this some are\"\"actually noticed this never darkened at\"\"all and I never even got any freckles\"\"and usually all the freckles are around\"\"my nose and I haven't seen any this year\"\"this is an uneducated guess but my\"\"assumption is because there is some\"\"silicone in this product and it does\"\"make my skin look smoother and I also\"\"don't find this emphasizes any texture\"\"on my skin at all especially my large\"\"pores right here and on my forehead I\"\"find that texture never comes to the\"\"forefront when I use this foundation if\"\"anything it looks slightly subsided not\"\"blurring but subsided in terms of makeup\"\"in the summertime what I did was mostly\"\"mix a primer with that drunk elephant D\"\"bronzy just to give myself a little bit\"\"of a tint right now I am wearing this\"\"product underneath the foundation I am\"\"wearing Mac Studio sculpt foundation in\"\"the color NC 20 did n't go in with my\"\"touch of primer I just went in right\"\"away with the foundation after waiting\"\"the 10 to 15 minutes and powdered a\"\"little bit in my t-zone and I really\"\"like how my skin looks right now\"\"I believe I have tried the it cosmetics\"\"CC cream with this product as well and I\"\"never noticed it disrupting my makeup at\"\"all so for the overall pros for the\"\"sunscreen first point is the high UVA\"\"protection this is formulated with some\"\"highly sought after photo stable filters\"\"that is not easily found in the Western\"\"market especially for those of you that\"\"live in the u.s. so for those of us that\"\"are Canadian or live close to the\"\"Canadian border this is very easy to get\"\"at a local Rexel or Shoppers Drug Mart\"\"store also another pro is I find it a\"\"great amount for the price I mean 100\"\"mils for less than $30 is really good\"\"they have this product and one of those\"\"large spray bottles so I don't know if\"\"the formula is slightly different from\"\"this so I was thinking of checking that\"\"out just because it comes in a larger\"\"amount I also like that I can use this\"\"both on my face and body I don't find\"\"this a greasy product at all despite its\"\"moisturizing effect and another pro is\"\"actually that despite it being an all\"\"chemical sunscreen this does not sting\"\"my eyes at all one of the biggest cons\"\"for this products like I mentioned is\"\"the fact that it can produce a cast\"\"although today it looked like it didn't\"\"give me that much of a cast for good\"\"measure I still like going in with some\"\"type of complexion makeup product I feel\"\"like even with the sheer foundation the\"\"cast on this is still fairly easy to\"\"cover another con and it kind of depends\"\"on what your skin type is like but this\"\"does\"\"use quite a bit of shine not just my\"\"face on my body as well so for those of\"\"you that are oily skin and tend to stay\"\"away from shinier products just keep in\"\"mind when you use this I would say a\"\"better option for those of you with oily\"\"skin for a high SPF and you be a\"\"protecting product is the LA roche-posay\"\"Anthelios lotion not the one that's\"\"tinted but the regular one that one is\"\"an all chemical filter sunscreen and I\"\"find it does produce a bit more of a\"\"matte finish so I think you'd like that\"\"better than this one overall despite the\"\"cast and the shine it gives this\"\"sunscreen has been one of my favorite\"\"sunscreens to date and you'll definitely\"\"be seeing this in my best of beauty\"\"skincare Edition around up and that is\"\"it for this sunscreen Sunday I do hope\"\"you found this video helpful and\"\"informative if you did please be sure to\"\"give this video a like subscribe to my\"\"channel down below for future videos\"\"leave a comment if you have any\"\"questions or recommendations and I'll\"\"see you all soon ciao\"\"you\"\n"

      "\"hello guys and welcome to my channel my\"\"name is jesper fussing and today we are\"\"going to look at a sunscreen and we're\"\"going to do at one of these those tinted\"\"ones and what you would like to know is\"\"how does it actually look color wise\"\"so we're firstly the one we are talking\"\"about today is the one from bioderma and\"\"it looks like this and the embellish\"\"looks like this or the packaging looks\"\"like this and first of all yes you would\"\"like to know what is the spf and that is\"\"a  a plus on this one here and it says\"\"that it has the uva in a circle and\"\"actually it was so difficult to see it i\"\"couldn't really find it on the tube\"\"itself but when i looked at the\"\"packaging i could see that down here it\"\"says that it has the uva in a circle so\"\"that means that it is at least a / uva\"\"compared to the uvb so compared to the\"\"spf now one other thing is that normally\"\"i like to use well that's not quite true\"\"because the one i use does not have any\"\"star ratings on it and that is the one\"\"from la roche posay dia on tinted\"\"version but it is a good idea if you can\"\"find something with this star rating on\"\"it and if you have at least a  to \"\"stars and that is something i would use\"\"if i went to the beach or if i knew i\"\"had to be out in the sun for a long time\"\"but just for daily use i use the one\"\"from la roche posay which is with a uv\"\"in a circle but it doesn't have any a\"\"star rating now this one here has the uv\"\"inner circle but i know star rating so\"\"we can't really talk about that and what\"\"you would like to know is how is the\"\"color well if you look at how are they\"\"making the colours in this sort of\"\"products then when they have attended\"\"version and the la roche-posay us that\"\"had a has a tinted version and the\"\"bioderma has a tinted aversion and other\"\"companies has tinted versions as well\"\"but for those three that i mentioned\"\"they are using\"\"something called iron oxides and they\"\"are using a yellow oxide a red and a\"\"black oxide and then they are using it\"\"to tenem oxide as well the titanium\"\"oxide is what will give you the sun\"\"protection or what would be the sun\"\"screen itself but this one here has a\"\"chemical filters in it as well as the\"\"event one is a purely a mineral\"\"sunscreen so why do i mention the\"\"titanium oxide well i do that because it\"\"is very white and that is obviously\"\"something that they are also using in\"\"order to lighten the color of a product\"\"so it's not so dark also it comes up to\"\"the color that they wanted because when\"\"i just said so is not so dark well the\"\"whole thing about these tinted\"\"moisturizers hood tinted sunscreen as\"\"these ones are is that it it's almost\"\"sort of like one color is supposed to\"\"fit all and i think we all know that one\"\"color certainly does not fit all\"\"so for sunscreens that i attended it\"\"should be just like for makeup so for\"\"foundations and a lot of companies are\"\"really good at that now and some\"\"companies are not that good and i would\"\"say that if you are still making a\"\"sunscreen which is a one color fits or\"\"maybe you have not really understood the\"\"message so we are reviewing this one\"\"anyway so what i would say about the\"\"iron oxide is that the difference is\"\"that in this one here and the one from\"\"even then the first ingredients of the\"\"oxides so as they are listed in the\"\"ingredients list is the yellow oxide and\"\"that means yellow iron oxide and that\"\"means of course that that product is a\"\"little bit more oranjee whereas the one\"\"from the hospice aid that is so that the\"\"red iron oxide is listed first so there\"\"is more red iron oxide in the one from a\"\"large person and there are in the ones\"\"from oven and from a higher term\"\"and that you can already think gives a\"\"sort of a difference in how the color is\"\"is more red or is it more orange ii and\"\"then they also have a black iron oxide\"\"in it in order to make it more well\"\"darker so it is obviously the mix about\"\"for those iron oxide that are making up\"\"at a color so kind of like if you are\"\"looking at a product you can read from\"\"an ingredients list if they have the\"\"yellow iron oxide listed above the red\"\"iron oxide then it is more to the orange\"\"side and vice versa it would be more red\"\"and i would say that the brown from la\"\"roche-posay is a it is red it is not\"\"orange ii i would say it it comes across\"\"as being too red so yes should we try\"\"this one here and as i always say just\"\"take something out and this one you can\"\"sign it's a big liquidy so it's not\"\"kinda like super fatty it's more like\"\"liquidy and i think they are actually\"\"saying that it is now it says in french\"\"maybe it says an image and it says aqua\"\"fluid tante tres odor protection\"\"protection is it spanish as french i\"\"don't really do french i just try my\"\"best but it tended aqua fluid very high\"\"air protection that's the english\"\"version for you that so sell it our bio\"\"protection i mean what you like to know\"\"is the color so let's have a look so you\"\"can just see it is kind of like really\"\"liquidy so kinda like crips out of there\"\"this one here and it really looks like\"\"well something it looks like a makeup\"\"cream very good makeup cream and it\"\"maybe if you can see the color compared\"\"to my skin my skin is definitely not a\"\"tent at the moment because i am\"\"basically staying indoors due to the\"\"situation that we are all in so i don't\"\"have that much sun and also means that i\"\"actually not used a sunscreen for a long\"\"time because i am basically indoors\"\"every day so how does it look it's very\"\"very liquid is very easy to distribute\"\"so it has this sort of a column but what\"\"our lightest show is that a lot of\"\"people they are using so little\"\"sunscreen so where this one here has the\"\"same weight as the one from the wash per\"\"se and when i use the one from the\"\"hospice a i know i need to use half a\"\"teaspoon of the teaspoons that i have\"\"your teaspoon might look a different\"\"might be small that might be bigger so i\"\"just have measured and you can see a\"\"video about that up there i will link to\"\"that one how to find out how much\"\"sunscreen to actually use so that for me\"\"would be kind of like half a of these\"\"teaspoons here so now you can maybe\"\"already see that them if i maybe can\"\"tilt it is very liquid about trying it a\"\"little bit you can maybe see how it\"\"looks how much it is and that is for my\"\"entire face and when i put it into my\"\"hand i have to remember that a lot of\"\"the cream will stick in my hand so\"\"basically it is better just to dip my\"\"finger in and then go along and then do\"\"it like that\"\"now i'm only doing one side i only have\"\"to use half of the amount but you can\"\"already see it gives kind of a big\"\"splash so this will just go on here and\"\"you can see that it will definitely\"\"change the color of my face so you will\"\"see that this side by its on and this i\"\"don't have anything on today i only have\"\"a summer setting powder on i don't have\"\"any foundation on or something like that\"\"so it is just sitting about a little bit\"\"of a highlight not to look at too tall\"\"on camera so this is a kind of like how\"\"it will look and yes i can smear it out\"\"and smeared out and smeared and continue\"\"to smear it out and a lot of it will be\"\"taken up by my hands but that was not\"\"the point the point was that i need to\"\"leave it on the skin because it\"\"is there for a certain purpose and that\"\"is in order to protect me from the sun\"\"so when as you can see this is rather a\"\"lot of stuff to put on and just put it\"\"on my forehead so it is i mean one thing\"\"to say is that it is very easy to\"\"distribute it really easy to distribute\"\"it's very liquidy and so on i don't we\"\"don't want maya to put this so i put it\"\"there so don't want to have it all over\"\"the place but yeah how do i think the\"\"color is when i see it directly and not\"\"through the camera where i know that the\"\"color would be a little bit different\"\"but i would say it definitely is not as\"\"orangie or it's not as red as the la\"\"roche-posay one so and it's not as when\"\"i spoke about the event mineral one i\"\"compared it to a chocolate ice cream\"\"that i had as a child and which was kind\"\"of like um can i get grayish undertone\"\"into the brown where i would definitely\"\"not say that\"\"this is like that so i would say this is\"\"maybe color wise if you can maybe still\"\"see it this is kind of like i'm\"\"something in-between the one from our\"\"then and the one from la roche-posay but\"\"um yeah i mean the other thing to\"\"remember about these things here is that\"\"they will actually act a little bit like\"\"a foundation and when you are putting\"\"foundation on you will use a setting\"\"spray or you can use a setting powder\"\"afterwards and i would say that that is\"\"exactly the same that you need to do\"\"when using something like this because\"\"what happens is that i had it on my face\"\"for several hours at the other day and\"\"what very quickly happened was that it\"\"started to run into the crease lines\"\"around lines you get around the nose\"\"when you're moving your face so it very\"\"quickly went in there and i mean on\"\"camera it would have looked nice but in\"\"reality when people looked up close they\"\"would be able to see that it all seeped\"\"into all the\"\"lines in one's face all the mickey lines\"\"that you get did it i know in my eyes\"\"well not to begin with it took a little\"\"while i would say it took maybe a couple\"\"of hours and i did actually put it on\"\"very liberal on my eyelids and it did as\"\"in other lines on the face in the\"\"creased line on the eyelid it it very\"\"soon just ended up being a read a line\"\"as their so yes again that you wouldn't\"\"have needed to use some sort of a\"\"setting powder in order to keep it a\"\"fixed so we didn't or my eyes yes it did\"\"annoy my eyes after a couple of hours\"\"and i felt i just needed to take it away\"\"and in order i thought maybe it's just\"\"because my eyes are limpid dry or\"\"whatever but then as soon as i took it\"\"off and it was in the evening when i\"\"took it off so it was not like okay it\"\"has been a long day\"\"my eyes are tired and so on because as\"\"soon as i took it off and i don't\"\"normally have it like that when i don't\"\"have a sunscreen so i immediately i took\"\"it off and i didn't have that annoying\"\"feeling any longer\"\"so clearly it was the sunscreen that\"\"annoyed my eyes and i would say with the\"\"la roche-posay one i used the untainted\"\"one and it has never annoyed my eyes and\"\"they do say that i'd use some sort of a\"\"anti i sting technology and i'm not\"\"saying that that works really well and i\"\"wouldn't say it does not leave any sort\"\"of a cast on the face so if you would\"\"like to have a sunscreen that doesn't\"\"leave a cast on your face i would say\"\"that the amount from a large per se is a\"\"really good choice for many reasons and\"\"this stuff here i will say that it's not\"\"as bad as the event one which started to\"\"really like burn around my eyes on the\"\"eyelids around this very the eyes the\"\"the area underneath my eye it started to\"\"warm and get the sort of burning\"\"sensation that just became worse and\"\"worse and worse i did not have it with\"\"this one here to the same degree as i\"\"had with the event one of us just like a\"\"little\"\"it but it it wasn't that much i know my\"\"eyes it was more like receiving into my\"\"eyes and annoyed the eye itself so yes\"\"this is how it looks and is it something\"\"i will use no it is not and it feels\"\"another thing to say is that it feels\"\"crazy it's easy to distribute on your\"\"face but it just has this drawback that\"\"it's it's it's really crazy and it keeps\"\"being greasy and there when i looked in\"\"the mirror when i was outside it really\"\"did shine to high heaven so it really\"\"looked really glossy so yes this is not\"\"something i can recommend but if you\"\"can't help yourself but wanting to try\"\"it try it out see how the color works\"\"and let me know it works for you if you\"\"would like to see more the sort of\"\"videos please subscribe in tibetan to\"\"all those things to know to be notified\"\"when i put more disabilities thank you\"\"for watching see you bye\"\"hi i'm melina cop the pimple calm and\"\"today i want to talk to you about\"\"once again my favorite brand that\"\"doesn't pay me for these videos yes i'm\"\"not sponsored by this friend but i love\"\"them so much that i will shout my love\"\"for them from the rooftops every day i\"\"mean seriously i have converted so many\"\"people onto this brand that it's not\"\"even funny\"\"today i'm talking about bio derma and\"\"specifically since you know i am like\"\"the biggest a sunscreen fan ever like as\"\"in i intend to look  for the rest of\"\"my life the reason that i can look \"\"for the rest of my life like the one\"\"thing that allows me to do that is\"\"sunscreen and so today i'm going to be\"\"talking about the bioderma\"\"photo derm range of sunscreens so\"\"bioderma has many different ranges they\"\"have ranges for sensitive skin the sense\"\"of bio range they have ranges for\"\"dehydrated skin and the hydra bio range\"\"they have a range for acne prone skin\"\"the sebum range and they have the photo\"\"derm range it's the orange one this\"\"range is amazing because it's sunscreen\"\"and the thing that i love about bioderma\"\"they provide broad-spectrum protection\"\"and they are often you know fragrance\"\"free and water resistance and these are\"\"things that you want to look for in a\"\"sunscreen in order to get adequate\"\"protection it's really really important\"\"that you wear your sunscreen\"\"you should watch my sunscreen video to\"\"learn more about you know the difference\"\"between chemical and mineral sunscreens\"\"and all the rest of it basically there\"\"is no better one as long as you wear\"\"sunscreen that's good the best sunscreen\"\"is the sunscreen that you actually put\"\"on your face the best sunscreen is the\"\"sunscreen that protects you but i mean\"\"there are brands out there that are\"\"terrible that don't actually live up to\"\"their labels like neutrogena so i do not\"\"use brands in you know the typical\"\"sunscreen aisle\"\"in the like a big store like walmart i\"\"don't know i only used sunscreens from\"\"two brands ok bioderma or polish choice\"\"that's it i am like very elitist with my\"\"sunscreen it has to be the best the best\"\"the best the best because as you know\"\"many sunscreens clog your pores and for\"\"me being you know skin health coach it\"\"would kind of be a little weird if i was\"\"using products that clogged my skin and\"\"many sunscreens in like natural skincare\"\"ranges contains so many different kinds\"\"of oils that they i don't know how they\"\"even protect the skin from the sun given\"\"that a lot of them have oils high up on\"\"the ingredient list that you know oils\"\"kind of attract the sun as opposed to\"\"repel the sun's on oil based sunscreen\"\"and no idea how that works from a\"\"chemical perspective but i know what it\"\"does so on a poor level it clogs it\"\"clogs it clogs your pores so i have all\"\"of these sunscreens from bioderma and\"\"i'm gonna include the hydra bio spf \"\"in this because it is a very very good\"\"but if you want to hear about my review\"\"on this and watch the hydra bio range\"\"video because this is an amazing a\"\"little everyday sunscreen so ok let's\"\"begin with me be the body sunscreen\"\"because many of us forget that our body\"\"actually tends under the clothes as well\"\"especially you know in the summer when\"\"the sun is so bright and so high\"\"especially depending on where you are in\"\"the world you know you can really cause\"\"some real damage and you don't want to\"\"just protect your face your whole body\"\"kind of matters you know and i think\"\"it's very important to wear sun\"\"protection liberally on your whole body\"\"in the summer and i love this because\"\"look how huge it is it is \"\"milliliters of spray sunscreen so you\"\"can kind of get to hard-to-reach places\"\"by spraying it i warn you this nozzle is\"\"very very strong this is spf  photo\"\"derm max but it depends on where you are\"\"in the world because i believe in canada\"\"they only have spf  in this size and\"\"in this product so bioderma\"\"is available literally all around the\"\"world that's what i love about them\"\"that's why i choose by odor mites i\"\"pretty much can find it in any pharmacy\"\"around of the world so i love how\"\"accessible it is and i love how well\"\"formulated the products are and i love\"\"that they're broad-spectrum protection\"\"so you get uva protection as well this\"\"one it does have an invisible texture\"\"even though it comes out white and it\"\"spreads very easily so i really like it\"\"but my favorite thing is like how big it\"\"is\"\"well how much sunscreen i get bioderma\"\"products are really well priced for what\"\"they are for another one that covers the\"\"body but can also work on the face this\"\"is the photo derm sensitive spf  this\"\"is literally probably the highest\"\"protection you can get because it has\"\"very high uva protection\"\"it's almost as high as the uvb\"\"protection here and what i love about\"\"bioderma sunscreens is that they often\"\"will put the actual uva rating as well\"\"as the uvb rating but they only do this\"\"in europe keep that in mind because the\"\"rating system hasn't been universally\"\"agreed upon yet around the world so like\"\"asia has their own rating system europe\"\"has their own rating system the us\"\"doesn't have a rating system the fda is\"\"trying to figure that out now but europe\"\"is more stringent on ingredients there\"\"really like on top of their i really\"\"like that they actually you know do a\"\"rating system and it kind of allows you\"\"to know like this sunscreens has better\"\"broad-spectrum protection then this\"\"sunscreen you know the rating system\"\"does help because some sunscreens have\"\"like a uva rating of you know  some \"\"some  and so i choose the highest\"\"possible uva protection because uva rays\"\"are the ones that are going to jack up\"\"your collagen make your pores weak and\"\"saggy and more prone to acne so i'm like\"\"you no no no no thank you no thank you\"\"this is a thicker product its extreme\"\"milk very high protection photosensitive\"\"skin water resistance and without\"\"fragrance and it's without parabens for\"\"those people who are afraid of paraben\"\"all the bio dermis and\"\"means our without parabens and you do\"\"either without fragrance i believe as\"\"well as far as i can see yep fragrance\"\"for me very very good product this one\"\"you can use on your body for like\"\"extremely high protection this is for\"\"those people who you know burn at the\"\"slightest bit of the sun amazing amazing\"\"protection or like if you're out on the\"\"beach where the highest protection\"\"possible like do it you know and try\"\"obviously to protect yourself like an\"\"umbrella out some protective clothing\"\"hats sunglasses so that you're not\"\"burning your skin like it's just not a\"\"good idea that tans are stupid\"\"get some self-tanner get a fake tan\"\"that's what i do take down and i've used\"\"this on both the face and the body it's\"\"thick on the face but still does an\"\"amazing job this is something i would\"\"wear if i'm literally out in the sun\"\"which is something i tried to avoid\"\"doing but if like i'm at the beach and\"\"this is the sunscreen i'll probably be\"\"using on my face i also have this one\"\"this is a photo duramax spf  i'm not\"\"sure that this is even available in\"\"north america because in north america i\"\"believe that anything above an spf  is\"\"not sold and it's not that it's not sold\"\"because it doesn't work or whatever it's\"\"just that this is what happens with spf\"\"spf  protects you from % of the race\"\"so % still get in spf  protects you\"\"from % of the race so you know\"\"anything above an spf  is kind of\"\"almost the same as an spf  but when i\"\"got this product i think i didn't see\"\"anything else so i'm like i'm just\"\"taking it and this is very high\"\"protection for a sensitive skin and it's\"\"a fluid texture so the texture is very\"\"light but i do find it can ball up on\"\"top of certain things so with some\"\"screens you might find that if you use\"\"like a silicone\"\"product underneath things your sunscreen\"\"might fall up and it's just a matter of\"\"experimenting to find like the perfect\"\"combination of products that work\"\"together that don't make the sunscreen\"\"fall up but what i do with this one in\"\"particular is i wear it on my morning\"\"i just simply washed my face and without\"\"anything on my face on my dry face i\"\"applied this sunscreen go for a run come\"\"back wash it off and then do the rest of\"\"my skincare routine i don't wear spf \"\"every single day but what i do do is i\"\"wear do you do i wear spf  every\"\"single day a minimum of spf  but i do\"\"wear spf  when i'm out kind of more\"\"like out and about when i know i'll be\"\"leaving the house i'm definitely wearing\"\"spf  if it's summer it's gonna be\"\"definitely spf \"\"i do spf  minimum let's say spring\"\"winter you know when i don't see so much\"\"sun but in the summer spring on days\"\"when i'm out spf  is when i aim for it\"\"because i want to get maximum protection\"\"now speaking of spf  this is what i\"\"love about bioderma they have awesome\"\"spf  these are both photo derm\"\"obviously but one is a r and one is\"\"laser\"\"they're both creams and they're both\"\"very high protection and they both have\"\"high uva ratings and all the stuff but\"\"one of them is tinted the ar is tinted\"\"so this one is tinted tinted dude these\"\"are both like a pretty light cream\"\"texture they're not heavy at all ar is\"\"tinted which i really really like it\"\"doesn't have a white task on your skin\"\"when you apply it because it's tinted\"\"but it's not like tinted as in its gonna\"\"cover all the imperfections maybe it\"\"does so just very very subtly enough for\"\"those really subtle no makeup days i\"\"think it's awesome you can still wear\"\"makeup on top if you want but i just\"\"like it on its own and it's been my\"\"go-to i tested this out thoroughly i'm\"\"almost done with in my first ever bottle\"\"of this very close to empty what i don't\"\"like about this product is that it only\"\"comes in  milliliters like it's not\"\"enough for what it is because i applying\"\"my sunscreen generously like i go a bit\"\"on with this particular sunscreen you\"\"can't be too generous because you can\"\"experience some filling\"\"when you use too much of this so you\"\"just use the amount that you need to get\"\"even coverage to protect your whole face\"\"but still this is like one of my\"\"ultimate favorite products probably ever\"\"because spf  high uva rating and also\"\"a very very good texture and it's tinted\"\"like what else does a girl need this is\"\"my go-to summer\"\"product it has been to be fair my\"\"polished tres sunscreen that is tinted\"\"but spf  is coming soon i have not\"\"fully tried like an entire bottle yet\"\"i'm only trying to sample there's very\"\"good feedback on this particular\"\"something that i'm talking about though\"\"i would love to kind of compare the two\"\"but this price point is better than the\"\"paula's choice and the spf once again is\"\"higher so even if the polished choice\"\"might be more cosmetically elegant\"\"whatever this one is still better bang\"\"for the buck spf  spf  in the summer\"\"you know yeah i really love this product\"\"but i've got the on tinted version\"\"before i got the tinted version because\"\"i didn't see the tinted version and so i\"\"have both but i prefer the tinted one\"\"even though they're both fantastic\"\"products it's just you know the tinted\"\"one you know it's just it's tinted so\"\"there's no white cast on your skin i'm\"\"not saying that they all have serious\"\"white casts but again i'm a pale person\"\"so that's something that you might want\"\"to consider like if you have darker skin\"\"they also this is the tent net you had\"\"the natural color but they have a golden\"\"color that's even darker than this one\"\"so i would consider going for the darker\"\"color so that you don't have to deal\"\"with the white cast that some sometimes\"\"sunscreens have the back white cast kind\"\"of means that the sunscreen has some\"\"good protection in there that's you know\"\"doing something protecting me i don't\"\"hate the white cast in sunscreens i\"\"always can you know even it out with\"\"some powder on top my mineral powder is\"\"plus about spf  in it you can read\"\"about it on my blog or i'll provide a\"\"link below it's very important that you\"\"wear sunscreen and throughout the day if\"\"you need to reapply your sunscreen i'm\"\"gonna do a shout out for the spray\"\"sunscreen from the hydra bio range it's\"\"not in the photo derm range but it's\"\"really really good plus the hydra by a\"\"perfect ur spf  is also an amazing\"\"everyday product for you know spring and\"\"winter like when you're not really out\"\"or like you're not leaving the house\"\"this is the product i like to wear spf\"\" minimum even when i don't leave the\"\"house that's how legit i am too legit to\"\"quit and i like to carry this one around\"\"with me in my bag so that i can reapply\"\"throughout the day like on my body\"\"specifically i really like this and what\"\"i recommend you do with in terms of\"\"makeup like if you're wearing makeup\"\"throughout the day i know you don't want\"\"to glob on more sunscreen right that's\"\"just gonna ruin your makeup and might\"\"feel gross and sticky and ridiculous so\"\"you can either do a fine mist of this\"\"but i prefer to just dust my face very\"\"generously with a powder that has spf \"\"minimum in it and broad-spectrum uva\"\"protection because mineral powders often\"\"come with zinc oxide titanium dioxide\"\"which is mineral sunscreen protection\"\"and it's really really good so you can\"\"just be very generous with the powder\"\"throughout the day that has sun\"\"protection in it so that you are\"\"reapplying so that you're continuing to\"\"be protected from the uva and uvb rays\"\"you don't want to eat your skin that's\"\"going to equal terrible skin i hope you\"\"really enjoyed this sunscreen video my\"\"dream come true a video about just\"\"sunscreen but i try and wear if you need\"\"help choosing the right sunscreen for\"\"you or if you need help like customizing\"\"your skincare routine because everyone's\"\"skin is different and i understand that\"\"choosing a good product can be super\"\"confusing and super annoying and\"\"frustrating and instead of you know\"\"wasting\"\"money and getting like really frustrated\"\"with the process we just actually work\"\"with me have a routine review service\"\"where i work directly with clients like\"\"literally over skype we chat we see each\"\"other where i learn everything about\"\"your skin type and curate like a\"\"customized am/pm skin care routine we\"\"talk about makeup everything that you\"\"need to put on your skin and then\"\"there's no guesswork there's no\"\"frustration there's no wasted money\"\"there's no clogged pores which that is\"\"so so you can check that out below i\"\"have a link to my routine review service\"\"and if you like this video give me a\"\"thumbs up let me know if you've tried\"\"any of these products in the comments\"\"below i would love to hear what you\"\"think and i'm also doing like daily\"\"almost instagram live videos where you\"\"can ask me questions live every day i\"\"call my daily powwow so that was a lot\"\"of information you're like my dad links\"\"below this video thank you so much for\"\"watching i will talk to you soon this\"\"was a winner pop the pimple bathtub\"\"hello\"\"welcome back to my channel if you are\"\"here and you are new\"\"your comment as well today we'll be\"\"talking about this bioderma photodam max\"\"spf  plus tinted cream\"\"sunscreen and i chose mine in color\"\"golden this\"\"is for sensitive skin and if you want to\"\"see\"\"how this is going to perform please keep\"\"on watching\"\"so as always my morning routine i always\"\"wash my face\"\"so that is what i normally do and you\"\"guys i'm not going to be\"\"going into detail with that i just want\"\"to show you just like\"\"the process before applying this\"\"sunscreen\"\"so that you can see that this is a\"\"genuine review and\"\"we are starting on a clean slate so when\"\"i'm done i just pat my face\"\"and i do not grab my face as i always\"\"say so i just pat my face\"\"dry and then go in with any serums that\"\"i'll be going in with usually my morning\"\"skin care routine you guys is\"\"very very simple so when i'm done doing\"\"that i like to go in with the serums of\"\"the day my morning serums\"\"and just pat it on my face so that i can\"\"go\"\"in with my biodemo of course you guys i\"\"apply\"\"the moisturizer before this then go in\"\"with\"\"this sunscreen so it has been a month\"\"since i've been using this for sunscreen\"\"and i have a lot to say and this retails\"\"for . i got it from a discount\"\"and as you guys can see this is how it\"\"looks this is how golden looks like what\"\"kind of golden is the please make it\"\"make sense\"\"how is this golden color maybe you guys\"\"i'm just tripping but anyways that is\"\"how our golden color is looking\"\"i don't know on which skin or maybe in\"\"what skin\"\"i have no idea guys but anyways we're\"\"working with that color\"\"and it's just like a sneak peek just to\"\"show you guys anyways i just wanted to\"\"show you that i'm dressed so\"\"i'm not naked y'all this is how my face\"\"is looking before i apply\"\"the sunscreen now i'm gonna apply this\"\"in three ways because i actually like\"\"tried to work around the sunscreen\"\"because already we can tell that\"\"this is not gonna be matching my skin at\"\"all so this is the normal way in which i\"\"would apply my normal sunscreen that\"\"doesn't\"\"have any tint to it just to say guys\"\"this is a chemical sunscreen so\"\"it is not a mineral sunscreen sometimes\"\"i would expect mineral sunscreens to\"\"give us\"\"white colors but anyways we're still in\"\"um i don't know campaign to actually\"\"bag companies to give us products that\"\"are gonna match our skin\"\"i don't know at all if it's in it's just\"\"difficult to make something that is\"\"going to match\"\"our skin colors or just this chemical\"\"filters\"\"j they're just white or we can't have\"\"any filters that are going to match our\"\"face\"\"i don't know you guys but anyways i work\"\"that sunscreen into my skin and yeah it\"\"is cool right anyways\"\"let's blend it um golden color into your\"\"skin baby your skin is golden your skin\"\"is\"\"gold so you need to match your skin so\"\"anyways i waited for  minutes because\"\"usually with my sunscreen\"\"i'd like to apply  minutes before if\"\"i'm not late you guys because sometimes\"\"i tend to bleed but anyways\"\"this is how we're looking on the sun wow\"\"y'all this\"\"is beautiful isn't it\"\"so this is the second take so i figured\"\"that that won't work so let me try to\"\"apply this\"\"on my palm rub it on my palm and apply\"\"on my skin and see how this is going to\"\"work and as you guys can see i'm just\"\"using the same amount that\"\"i normally use on my sunscreen that\"\"doesn't give me any white cast and you\"\"guys i\"\"am not slapping myself way too hard i am\"\"just trying to make sure that it is in\"\"my skin like it's it's\"\"it's just like penetrating into my skin\"\"one thing i'll say you guys this product\"\"doesn't go\"\"it doesn't penetrate my skin real quick\"\"and yeah if you've got sensitive skin\"\"this will make you rub your skin because\"\"you need to work it in as you guys can\"\"see it it honestly looks a little bit\"\"better\"\"when i use that method of putting in i\"\"then waited again for  minutes to see\"\"if it will absorb to my skin\"\"and i tried you guys it's not the best\"\"but it did try so\"\"when you put it in you rub it on your\"\"palm and try to work it in it is a\"\"little bit\"\"better you do see a little bit of that\"\"white cast but you just need to put a\"\"little bit of work\"\"i hate putting a lot of work more\"\"especially in the morning we are late we\"\"are busy okay\"\"so i washed my face applied the\"\"moisturizer and\"\"the trick yeah this is the trick you\"\"need to apply your moisturizer\"\"and then real quick go in with that\"\"bioderma sunscreen\"\"and rub it on your palm and you are\"\"going to work in layers if you work in\"\"layers\"\"you are not going to go wrong now the\"\"problem is you are going to rub your\"\"skin way more and it is not good for\"\"those who have sensitive skin\"\"i feel like it would work very well if\"\"you've got them like fair\"\"very fair skin because this will just\"\"blend into your skin but you've got some\"\"melanin if you're rich in melanin i\"\"don't know you just need to\"\"like make it work okay like you have to\"\"work it in less as i'm doing here so i\"\"work in layers and you know apply\"\"another layer and\"\"wait apply another layer and wait and\"\"this was actually going in smoothly so\"\"it doesn't work well when you apply a\"\"lot at the same time\"\"so you just need to make sure you\"\"prepare yourself\"\"early before you actually go out because\"\"you're gonna need a lot of\"\"layers and patting in and if your skin\"\"becomes\"\"too sensitive through rubbing then it's\"\"a problem now i'm gonna give it to this\"\"sunscreen\"\"um it doesn't bend or stink it doesn't\"\"even break me out at\"\"all and it just it feels good on skin\"\"it does give a little bit of\"\"moisturizing effect and again if you've\"\"got oily skin it tends to be oilier\"\"um greasy sort of during the day so i\"\"feel like it is also friendly for those\"\"who have got\"\"dry skin um i know if\"\"you have like oily skin and sometimes\"\"you need\"\"like products that are not going to be\"\"you know super oily so yeah take that\"\"so these are the pros it's moisturizing\"\"it doesn't give me any breakout\"\"now um the cons you guys white casts\"\"it doesn't really go in smoothly it just\"\"takes time to absorb\"\"[music]\"\"one thing that i'll also say you guys is\"\"that this sunscreen doesn't really work\"\"well\"\"with other serums so you need to just\"\"check\"\"which serums your morning serums this\"\"will\"\"not roll more especially when you are\"\"using the first and second method\"\"it is going to roll so i find it work a\"\"little bit better with\"\"the moisturizer now that is it you guys\"\"from me the golden lady and thank you so\"\"much you guys for watching please don't\"\"forget subscribe to like and comment\"\"and i'll see you guys on the next one\"\"bye\"\"my name is ramone cosmetic formulator\"\"aesthetician uk resident and along with\"\"that means i have access to some really\"\"good quality sunscreens and that was one\"\"of the things that i was so excited for\"\"when i was first moving here if you guys\"\"haven't seen already i do have one video\"\"up on a review of a handful of some\"\"european sunscreens i got here at boots\"\"well we're back to do a round two i have\"\"a few different options in front of me i\"\"have nevaeh or nivea i don't care how to\"\"pronounce it if y'all call me in the\"\"comments that is on you bioderma and\"\"vichy today before i get into the video\"\"do you want to say stay tuned hit the\"\"subscribe button notification bell i\"\"have an entire bag full of european\"\"sunscreens i have yet to review i bought\"\"pretty much the entire lineup of user\"\"and sunscreens i also have a video\"\"coming up soon featuring easton freezie\"\"derm and heliocare so hit the\"\"notification bell to know when those\"\"videos go live as well so let's get into\"\"the sunscreens i'll put a card up here\"\"about some other videos where i feature\"\"some other european sunscreens but i am\"\"no stranger to these i've been using\"\"these now for well over six months for\"\"all let me see i use my handy little\"\"quarter teaspoon to measure out the\"\"quantity i do a full quarter teaspoon\"\"generally for face ears and neck but for\"\"the video since this is face application\"\"i do half of this which is an eighth\"\"teaspoon i'll work that in let it sit\"\"for a few minutes so you can see the\"\"final finish and the look of it on the\"\"skin as well as if there's any white\"\"cast so getting started first one we\"\"have is from nivea this is their nivea\"\"sun eevee face shine control this i\"\"bought a long time ago and actually got\"\"confused because i ended up buying two\"\"of these because one of them on the box\"\"just said shine control and the other on\"\"the box said mattifying effect and i\"\"thought they were separate things\"\"they're not same thing this is from\"\"nivea these cost six pounds they cost\"\"costed they cost six pounds when i first\"\"bought them although now they are eight\"\"pound up boots but the magic of boots is\"\"a lot of times they have sales this is\"\"an spf  and it does have the uva\"\"circled on it they do designate this as\"\"high uva uvb protection on the back of\"\"this it does have four star uva\"\"protection in the bootstar system some\"\"marketing details nivea sun uv face\"\"shine control offers sun protection\"\"specifically designed for facial needs\"\"light formula offers long lasting and\"\"instant mattifying effects you will note\"\"that the cream absorbs excess oils from\"\"your skin's surface and you'll be\"\"protected from uv and high energy\"\"visible lights which can cause premature\"\"aging your skin will feel light\"\"non-greasy non-sticky it is eye friendly\"\"and ophthalmologically proven as well\"\"worth noting compared to the other ones\"\"in the video this one is not water\"\"resistant formula details uv filter wise\"\"stable benzone for uva octa satellite\"\"for uvb tenosurp s broad spectrum\"\"insulazole for more uvb and then even\"\"lt for qb as well this does have\"\"alcohol fragrance and essential oils in\"\"there and so it's really interesting\"\"when they're like oh it's sensitive skin\"\"friendly but it does have those\"\"components and also the eye irritancy\"\"one is interesting as well because i\"\"mean like how do you test that i know\"\"how it's tested but realistically how\"\"that's a very general statement to make\"\"considering how subjective skin feel and\"\"overall experience can be with something\"\"like this does have a couple things like\"\"tapioca starch and silica which aid in\"\"some of the mattifying oil absorbing\"\"benefits to it but then it also has this\"\"specific licorice based extract and in\"\"the marketing for it does say that this\"\"does offer high energy visible light\"\"protection this specific licorice\"\"extract in this is the same exact one in\"\"my holy grail eucerin sunscreen but\"\"aside from that tocopherol acetate for\"\"vitamin e antioxidant benefits and\"\"that's kind of the extent of formulation\"\"stand out my experience with this you\"\"can see with the application the texture\"\"for this is like a little bit creamy\"\"it's got a little bit more body it's not\"\"a true gel which i mean for the sake of\"\"comparison the used saran that i talked\"\"about that is one of my favorites very\"\"gel texture this gel creams a little bit\"\"more body to it and i just mentioned\"\"there's a little bit more of an\"\"emollient component to the formulation\"\"of this it leaves a semi-radiant finish\"\"and it looks like it's going on like a\"\"moisturizer this is one of those\"\"products that i use straight after\"\"rinsing as a one and done product this\"\"is my moisturizer my sunscreen has a\"\"little bit something extra in there as\"\"well but i don't put much underneath\"\"this because the texture of this is a\"\"little bit more moisturizing you can see\"\"as it sets down to me it just leaves a\"\"natural glow to the skin i don't think\"\"it's it's not very greasy it's not very\"\"heavy but it is a moisturizing finish\"\"what's interesting is the mattifying the\"\"shine control that to me is a bit of a\"\"stretch this to me is not modifying in\"\"the slightest but it is very oily skin\"\"compatible the way i see it is it kind\"\"of leaves a natural glow on your face\"\"and basically controls your oils from\"\"making you look any more shiny but you\"\"do have a natural like radiance to you\"\"that gives your skin some life you're\"\"not flat matte dead but this is arguably\"\"i think my favorite in this entire video\"\"and i do use this very regularly because\"\"it's very convenient for me especially\"\"on days when i need a little bit more\"\"moisturization next up on the list this\"\"is one i think i had a lot of comments\"\"when i went to the first european\"\"sunscreen video being like try bioderma\"\"try bioderma so i got a couple from them\"\"this is the bioderma photoderm max spf\"\" plus aqua fluid no this is the yellow\"\"tube this is spf  plus and this one\"\"has no tint apparently they offer a\"\"light tint and then a gold tint for this\"\"one i don't know what that gold means i\"\"don't know if it means that it's like my\"\"complexion or darker but this does also\"\"come in tinted versions i just have the\"\"regular non-tinted one this was  pound\"\"this offers high eva evb and t shine\"\"protection i found on a separate\"\"retailer site because this is no longer\"\"on boots website don't know why this had\"\"a uva pf specifically of  and i'm only\"\"noting that because uva\"\"circled anywhere on this i don't believe\"\"and also it doesn't give me a boot star\"\"rating either marketing points pleasant\"\"and easy application thanks to a fluid\"\"texture as light as water dry touch\"\"finish ideal for all skin types even\"\"combination to oily sensitive skin or\"\"intolerant to all types of sunlight very\"\"fair skin with freckles and exposed skin\"\"to maximum sunlight those are all the\"\"skin types and conditions that this is\"\"acceptable for oil-free formula\"\"non-greasy texture good skin tolerance\"\"non-comedogenic unfragranced water\"\"resistant and then main marketing points\"\"behind bowdermist sunscreens is they\"\"have a cellular bioprotection trademark\"\"patent and that is essentially some sort\"\"of like antioxidant situation that they\"\"say boost the overall sun efficacy and\"\"that is some sort of like bioderma\"\"proprietary patent on a specific\"\"formulation component that boosts sun\"\"protection factor of your skin and\"\"aiding with the sunscreen it's the\"\"marketing for it was really weird but on\"\"top of that this also has a synergistic\"\"combination of three powders that give a\"\"mattifying dry touch finish filters in\"\"this this features octokrylan which is\"\"dvb into some of the longer wavelength\"\"uva tinasorb m which is a hybrid filter\"\"it is a chemical filter by composition\"\"but it's an insoluble particle so it's a\"\"solid particle that's suspended in the\"\"formulation so it acts a little bit more\"\"like a mineral filter you have able\"\"benzone which is uva  and uva  and\"\"then latinos or m i believe is broad\"\"spectrum and then tinos orb s which is\"\"broad spectrum as well so really good\"\"broad spectrum protection and then bumps\"\"up on either end as well this is alcohol\"\"fragrance and essential oil free which\"\"is worth noting because they do make\"\"cleanse this is like great for sensitive\"\"skin or very compromised skin and then\"\"you have the things that help with water\"\"resistance the mattifiers this does have\"\"more emollience in the formulation i\"\"think experience for this you can see as\"\"i'm depositing it into the teaspoon this\"\"is liquidy and if i could just boil this\"\"down to one statement this is like the\"\"sister the wannabe sister of the la\"\"roche posay and thalios choco fluid\"\"sunscreen very similar texture and it\"\"feels like it wants to be the same\"\"product there's a lot of things that\"\"they're not the same first and foremost\"\"talking about the uv protection minds\"\"you spf  plus no uva circled on this\"\"that i could find i also did throw away\"\"the box though so if you got the box and\"\"it circled on there comment that down\"\"below but there's also no boot star\"\"rating on this either and i did find a\"\"uva pf rating of  which if you're\"\"using like the ppd system like the pa\"\"pluses that you see on korean sunscreens\"\"this would be a pa  plus technically\"\"and regardless that is a great daily\"\"sunscreen situation the other part of\"\"this is the fact that it says it's\"\"supposed to be matte with powder dry\"\"touch finish if you look on the screen i\"\"feel like i look i have a gloss to me\"\"it's not greasy but it's like i look\"\"shiny and i don't understand that and i\"\"don't like the way this looks on my skin\"\"if i'm going to be honest part of that\"\"reason is because after a little bit i\"\"feel like my skin looks dry but oily if\"\"that makes any sense but also this has\"\"that tenosurp m component and i\"\"mentioned it basically functions like a\"\"mineral sunscreen it makes this cling to\"\"my facial hair so it looks like i\"\"essentially have a dusting of like white\"\"setting powder all over my mustache my\"\"eyebrows my hairline and my beard so\"\"this is one thing i like to wear under\"\"makeup because i think it does prep the\"\"skin nicely for makeup i just don't like\"\"it by itself and also the other part of\"\"it is it does this thing on like my\"\"under eyes where it gives them like a\"\"great cast next up though from bioderma\"\"again this is their photoderm akn mats\"\"notice this is a white bottle and this\"\"is spf . for this one uva is circled\"\"but again no designation on bootstars\"\"for this marketing for this a bioderma\"\"innovation the exclusive fluid active\"\"trademark patent in photoderm akn matte\"\"biologically regulates sebum quality to\"\"keep pores from becoming clogged and\"\"prevent the appearance of blemishes\"\"which is often exacerbated after periods\"\"of sun exposure photogram akn matte\"\"offers real internal biological\"\"protection again that cellular\"\"bioprotection pen and then it also says\"\"this exclusive patent preserves and\"\"stimulates the skin's defenses during\"\"sun exposure so basically long lasting\"\"matte claims non-greasy finish no white\"\"cast they want to emphasize this one\"\"does have a sense to it and it's also\"\"waterproof so talking about some of the\"\"claims that fluid active was interesting\"\"because this one is matte i mean it's in\"\"the name matte this one specifically\"\"talks about a patent to regulate sebum\"\"and keep the skin matte that the other\"\"photoderm didn't have the patented\"\"complex fights against sebum thickening\"\"in order to keep portion becoming\"\"clogged and to minimize the risk of\"\"blemishes appearing which is interesting\"\"so this features salicylic and glycolic\"\"acid i don't think i've ever seen\"\"glycolic acid in the sunscreen period\"\"and i don't think i've ever seen\"\"salicylic acid any sunscreen either\"\"those are exfoliants which is fun i like\"\"that again one and done products who\"\"just love that get your exfoliation and\"\"your sun protection all in one go but i\"\"think those are partly responsible for\"\"that seven regulating benefit salicylic\"\"acid as well as the component of\"\"preventing the pores from becoming\"\"clogged then you also have tocopherol\"\"and tocopheroacetate so both forms of\"\"vitamin e then you have ectoin and\"\"propyl gallate which are antioxidants\"\"you also have ginkgo biloba extract\"\"which always reminds me of fenty skin\"\"love her and then golden kelp which is a\"\"kelp extract and kind of aids in water\"\"binding so it's like humectant benefits\"\"but can also potentially have some skin\"\"soothing benefits or antioxidant\"\"benefits as well filters this has\"\"octopriline so uvb uva tinosorb m once\"\"again so that's that broad spectrum\"\"hybrid filter and then evobenzone for\"\"uva protection less filters but\"\"interesting assortment again this is\"\"only spf  which is perfectly adequate\"\"great daily protection or if you don't\"\"necessarily need the high high high\"\"factor because again this is water\"\"resistant so it's great for daily on the\"\"go or just like minimal sun exposure\"\"where for example you might sweat a lot\"\"but again it's interesting again i point\"\"out this is spf  does have that uva\"\"circle could not find a uva pf rating\"\"for this but the other bio dimmer\"\"doesn't have that why is that but as you\"\"see with the application similar body\"\"similar texture it's very watery\"\"lightweight it is giving that la roche\"\"posay and thalios fluid this goes on\"\"nicely though i think i have a\"\"preference for this specific one over\"\"the other bioderma what i will say is\"\"that i also definitely like to\"\"moisturize well underneath this this in\"\"itself does have some emollients and\"\"body to it but the mattifying effect of\"\"this on non-moisturized skin can get\"\"very unpleasant very quick so it'll be\"\"moisturized very well i think this is\"\"beautiful for oily skin i wouldn't\"\"recommend these for dry skin i'm gonna\"\"be honest just for that finish and\"\"texture issue and for either of these if\"\"you have deep skin i would not count on\"\"these just because of the teenage sort\"\"of m elements and then last sunscreen\"\"this is the vichy ideal soleil\"\"mattifying face dry touch sun cream so i\"\"was very excited to try some vichy\"\"options vichy to me it's like a very\"\"french pharmacy and i don't know why\"\"because i think technically bioderma is\"\"too but vichy's like the pinnacle of\"\"like french pharmacy to me so i was very\"\"excited to try this out this is  pound\"\" for ml the marketing behind this is\"\"idiosola modifying face dry touch spf \"\"helps protect the skin against the\"\"harmful effects of sun into uv has soft\"\"dry touch zero shine water resistant\"\"finish they do say suitable for\"\"combination and sensitive skin and then\"\"it's enriched with vichy mineralizing\"\"thermal water again this is spf  this\"\"does have a uva plus circled there is no\"\"uva pf indicated on this either but i do\"\"trust that this has good protection this\"\"formula includes a white spectrum filter\"\"system and photostable uva ebv based\"\"mixorals mixorals are l'oreal patented\"\"filters vichy is a l'oreal sub brand and\"\"then that vichy mineral water so a lot\"\"of brands like lourish jose vichy really\"\"center around this thermal water\"\"situation and we should explain it like\"\"this vichy mineral water strengthens the\"\"natural defenses of the skin the\"\"volcanic water of vichy was born from\"\"the volcanoes of ovarn rich in \"\"essential minerals so essentially it's\"\"like water that's volcanic water\"\"enriched with minerals that can really\"\"aid in the skin barrier function and\"\"moisturization and blah blah blah so\"\"filter wise you have homosalates\"\"octosale evinol t tinosorp s mixoral\"\"xl avobenzone octocrylene mixoryl sx and\"\"nanotitanium dioxide so you got a whole\"\"salad up in there of uv filters\"\"primarily these are all chemical filters\"\"we do see that nano titanium dioxide\"\"always a concern anytime you see a\"\"mineral or mineral adjacent filter but\"\"it's nano so that hopefully will aid in\"\"a little bit more elegance per se but\"\"aside from that this is alcohol free but\"\"this is fragrance and this is fragranced\"\"underlying exclamation points this is\"\"perfumey it's giving macy's fragrance\"\"counter the fragrance on this one is\"\"strong and if you have compromised skin\"\"i'm gonna be honest my eye areas right\"\"now very compromised they were on fire\"\"when i put this on so i don't know why\"\"this is compatible with sensitive skin\"\"because i disagree that's just me and\"\"then there's a couple botanical based\"\"extracts for example there's a cinnamon\"\"botanical extract in this which i looked\"\"into what it could potentially do skin\"\"wise and it has potentially a steady\"\"sauce some potential and anti-terrorism\"\"and antioxidant benefits which basically\"\"means it can kind of help with pigment\"\"fading benefits and also some\"\"antioxidant protection the big one for\"\"this one though is that it's mattifying\"\"it's mattifying dry touch i agree with\"\"those claims but i didn't find it was a\"\"very elegant experience you can see i\"\"put it on this is more of a gel\"\"situation so it's very reminiscent of\"\"the eucerin it's not as moisturizing\"\"though it doesn't have that annoyance\"\"that the nivea one kind of does this one\"\"definitely does have this dry down like\"\"dry touch effect that fragrance is so\"\"strong it does linger for like at least\"\"half an hour afterwards maybe a little\"\"bit more and that's definitely just the\"\"biggest thing this does have that\"\"fragrance to it texture wise this does\"\"wear really nice under makeup i find it\"\"does prep the skin well i'm wearing it\"\"under my face right now if you\"\"moisturize well underneath this you\"\"don't have any issues with it cleaning\"\"to texture or any dry patches on the\"\"skin but you do have to moisturize even\"\"having oily skin use a gel moisturizer\"\"but you will have to pipe your skin\"\"adequately for this and you can't see it\"\"right now but when i look in the mirror\"\"i see it i just have like a coating a\"\"dusting of whites on my facial hair my\"\"mustache and everything in my eyebrows\"\"because of this and i'm going to\"\"attribute that more to the titanium\"\"dioxide in this so it's not really\"\"elegant in dark hair dark facial hair or\"\"whatnot so that's another big con if you\"\"apply this in the right way this is very\"\"nice it's very workable but you will\"\"have to tolerate that fragrance so with\"\"that that is round two of european\"\"chemist pharmacy sunscreens this was a\"\"toss up really some of these are not\"\"that great or they're like a very\"\"mid-tier there's like things i could do\"\"to like bump them up but they're just\"\"they're not great the nevaeh one i think\"\"is my favorite out of all these and i do\"\"reach for it pretty substantially let me\"\"know down below in the comments section\"\"what other boots related or european\"\"chemist sunscreens do you want to see me\"\"review on the channel don't forget to\"\"hit the subscribe button notification\"\"bell so that you know when i post more\"\"skincare sunscreen and fancy rated\"\"content on my channel give it a thumbs\"\"up and thanks for watching guys bye\"\"[music]\"\"you\"\"hi today i'm reviewing the bioderma\"\"photo durm aqua fluid spf and really\"\"quick i just want to say purchase eye\"\"products with my own money\"\"i'll never waste your time with\"\"sponsored ads or videos so if you want\"\"to help support the channel check out no\"\"bs beauty comm check out my patreon\"\"community or click on the amazon link\"\"below okay so these were this is another\"\"sunscreen i picked up at look\"\"fantasticks uk page they should be\"\"paying me like a referral fee because\"\"i'm advertising for them a lot anyway\"\"that's where i picked up most of the\"\"european type sunscreens where is in the\"\"us it's difficult to get them because\"\"the fda is about  years behind on\"\"sunscreen approvals literally i think\"\"it's like been since  since they\"\"approved any new filters something like\"\"that something crazy so anyway there's\"\"some ways around it i like to find the\"\"way around it because you know if you\"\"live in the us and you're using a\"\"typical chemical sunscreen you're not\"\"really getting great uva coverage and\"\"uva rays are once that cause wrinkles\"\"and fine lines and skin damage so keep\"\"that in mind most americans probably\"\"would age so much better if they had\"\"access to european sunscreens but most\"\"i'm probably a lot of them probably\"\"don't even know what they're missing\"\"until you've tried them and not at least\"\"i didn't so anyway bioderma calls this a\"\"very high sun protection with a fluid\"\"texture as light as water with a dry\"\"touch finish suitable for all skin types\"\"even combination to oily skin skin that\"\"is sensitive to are intolerant to all\"\"types of sunlight very fair-skinned with\"\"freckles and skin that as a pole exposed\"\"to maximum sunlight or anybody that\"\"really just wants to prevent aging okay\"\"so let me get to my first criteria which\"\"is packaging and i like the packaging\"\"nice squeeze to bottle although it does\"\"have a tendency to be very goopy when\"\"you open it up and it's got kind of a\"\"needle nose tip on it so just keep that\"\"in mind once you start once you dump it\"\"over it'll start leaking out and i'll\"\"apply it in a second so okay no issues\"\"with that\"\"in terms of denatured or drying types of\"\"alcohol this does not have any of those\"\"so that's always a good thing even\"\"though it's got a nice liquid texture no\"\"drain alcohols does contain some fatty\"\"alcohols such as sea - which are a\"\"good type of alcohol a few of you\"\"mention the crave beauty beat the beat\"\"the sunscreen beat the sun sunscreen\"\"which i reviewed a few days ago and\"\"really liked a lot of the\"\"characteristics of it but we're not so\"\"excited that alcohol is higher up on the\"\"ingredient list in my opinion this is a\"\"good alternative to that it's got all of\"\"the good characteristics of it without\"\"the alcohol so i mentioned that as\"\"something worth checking out if you were\"\"a very sensitive skin or a bit nervous\"\"about that\"\"so something worth considering terms of\"\"fragrance this does not have any\"\"fragrance in it which is great and no\"\"scent at all it doesn't even have the\"\"chemical sunscreen smell which most or a\"\"lot of chemical sunscreens have so this\"\"one's awesome because there's literally\"\"no scent to it so very great for\"\"sensitive skin in terms of the\"\"manufacturing location this one is made\"\"in france so no issues at all with that\"\"spf coverage which is uvb coverage is\"\"-plus so that means it's great i\"\"recommend at least  everyday and  is\"\"great especially if you wear a\"\"foundation over your sunscreen the more\"\"layers you apply over sunscreen the more\"\"diluted the coverage potentially can be\"\"i saw on a chart the other day it was a\"\"sunscreen product the chart had the list\"\"of order of ingredients or what you use\"\"so you cleanse you tone serum sunscreen\"\"primer then foundation and i thought you\"\"know what i always apply my primer\"\"before the sunscreen just because any\"\"layer you put over it has a potential to\"\"kind of decrease the amount of\"\"protection you're getting so something\"\"worth considering i always play my\"\"primer before hand although it kind of\"\"sometimes defeats a bit of the point of\"\"primer so even just foundation could\"\"kind of dilute it a little bit so i\"\"that's why i think in my opinion thirty\"\"is the least but fifty is good\"\"especially if you're gonna play\"\"foundation or makeup over it it's just\"\"you're getting much better protection\"\"although one thing to keep in mind the\"\"amok you go over thirty you're not\"\"getting you're not getting twenty more\"\"than third it kind of decreases a little\"\"bit the higher up you go but it's still\"\"stronger and better so okay terms of the\"\"uva protection factor this one has a ppd\"\"of twenty four which is something i\"\"would wanted to remember to mention it\"\"more often which is persistent pigment\"\"darkening so sixteen and up on that\"\"scale qualifies as adequate protection\"\"the higher up the number the better some\"\"sunscreens have demonstrated a ppd of \"\"or higher so that's very good coverage\"\"so this one's twenty four so that's\"\"pretty good up there pretty good up\"\"there pretty good pretty high up there\"\"so i have no issues with that it's\"\"probably much better than the average us\"\"sunscreen okay then in terms of the\"\"filters used in this we've got evo ben\"\"zone which is a uv avery absorber which\"\"is typically unstable but it can be\"\"helped with the use of other filters in\"\"it which can help it be a bit more\"\"stable although avo ben zone on its own\"\"for just uva rays is probably what most\"\"us sunscreens have and it's not not good\"\"enough in my opinion so then we've got\"\"octo cry lean which is a uvb absorber\"\"and it also has the ability to absorb\"\"some short uva rays i'm sorry if you can\"\"hear my dogs barking i know someone must\"\"be walking up and down the street or\"\"there's a squirrel in the yard so i'm\"\"sure you can hear it i'm sorry okay\"\"then we've got methylene\"\"you know there must be like a turkey in\"\"the yard or something\"\"okay then i've got methylene biz benza\"\"trion tetramethyl beautiful which is\"\"also known as vis acht result which is a\"\"broad-spectrum uva and uvb ray absorber\"\"it also has some ability to reflect and\"\"scatter uv light so it's a great filter\"\"then we've got tin syrup s which is a\"\"uva and uvb ray absorber also very photo\"\"stable so we've got a good variety of\"\"filters for both uva and uvb rays so i\"\"have no issues with that then we get\"\"into the white cast and i will apply it\"\"and this one really doesn't have a white\"\"cast see how liquidy it comes out man\"\"the dogs are just going crazy okay so\"\"after you apply it it does take a minute\"\"to really soak it in but for the most\"\"part there's not much of a white cast\"\"initially it looks like you're gonna\"\"have a white cast and maybe it has a\"\"very mild white cast but for the most\"\"part in my opinion this is one of the\"\"better sunscreens in terms of white\"\"casts because there isn't much once it\"\"absorbs really sets to a nice matte\"\"finish with not much minimal white cast\"\"if anything and there you go so i in my\"\"opinion you can't really see a white\"\"cast so and after it's so give after you\"\"give it a couple minutes to soak in it\"\"really has no light cast lincoln honey\"\"what trouble are you causing those tails\"\"are just out of control\"\"notty okay so i'll do a ph test just for\"\"you guys and gals i love the ph so\"\"i would say it's a ph of about five ish\"\"maybe five and a half maybe so no issues\"\"with that one okay in terms of texture\"\"obviously it's a very goopy liquidy\"\"texture which isn't always the easiest\"\"to work with because it is so liquidy\"\"although i guess in the title aqua fluid\"\"i guess you get that although what i\"\"like about it is after it's soaked in\"\"after you've given a few minutes to soak\"\"in it really scents to a nice matte non\"\"sticky finish which is a big deal for a\"\"lot of people so after you give it a\"\"minute or two to soak in it's really not\"\"sticking doesn't transfer a ton so\"\"that's always a nice factor as well so\"\"no issues with the texture although i\"\"guess it says it's fluid ease of use so\"\"smooths over skin very easily slightly\"\"hydrating works well over most\"\"moisturizers and primers i could give a\"\"minute to absorb sets to a nice\"\"invisible finish a great option for\"\"those that don't wear foundation or even\"\"if you do our foundation good option for\"\"that too but i know a lot of people that\"\"don't wear foundation really like\"\"something that sets to a nice matte\"\"finish with no noticeable white cast so\"\"there we go\"\"and now that it's absorbed it's not\"\"sticky at all so very nice okay then in\"\"terms of antioxidants and beneficial\"\"ingredients this one contains a lot of\"\"slip and basic hydrating ingredients not\"\"a ton of real beneficial ingredients or\"\"antioxidants which is kind of in my\"\"opinion the major downside with this one\"\"is there's really not a ton of great\"\"stuff it's got vitamin e which is great\"\"xylitol and mannitol which are both\"\"humectants and that's about it for\"\"really exciting beneficial ingredients\"\"so if you're gonna use this one i really\"\"recommend applying over a really good\"\"vitamin c serum or another great\"\"hydrating serum or moisturizer so\"\"that's got some good things for your\"\"skin so your skin isn't just totally\"\"relying on this to do it all because it\"\"really it can it can block the rays but\"\"it can't help really hydrate skin or\"\"anything else for that matter so keep\"\"that one in mind that in terms of acne\"\"genic ingredients does have a few acne\"\"triggers so we've got glyceryl stearate\"\"citrate which is a fungal acne trigger\"\"and then vitamin e which is can be very\"\"acne genic for some people so that's\"\"about it so pretty friendly for acne\"\"prone skin with the exception of the\"\"vitamin e then we've got animal testing\"\"and unfortunately bioderma is not\"\"cruelty free which surprised me because\"\"for some reason i guess it's been a\"\"while since i reviewed anything for\"\"bioderma but they are sold in mainland\"\"china so they're not cruelty free then\"\"in terms of performance i'm really happy\"\"with it lasts nicely on skin without\"\"breaking up foundation or becoming oily\"\"or greasy feeling throughout the day\"\"partially water resistant as well great\"\"for sensitive skin especially with the\"\"fact that has no alcohol and no\"\"fragrance performs above average it\"\"exceeded my expectations in my opinion\"\"so it's quite happy with it it does take\"\"a little bit of finesse to remove at the\"\"end of the day the more water resistant\"\"the sunscreen is the trickier i find\"\"them to be to remove they just require a\"\"bit more effort so if you use this one\"\"might be wise to do a two step cleanse\"\"so oil based cleanser first and then a\"\"soapy cleanser after that just to make\"\"sure you move it all because you\"\"certainly don't want to go to bed with\"\"any traces of sunscreen on your skin\"\"just for so many reasons especially acne\"\"and things like that okay then in terms\"\"of the price so this is the full size\"\"which is . ounces which is the\"\"equivalent of  milliliters and retails\"\"for about  dollars wherever your look\"\"so that averages out to about  cents\"\"per milliliter which is in the very\"\"affordable ring\"\"it's not the cheapest sunscreen i've\"\"reviewed but it's also not the most\"\"expensive so that's a nice factor so on\"\"the saris car scale with  being\"\"perfect this one is guarded  so pretty\"\"good couple things i might mess with on\"\"it maybe not but overall it's still\"\"pretty pretty darn good option so anyway\"\"i'm interested in hearing from you guys\"\"if you've had a chance to try this i\"\"think there's another bioderma product\"\"coming up that i'll be reviewing this\"\"week as well so be sure to stay tuned\"\"for that one so anyway i love hearing\"\"from you guys so leave your comments and\"\"i will see you more tomorrow thank you\"\"so much guys\"\"well hey guys it is saturday it's the\"\"weekend before a new year's eve new\"\"year's day so yeah you're watching this\"\"the weekend after more than likely but\"\"this morning i cracked into a new\"\"sunscreen and i finished up the one that\"\"i was using before from europe and i\"\"cracked into you this morning i cracked\"\"into the via derma photo jar max i think\"\"it's called spf  plus also from europe\"\"that one of you all sent me i really\"\"like it it's very liquidy so you know\"\"it's it it's fragrance free as as all of\"\"the european sunscreens it's got uva\"\"filters that are a little bit more photo\"\"stable than those we have here in the us\"\"and i blend it in really nicely to the\"\"skin no white cast moisturizing that\"\"there wasn't like any alcohol leanness\"\"to it\"\"i think oily skin types would like it\"\"yeah but anyways i'm headed over to my\"\"mom's house we're gonna have some lunch\"\"get cracking on our planners it's kind\"\"of a gloomy day and it's been raining so\"\"the allergens are high that it's what\"\"it's going on hope everybody is having a\"\"fantastic new year and sailing right\"\"along as you saw this morning my\"\"christmas tree is still up all pokey on\"\"getting not downers then ocupado but\"\"lately a lot of things so that is on my\"\"to-do list for this upcoming week as to\"\"a sadly take down my tree joe down some\"\"of my deck or on my kitchen counter but\"\"and that's so sad for me because\"\"honestly christmas is like the only\"\"thing i really get into we dig forward\"\"for and even that's pretty minimal now\"\"it's like anyways i'm here so i'll check\"\"me good well hey guys i just made it to\"\"my mom's house and um looks like she is\"\"picking down a christmas decor as well\"\"slowly but surely in a piecemeal fashion\"\"that movie\"\"the village is bare my mom has taken the\"\"village down but um i'm just making a\"\"tea for myself here with the nutcracker\"\"mug before he gets put away and i'm\"\"gonna try this christmas morning black\"\"and green tea bites - you guys\"\"recommended these teas and this one\"\"looks like a good one so we'll give it a\"\"try here and see how it goes\"\"yeah they were out of the stello at the\"\"grocery store um last time that i want\"\"to repurchase it and i tried the jabalia\"\"have you guys ever had jabalia so it's\"\"pretty good i've been drinking that um\"\"and it's a little milder than the\"\"vostell oo but it's a good one i also\"\"like lavazza\"\"a lot but for whatever reason lavazza\"\"sells out really fast and i have a\"\"difficult time sourcing it and you\"\"already had lunch i'm gonna move so i'm\"\"just about to make my own cauliflower\"\"oats um i have a recipe for this close\"\"to down below but i'm gonna use and the\"\"timer's just going off but my mom has um\"\"some frozen rice cauliflower here you\"\"got this at costco yeah is that what we\"\"had on not christmas day it's really\"\"good um\"\"it is the maas river organic rice\"\"cauliflower and it comes in these little\"\"pouches and i guess you could put this\"\"in the microwave\"\"oh wait for five minutes the first three\"\"minutes then you rub you flip it over\"\"you don't flip it over what you rotate\"\"it yeah yeah i'm doing the microwave\"\"it's easier\"\"well no i'm gonna do it on the stove but\"\"so the christmas morning black tea i\"\"have to say tastes just like you mean\"\"ordinary black tea i don't really taste\"\"either the green tea component or\"\"anything particularly christmasy about\"\"it um so if you like black tea you might\"\"like that one but i have to say i have\"\"had this christmas in paris this is a\"\"nighttime caffeine free one and this one\"\"is really good it's kind of got a\"\"chocolatey taste to it\"\"subtly so this is probably one of my\"\"favorites that i've had from stash so\"\"far what did you think of christmas in\"\"paris did you like it\"\"no the nighttime line yeah so i've just\"\"got my colleague rice cauliflower\"\"cooking up here and i'm going to add a\"\"third of a cup of these are rolled oats\"\"just from quaker oatmeal\"\"and i'm gonna let that cook on here and\"\"then i'm gonna add half a serving of the\"\"chocolate organic protein so this is the\"\"candle that i mentioned in my lifestyle\"\"favorites video the tuscany candle um i\"\"think i called it balsam fir i haven't\"\"tried this one but you guys know i love\"\"the tuscany candle companies but it's\"\"actually called first snow that my mom\"\"has and she doesn't have it lit\"\"currently five he's got you lit it this\"\"morning yeah that's the wax not going\"\"and you can\"\"smell it's really nice yeah it really\"\"does it smells like like we're narnia in\"\"here it's a good january fragrance you\"\"find it on sale you should get you know\"\"is that too much you only live one hi\"\"hat my mom was just sharing with me some\"\"bread that she's tried out you might\"\"tell him what it is i got this at whole\"\"foods they're calling it cinnamon raisin\"\"bread natural but it's vegan i guess\"\"yeah and gluten free it's got it's made\"\"with garbanzo bean flour and potato\"\"starch oh cool it's not um yeah garbanzo\"\"bean flour rice milk and an egg replacer\"\"so no eggs cool it tastes good i enjoyed\"\"it doesn't taste almond butter and i'm\"\"thinking it would be good i bet it would\"\"yeah whoo i guess an apple butter but\"\"that has so much sugar you can make make\"\"it it's pretty easy to make it like i\"\"thought yeah what's uh what's going on\"\"in your nails here oh look look my mom\"\"got a gel manicure\"\"no these are just a little stick on\"\"there pretty i guess that's something\"\"fun to do where'd you get that i bought\"\"these at walmart they actually look you\"\"did a good job putting them on there\"\"yeah they're pretty no-brainer yeah\"\"hey you know you they just have a little\"\"thing on the back you peel it off the\"\"sticker come on wow\"\"yeah yeah that sounds like something i\"\"could handle i wonder how easy they are\"\"to get off though i watched his vlog and\"\"she just hope you know one under here\"\"okay can't be so amazing no that's handy\"\"i don't think they're gonna last very\"\"long well i look you did a good job\"\"putting them on there i thought you got\"\"i thought you got a special manicure and\"\"i thought oh here she's going on the\"\"jail bandwagon whatever you have floss\"\"tubers she gave a really good tutorial\"\"about how about how to use you did a\"\"good job she always has the seasonal\"\"ones yeah\"\"yeah i've seen people talk about that\"\"what is it jam jam rapstar jam jam\"\"regeneration i showed what it is impress\"\"well they are pretty impressive looking\"\"helpful tips new yeah i'm impressed\"\"wasn't with houses how well they look\"\"yeah it's like you got a manicure they\"\"feel pretty we're awfully pretty sturdy\"\"and cut them down yeah i don't like long\"\"nails yeah we got a pinky one you want\"\"to put it on our path here's the final\"\"product i have my cauliflower oats i\"\"mixed in some blueberries and then i\"\"topped it with some of that cambria joys\"\"granola and my mom has these little\"\"banana chips that i decorated around and\"\"then i just dusted some cinnamon on top\"\"so that looks delicious i've got one of\"\"my tutti fruity spoons here and a little\"\"orange though that's what i'm having and\"\"then my mom has these strawberry oh\"\"sorry cos i really like

planner supplies here\"\"in this bag i've got these cute little\"\"panda know cards that i'm one of you all\"\"sweet people sent me so i'm excited to\"\"use those for list making this year and\"\"so yeah doing really well on my blue sky\"\"and all of my pens i really enjoyed\"\"these stadler pens they last a really\"\"long time do you have a son of the\"\"statler pens they last a long time and\"\"then update on my gelasa tees these are\"\"pretty awesome i recommend them these\"\"are by bic i really like the gelasa t\"\"pens they're know that they're to write\"\"with they're similar to the pilot g\"\"tubes they're very similar as far as\"\"their aesthetic and in the type of ink\"\"that flows but i caught him at cvs on\"\"they were on sale and i headed coupons\"\"yeah yeah i saw my apology to color the\"\"colored ones of those that i have i'm\"\"all out of but i have i like to write\"\"with the black ones as well so i've got\"\"some of those but i didn't bring them\"\"with me\"\"i finally filled this out have this\"\"little mole skiing book here that i keep\"\"addresses in and i just put my p.o box\"\"information on on the front here and it\"\"says as a reward is found sunscreen so\"\"sad i've had this little booklet for\"\"years and i'm finally using it for\"\"something something useful but i just\"\"finished up sending some cute thank-you\"\"cards here\"\"let it snow it's very january theme and\"\"i was able to use here i'll cover my\"\"this person's return address here but i\"\"decorated my um my envelopes with these\"\"cute little snowflake stickers to match\"\"that um i had i was using in my planner\"\"so one thing i'll say about these though\"\"you you got these right and michael's\"\"snowflake stickers those are from\"\"oh hobby lobby yeah their fyi i mean\"\"they're they're cute but they're not\"\"very good quality for i think they're\"\"called stickability\"\"yeah they're um they're little difficult\"\"to pick pick off of the off of the sheet\"\"if you're into stickers like i am what\"\"are you doing there texting and i just\"\"made myself one of my um my easy breezy\"\"hot chocolates all i do is i nuke some\"\"almond milk in the microwave for about\"\"two minutes and then i mix in a\"\"tablespoon of the trader joe's\"\"unsweetened cocoa and - - stevia packets\"\"and some cinnamon and then i add boiling\"\"water to at the top it's quite delicious\"\"so easy and i bet you could also make up\"\"put some not instant coffee in there and\"\"make it like january you got some good\"\"stuff in your sock i sure did i had a\"\"wonderful cause this is one thing that\"\"we got in our stockings this year this\"\"is a sample but the wild foods teas um\"\"this is this is a sample one we got a\"\"biggie pac right yeah have you tried it\"\"yet no i'm just thinking no we\"\"definitely need to do that yeah maybe we\"\"should try it this weekend it is it is\"\"what does this flavor over there comes\"\"with a cute little coloring doodle here\"\"wow\"\"wow very berry antioxidants wild tea\"\"yeah i'm looking forward to tasting that\"\"because i like the berry teas you like\"\"the traditional teas to the black and\"\"our ochre yeah you really like earl grey\"\"[music]\"\"well hey guys i just got out of the\"\"shower i ended up going to the gym and\"\"getting a good workout in and i just\"\"took a quick shower i think my mom and i\"\"are gonna watch a movie tonight but i'm\"\"doing a sheet mask here kind of what's\"\"going through some of the skincare stuff\"\"that i had from  and this popped up\"\"in my stash this is the let's see yeah i\"\"think the kind folks it may be beauty so\"\"she sent me this yes that is correct\"\"this is the hyaluronic acid mask\"\"concentrated hyaluronic acid moisture\"\"revitalizing firmness it claims by hera\"\"this is a korean sheet mask and i am not\"\"entirely sure what the ingredients are\"\"but as with most of the korean sheet\"\"masks heavy heavy-handed on the\"\"fragrance i can detect that right away\"\"but we shall see how it does i really\"\"like the fit of these that honestly so\"\"that's a plus for but it's it's pretty\"\"heavily fragranced a little eye water\"\"inducing but we'll see how it stacks up\"\"to the cream shop so far those are my\"\"favorite korean masks but far and away\"\"my favorite sheet masks as i said in my\"\"a skincare favorites of  have to be\"\"those hada labo ones from japan they're\"\"really just just like the hyaluronic\"\"acid some glycerine and no fragrance so\"\"i think they're they're a little better\"\"but anyways masking it right along i'm\"\"gonna just let that incubate on there\"\"for oh no  minutes while i chitty-chat\"\"with you guys because bringing it back\"\"to you it really what matters i wanted\"\"to chitchat a little bit about the via\"\"derma photo duramax spf  plus that i\"\"am so that i am going into january on i\"\"suppose this one of you kind folks sent\"\"me from from\"\"netherlands am i saying that correct\"\"please comment below i hae\"\"mispronouncing things so i always hear\"\"people saying in other lands but that's\"\"not right i can't be right so i think\"\"it's nit orleans right netherlands\"\"sounds right to me\"\"i should have google google guest a\"\"guest that before i got on here but\"\"anyways this is a sunscreen from france\"\"and yeah i did a little research on the\"\"ingredients online so i can be sure give\"\"you some accurate information rather\"\"just saying and it feels great\"\"this contains one one filter that i\"\"wanted to talk about it has a really\"\"long name so i didn't write it down here\"\"hon on a cute little little pineapple\"\"post-it note it's this ethyl axial oxy\"\"phenol methoxy phenol triazine which is\"\"essentially a bit much the motrin demo\"\"trigonal which the trade name see this\"\"is why sometimes having trade names is\"\"helpful because who wants to say all\"\"that but the trade name is tennis orb\"\"and tennis or blocks is a filter that\"\"will effectively cover both uvb and uva\"\"it is very very very photo stabile and\"\"what i mean by photostable oil is that\"\"when exposed to ultraviolet light from\"\"the sun it remains stable on the skin it\"\"doesn't degrade and so it maintains its\"\"its uv blocking capacity more so over\"\"what is commonly found in many of our\"\"sunscreens here in the us and buys us\"\"uva protection which is ava ben's own\"\"okay and furthermore tennis orb is nice\"\"because it it when it's added to others\"\"other other other filters alike ava\"\"ben's own it can further stabilize those\"\"so in the present it makes ava ben's own\"\"do a little better ok it's kind of like\"\"sound like a tutor or okay for ava benzo\"\"and it just it just helps it along so in\"\"short you know the european sunscreens\"\"have this ingredient and similar filters\"\"and other sunscreens that are chemical\"\"you know in japan\"\"it's been approved in europe since \"\"okay the u.s. is so slow on this\"\"bandwagon it's painful here in the us\"\"you know we have mex real and like\"\"unlike some of the la roche-posay stuff\"\"that you can get over the counter which\"\"you know stabilizes a levin zone to a\"\"certain degree but it's not as fantastic\"\"as the biskits rise all and demet rise\"\"all ingredients i don't know why they've\"\"taken so long to to get them approved\"\"here and then you add a spot that is\"\"that and another note about this filter\"\"so it's  the the trade name is tin\"\"sorb s okay there's also a tennis or\"\"best aqua which i learned about today\"\"tennis or s aqua is basically the tennis\"\"orb in a sort of methyl methacrylate\"\"matrix if you will\"\"dispersion kind of thing which basically\"\"allows it to go into water okay and i'm\"\"not sure bioderma has utilized that i\"\"didn't look into that but i feel as\"\"though it has and the reason that that's\"\"cool is that it allows it to go into\"\"water so it helps you know that the\"\"filter is can can be dispersed in that\"\"in sort of a liquidy form versus here in\"\"the us you know ayiva been zone is\"\"largely oil soluble so a lot of the\"\"chemical sunscreens people complain or\"\"just to oil and make them shiny make\"\"them greasy okay so you know yes\"\"tennis orb as far as a chemical filter\"\"is a little it's superior to do the ones\"\"we have in the u.s. period you know it's\"\"a little bit more stable and it's the\"\"aesthetics of how it can go on and what\"\"it can can do as far as as the vehicle\"\"make it more desirable to consumers okay\"\"so it has a larger consumer appeal and\"\"that's really important because you know\"\"a big big big problem with sunscreens i\"\"mean you know in general is not so much\"\"you know that the filter degrades or\"\"that you know the you know whatever it's\"\"really failure to use okay so that's why\"\"i always tell you guys you're always\"\"like what's the best sunscreen blah blah\"\"blah and what's the one that you like\"\"and use because you know i can\"\"on and on about the different filters\"\"and that sort of thing but you know if\"\"it leaves a white sheen on your face\"\"you're not gonna want to wear it you're\"\"not gonna run it want to reapply it's\"\"gonna be difficult if it makes you all a\"\"shiny greasy you're not gonna like that\"\"either okay and you know at the end of\"\"the day it has to be something that you\"\"comfortably can put on and and and use\"\"for yourself i really really wish the us\"\"would get this here you know we could\"\"get this here in the u.s. in japan and\"\"you know asia they have them in their\"\"sunscreens and so i'm very grateful to\"\"you for sending it to me another note\"\"about the bioderma are just these\"\"sunscreens that contain tennis or but\"\"another note about tennis or that i\"\"don't know maybe you all will find\"\"helpful you know i talked about my\"\"sunscreen qa there's all this fear\"\"around cancer promoting effects of some\"\"of the chemical filters you know in the\"\"laboratory studies if you put a bunch of\"\"like some of our chemical filters on\"\"cells and a dish you know you can see up\"\"regulation and certain estrogen and\"\"related genes and that's like very scary\"\"to people in general you know for\"\"potential breast cancer promoting\"\"properties as i said in that video just\"\"objectively speaking all the long-term\"\"data that we have from from human use\"\"does not support any sort of\"\"cancer-causing promoting of the facts\"\"okay\"\"but you know i'm you know i tell you\"\"that that's the objective information\"\"but you know i'm amanda thetic to to the\"\"concern you know if you if you know you\"\"or anybody you know has ever had a\"\"cancer before i mean nobody really i can\"\"totally relate to you not wanting to\"\"wait on the science to parse things out\"\"you know and just that that that slight\"\"tinge of uncertainty i totally relate to\"\"that i'm so a note about tennis orb you\"\"know is that unlike the other filters in\"\"those laboratory studies did not show\"\"any estrogen kind of regulating effects\"\"or estrogen dependent gene gene kind of\"\"alterations if you all okay so you know\"\"if that's something that you fear\"\"you know objectively speaking hopefully\"\"the information that i give to give you\"\"maybe can help you make an informed\"\"decision but you know i completely\"\"completely understand still not feeling\"\"comfortable putting it on your face and\"\"wanting to avoid some of these chemical\"\"filters here in the us you know if you\"\"can't you know fly to the netherlands or\"\"france whatever and get these or japan\"\"and you you know\"\"amazon's too expensive for you here in\"\"the us you know you've gotten zinc and\"\"titanium dioxide and zinc oxide alone is\"\"really pretty good at both uvb and uva\"\"titanium dioxide is a little less\"\"fantastic at the uva but they're both\"\"they're both good and you know in\"\"combination they're wonderful\"\"unfortunately they're the ones that are\"\"going to make you look white you know i\"\"have the white film so you know there's\"\"that and so selecting ones that they\"\"have you know micro-sized the the zinc\"\"and titanium dioxide can kind of help\"\"with that\"\"so yeah just a little fun sunscreen\"\"facts and one have you as i pull out the\"\"bioderma and we head into january with\"\"yet another french sunscreen bioderma\"\"hopefully i'm saying that right i hey\"\"you know i have a real mental block i\"\"practice sign oven all the time like\"\"when you guys are sleeping on the\"\"charger i'm like practicing saying that\"\"and i swear soon as the camera turns on\"\"i just like cannot say it correctly and\"\"it drives me nuts when i'm editing i\"\"just like want to punch myself drives me\"\"nuts i hate you know i'm mispronouncing\"\"things and i just think you know\"\"language is really you know that and\"\"opposable thumbs it's sort of what\"\"separates us from you know google if you\"\"although google can pronounce things\"\"better than i can\"\"anyways guys i hope you enjoyed the vlog\"\"i'm going to flip this off and probably\"\"rinse off some of the fragrance honestly\"\"maybe and come in with you sarah be\"\"moisturizing cream\"\"the tub that my mom has this is kind of\"\"her her skincare on when he's i mean\"\"talk about a minimalist this is all\"\"really at my mom has going on in night\"\"time skincare routine i think she just\"\"slathered this all over herself and\"\"calls it done like no mouthing no serum\"\"none of that just just just the tub but\"\"anyways guys i hope you enjoyed the vlog\"\"today if you liked it give it a thumbs\"\"up share it with your friends and as\"\"always don't forget i'm screen and\"\"subscribe you guys tomorrow bye\"\"[music]\"\"hi today i'm reviewing the bioderma\"\"photo derm max cream and really quick i\"\"just want to say it purchase all these\"\"products with my own money\"\"i'll never waste your time with\"\"sponsored ads or videos so if you want\"\"to help support the channel check out no\"\"bs beauty comm check out my patreon\"\"community or click on the amazon link\"\"below okay so finally getting to the\"\"other bioderma sunscreen i have and now\"\"that i found more sites that i can smell\"\"the products in i'm excited i've got\"\"three more in my cart although i don't\"\"really need three more but i just want\"\"to try them all and they're on sale\"\"so anyway i'm really getting good at the\"\"smuggling stuff i don't have to take it\"\"up a notch - maybe like acids maybe\"\"start smuggling in some really good bha\"\"products i don't know i guess i'll i'll\"\"see what i can move up to in the world\"\"okay so bioderma calls this a sunscreen\"\"with cellular bio protection patent to\"\"improve skins defenses against the sun\"\"uva protection of  and uvb protection\"\"of  plus and when they talk about uva\"\"protection of  they are going off the\"\"ppd persistent pigment darkening\"\"gradient system and i believe anything\"\"that's a  and over is like rated the\"\"best or like pa with four pluses after\"\"it and this one's got  so  is great\"\" is like out of this world which is\"\"amazing okay nourishing cream that is\"\"easy to spread the skin is protecting\"\"hydrated fragrance free non comedogenic\"\"hypoallergenic and water resistant okay\"\"so i get to my first criteria which is\"\"packaging and you know i noticed a lot\"\"of sunscreens come in yellow bottles i\"\"don't know why that is but so many of\"\"them do it just as looking through all\"\"my thumbnails i'm like yellow yellow\"\"yellow what ones that one is that anyway\"\"i don't quite get it but i have no\"\"problem with it in terms of denatured or\"\"drying types of alcohol this does not\"\"contain any of those it does contain c\"\"- alcohols which are fatty types of\"\"alcohol which are good or\"\"hydrating foreskin so i don't know so\"\"many of these alcohols contain a lot of\"\"alcohol but bioderma to figure out how\"\"to do it without it\"\"so what are they doing or what do they\"\"know that all these other brands don't i\"\"don't know they know something okay so i\"\"get to fragrance and there's no\"\"fragrance ingredients although it has a\"\"very very mild almost like corn smell\"\"like it smells a little bit like corn\"\"but it goes away pretty quickly i don't\"\"know how else describe maybe cornbread\"\"just a very light almost barely\"\"noticeable scent my nose is very\"\"sensitive though so i don't know but\"\"it's not bad doesn't bother me so the\"\"manufacturing location for this one is\"\"france so no issues with that spf on\"\"this one is  plus and since made in\"\"france they are only allowed to go up to\"\" so anything with a  plus indicates\"\"really good coverage probably  or\"\"above from what i'm hearing from you\"\"guys so it's pretty impressive\"\"protection from uvb rays then we get to\"\"the uva protection factor and this one\"\"is excellent far far above average this\"\"has like a plus plus uva protection the\"\"ppd level is  or ppd number anything\"\"over  on the ppd number is considered\"\"awesome great excellent  above is\"\"passing i guess so the protection of\"\"this one is just ridiculously high which\"\"makes a great option for those who spend\"\"a lot of time outside those who have\"\"significant hyperpigmentation issues\"\"those who have a history of skin cancer\"\"makes the bio during some sunscreens a\"\"really great option so they have done an\"\"amazing job with their photo derm line\"\"i've been impressed with both of them\"\"now i'm gonna be buying more so ok the\"\"filters used for this one we've got you\"\"v'l n  which is also known as octo\"\"cry lean which is an oil soluble\"\"chemical sunscreen agent which protects\"\"skin in the uvb range and somewhat in\"\"the uva range and it's also one that\"\"helps evil bends on be a bit more stable\"\"more effective and it's also one that\"\"people can have a lot of allergies to i\"\"think it's one of the more common\"\"ingredients where people are reporting\"\"side effects or allergies from it so\"\"keep that one in mind\"\"then we've got tin sorb m which is a\"\"hybrid filter that both reflects and\"\"absorbs both uvb and uva rays which is\"\"impressive\"\"then we've got evo ben's own there we go\"\"the uva reabsorb er and then tensor s\"\"filter a very photostable filter which\"\"absorbs both uvb and uva rays so a\"\"pretty good impressive lineup of filters\"\"that they've used then we get to white\"\"cast and um i'm kind of impressed with\"\"this one so they're plies pretty nicely\"\"there's a very very mild white cast i\"\"know right now it looks pretty blinding\"\"but once it absorbs it's more mild so\"\"not super super noticeable and the more\"\"it absorbs into skin the less it looks\"\"but it is a mild very mild white cast\"\"and how the longer you wear it the less\"\"its noticeable but if you're gonna\"\"reapply it that also becomes a bit more\"\"of an issue because the white cast\"\"you're playing over foundation and\"\"things like that so we'll talk more\"\"about reapplying things and half and you\"\"have to do it during the live stream but\"\"anyway once it absorbs the white cast is\"\"very very mild not super noticeable then\"\"we've got texture which it's got kind of\"\"a lotion aid cream texture to it which\"\"absorbs pretty quickly once you smooth\"\"it in once it absorbs though it sets to\"\"kind of a sticky and tacky finish it's\"\"almost like it doesn't fully feel like\"\"it dries down so if you apply foundation\"\"over it it's not gonna be as big of a\"\"deal but it is very slightly tacky and\"\"kind of sticky not as bad as some other\"\"ones i've tried like the drunk elephant\"\"sunscreens those are always super\"\"to me but it is slightly sticky and\"\"tacky and i would say the finish for\"\"this one is slightly radiant if you like\"\"a matte finish their photo fluid while i\"\"reviewed is kind of a better option but\"\"this one sets to kind of a more natural\"\"radiant finish which is slightly sticky\"\"so not the worst not the best but pretty\"\"decent still overall then we get to\"\"ease-of-use and it does take a bit of\"\"smoothing and effort to really apply it\"\"and to get it to smooth over evenly\"\"takes a bit of effort the texture is\"\"rather hydrating so this works better my\"\"opinion if you apply it directly over a\"\"serum instead of using like you\"\"typically in the morning i'll use a\"\"essence then a serum and then a\"\"moisturizer and then my sunscreen this\"\"one works better if you just eliminate\"\"the moisturizer step and just apply it\"\"directly over a serum just because it is\"\"rather hydrating seems to feel like it\"\"creates a bit of a seal over skin which\"\"is probably because the water resistance\"\"so it can be a bit fussy to apply\"\"certain foundations over them usually\"\"foundations that are rather hydrating or\"\"amoliant can be a bit iffy to apply over\"\"and then foundations that are super\"\"matte can also be a bit tricky but\"\"overall it's still pretty easy to use\"\"it's just not dummy-proof which is\"\"probably why it took me a month to\"\"figure it out no i'm just kidding haha\"\"i'm so funny i really can be funny when\"\"i try though so anyway okay\"\"antioxidants and beneficial ingredients\"\"in this one but a lot of hydrating and\"\"moisturizing ingredients a lot of slip\"\"ingredients in this one we've also got a\"\"few good ingredients we've got mannitol\"\"xylitol fructooligosaccharides which are\"\"great hydrating and moisturizing\"\"ingredients then we've got ram nose rom\"\"nose which is a ingredient which has\"\"demonstrated positive effects in both\"\"epidermal and dermal compartments of\"\"in-vitro reconstructed skin moreover\"\"such in vitro findings were obtained\"\"that has an effect on collagen four and\"\"pro-collagen one per day\"\"action so that's great for skin then\"\"we've got a ingredient which is known\"\"abroad which is a brown seaweed known as\"\"antelope kine\"\" i'm sure i slaughtered the name of\"\"that it's an ingredient that helps\"\"protect skin from oxidative stress\"\"caused by over exposure to sunlight so\"\"that makes it a natural fit for a\"\"sunscreen it's also rich in plant\"\"sterols that support the skin in a wide\"\"range of ways and then we've got act\"\"eine which is an ingredient that helps\"\"protect the skin from environmental\"\"stressors such as natural item\"\"pollutants so we don't have a super long\"\"list of antioxidants and beneficial\"\"ingredients but we do have some ab note\"\"and a lot of ammonia ingredients so\"\"overall i was kind of impressed with it\"\"i don't know at least some of the\"\"ingredients that they included as\"\"beneficial ingredients actually play\"\"directly to a sunscreen instead of just\"\"some random things so i don't know\"\"overall i was happy with it then we've\"\"got acne genic ingredients and this\"\"surprised me because it does have a bit\"\"of a thicker creamy texture to it but it\"\"only has one ingredient of note for acne\"\"prone skin which is paid  stearate\"\"which is a slightly comedogenic\"\"ingredient but that's it so overall i\"\"was pretty impressed with that so if you\"\"have acne prone skin this is a great\"\"option and there's not a lot of really\"\"great options out there so this is a\"\"good one then we get to animal testing\"\"and unfortunately bioderma is not\"\"cruelty free which i always every time i\"\"review a product if there's i was up to\"\"google cuz i was thinking the back of my\"\"head they are but they're not so that's\"\"important to note there we get to\"\"performance and this one will absolutely\"\"highly protect your skin from sun damage\"\"from uva and uvb rays highly protect\"\"your skin like very good protection\"\"lasts pretty well throughout the day it\"\"can become a little bit greasy towards\"\"the very end of the day after  or \"\"hours of wear it can start to look a\"\"little shiny but not tear\"\"believe so overall i was pretty\"\"impressed with this sunscreen for so\"\"many reasons high protection several\"\"unique beneficial ingredients great for\"\"acne prone skin well packaged well\"\"formulated so overall i was more\"\"impressed than not so then we get to the\"\"price and this is the full size which is\"\". ounces  milliliters which is a\"\"bit tinier than most other sunscreens\"\"also in a retails for about $ making\"\"it  cents a milliliter making it a bit\"\"more expensive per milliliter than a lot\"\"of other sunscreens i've reviewed but\"\"it's still rather affordable for\"\"something that's so effective so overall\"\"with a  being a perfect score this one\"\"got a  which is pretty darn good yeah\"\"so anyway i'm interested in hearing from\"\"you guys if you've had a chance to try\"\"this one out and if you have what your\"\"thoughts are or if you've tried in the\"\"other bioderma sunscreens out what have\"\"you tried and how have you liked it so\"\"leave a comment i love hearing from you\"\"guys be sure to join us on our\"\"livestream may nd at  p.m. central\"\"time and thank you guys so much\"\"hey everyone its michelle welcome back\"\"to my channel in today's video i am\"\"finally doing another sunscreen sunday\"\"and it's on one of my favorite sunscreen\"\"finds this year and that is the biodome\"\"or photo durham spf  plus milk high\"\"protection sunscreen i'm actually almost\"\"finished this sunscreen and i figured\"\"it's about time that i do a review on\"\"this before i fully run out of this\"\"product\"\"it says the photo derm milk spf  plus\"\"offers a large spectrum protection\"\"against some harmful ultraviolet rays of\"\"the sun it's anti uva uvb filter system\"\"and it's exclusive formula provide a\"\"scientifically proved high protection\"\"non-comedogenic will not clog pores\"\"other claims based on the bioderma\"\"canada website when i last looked at it\"\"or that it's suitable for babies\"\"children teens adult for the face and\"\"body smooth texture colourless upon\"\"application no greasy effect no white\"\"traces a uva of  and i actually got\"\"that from the shoppers drug mart website\"\"that it's a uva but  fragrance free\"\"paraben free hyper allergenic\"\"and moisturizing i purchased this for\"\"twenty seven ninety canadian dollars\"\"this comes in a hundred mil tube and i\"\"picked this up at shoppers drug mart\"\"it's an all chemical sunscreen and the\"\"filters are one of the main reasons why\"\"this is in my top sunscreen pics of the\"\"year it has % arctic raylene % tina\"\"sorb m % april been zone and .% tina\"\"sorb s we've all heard of australian and\"\"avo been zone in western sunscreens but\"\"the fact that it has both tina sorb m &\"\"s which are very photo stable filters\"\"that have very good uva protection and\"\"the fact that you could purchase this so\"\"easily over the counter at your local\"\"shoppers drug mart or a rec hall is\"\"incredible as you can hear this is quite\"\"a liquidy sunscreen and it comes in a\"\"tube packaging and again i don't like\"\"the packaging for as you can see that\"\"buildup is nasty here's the swatch on my\"\"hand as you can see it's a bit of like a\"\"thick lotion type of texture because it\"\"is still running down my hand although\"\"very slowly now i'm just gonna rub it\"\"into my hand now as you can see it's\"\"very smooth like this actually doesn't\"\"feel thick at all it feels really nice\"\"and light it's also making my hand feel\"\"slightly more moisturize now i didn't\"\"rub this in\"\"well enough but as you can see there is\"\"a slight cast on this hand here compared\"\"to my hand without the sunscreen and i'm\"\"just gonna rub it in a little bit more\"\"and keep in mind this is still like on\"\"initial application so it doesn't look\"\"ask caste now compared to my hand\"\"without it and it actually makes my skin\"\"look more even tone definitely shinier\"\"on this side as well but definitely more\"\"moisturized on this hand as for\"\"fragrance it's not noticeable at all\"\"unless you actually actively go like\"\"this and even then i can't describe what\"\"the scent is it's not unpleasant it's\"\"not overly industrial chemically\"\"smelling i would say there is like maybe\"\"a slight sour type of smell to it but it\"\"doesn't smell rotten or anything like\"\"that but again it's not a noticeable\"\"scent at all when i apply it on my face\"\"when i apply it on my face i actually\"\"try to apply it in two separate layers\"\"and i find by doing this it glides on\"\"the skin it very easily and it feels\"\"nice and light and as you can see on\"\"initial application there looks like\"\"there's a cast going on but as you can\"\"see in the clip  to  minutes later\"\"the cast subsided and i actually noticed\"\"the undertone in my skin still after\"\"waiting in the  to  minutes i\"\"definitely noticed my skin looks a lot\"\"shinier but it also looks a bit more\"\"even tone in terms of the feel it almost\"\"feels like i added an extra moisturizer\"\"on to my skin but this is definitely not\"\"as rich as the bioderma outer derm\"\"intensive balm that i use that one is\"\"very rich whereas this one it feels like\"\"it just leaves a nice moisturized layer\"\"on top of the skin this hasn't a\"\"waterproof claims on the packaging here\"\"it says apply generously prior to sun\"\"exposure\"\"reapply as needed or after swimming\"\"towel drying perspiring heavily and\"\"washing for extra skin benefits like i\"\"mentioned prior in terms of the feel it\"\"does feel like this adds a little bit\"\"extra moisture to my skin but one of the\"\"bigger skin benefits i've noticed when\"\"using this sunscreen is that my\"\"pigmentation has faded significantly in\"\"my current skincare routine i am using\"\"azelaic acid and different and i find\"\"both of those in my routine have\"\"actually helped lighten any pigmentation\"\"i have on my face but in the summertime\"\"i do freckle a lot and actually on the\"\"top part of my cheeks right here i am\"\"noticing some residual pigmentation and\"\"for the women in my family i've noticed\"\"this is the spot right here where they\"\"have received age spot\"\"but while using this in this some are\"\"actually noticed this never darkened at\"\"all and i never even got any freckles\"\"and usually all the freckles are around\"\"my nose and i haven't seen any this year\"\"this is an uneducated guess but my\"\"assumption is because there is some\"\"silicone in this product and it does\"\"make my skin look smoother and i also\"\"don't find this emphasizes any texture\"\"on my skin at all especially my large\"\"pores right here and on my forehead i\"\"find that texture never comes to the\"\"forefront when i use this foundation if\"\"anything it looks slightly subsided not\"\"blurring but subsided in terms of makeup\"\"in the summertime what i did was mostly\"\"mix a primer with that drunk elephant d\"\"bronzy just to give myself a little bit\"\"of a tint right now i am wearing this\"\"product underneath the foundation i am\"\"wearing mac studio sculpt foundation in\"\"the color nc  did n't go in with my\"\"touch of primer i just went in right\"\"away with the foundation after waiting\"\"the  to  minutes and powdered a\"\"little bit in my t-zone and i really\"\"like how my skin looks right now\"\"i believe i have tried the it cosmetics\"\"cc cream with this product as well and i\"\"never noticed it disrupting my makeup at\"\"all so for the overall pros for the\"\"sunscreen first point is the high uva\"\"protection this is formulated with some\"\"highly sought after photo stable filters\"\"that is not easily found in the western\"\"market especially for those of you that\"\"live in the u.s. so for those of us that\"\"are canadian or live close to the\"\"canadian border this is very easy to get\"\"at a local rexel or shoppers drug mart\"\"store also another pro is i find it a\"\"great amount for the price i mean \"\"mils for less than $ is really good\"\"they have this product and one of those\"\"large spray bottles so i don't know if\"\"the formula is slightly different from\"\"this so i was thinking of checking that\"\"out just because it comes in a larger\"\"amount i also like that i can use this\"\"both on my face and body i don't find\"\"this a greasy product at all despite its\"\"moisturizing effect and another pro is\"\"actually that despite it being an all\"\"chemical sunscreen this does not sting\"\"my eyes at all one of the biggest cons\"\"for this products like i mentioned is\"\"the fact that it can produce a cast\"\"although today it looked like it didn't\"\"give me that much of a cast for good\"\"measure i still like going in with some\"\"type of complexion makeup product i feel\"\"like even with the sheer foundation the\"\"cast on this is still fairly easy to\"\"cover another con and it kind of depends\"\"on what your skin type is like but this\"\"does\"\"use quite a bit of shine not just my\"\"face on my body as well so for those of\"\"you that are oily skin and tend to stay\"\"away from shinier products just keep in\"\"mind when you use this i would say a\"\"better option for those of you with oily\"\"skin for a high spf and you be a\"\"protecting product is the la roche-posay\"\"anthelios lotion not the one that's\"\"tinted but the regular one that one is\"\"an all chemical filter sunscreen and i\"\"find it does produce a bit more of a\"\"matte finish so i think you'd like that\"\"better than this one overall despite the\"\"cast and the shine it gives this\"\"sunscreen has been one of my favorite\"\"sunscreens to date and you'll definitely\"\"be seeing this in my best of beauty\"\"skincare edition around up and that is\"\"it for this sunscreen sunday i do hope\"\"you found this video helpful and\"\"informative if you did please be sure to\"\"give this video a like subscribe to my\"\"channel down below for future videos\"\"leave a comment if you have any\"\"questions or recommendations and i'll\"\"see you all soon ciao\"\"you\"\n"

      "hello guys and welcome to my channel myname is jesper fussing and today we aregoing to look at a sunscreen and weregoing to do at one of these those tintedones and what you would like to know ishow does it actually look color wiseso were firstly the one we are talkingabout today is the one from bioderma andit looks like this and the embellishlooks like this or the packaging lookslike this and first of all yes you wouldlike to know what is the spf and that isa  a plus on this one here and it saysthat it has the uva in a circle andactually it was so difficult to see it icouldnt really find it on the tubeitself but when i looked at thepackaging i could see that down here itsays that it has the uva in a circle sothat means that it is at least a  uvacompared to the uvb so compared to thespf now one other thing is that normallyi like to use well thats not quite truebecause the one i use does not have anystar ratings on it and that is the onefrom la roche posay dia on tintedversion but it is a good idea if you canfind something with this star rating onit and if you have at least a  to stars and that is something i would useif i went to the beach or if i knew ihad to be out in the sun for a long timebut just for daily use i use the onefrom la roche posay which is with a uvin a circle but it doesnt have any astar rating now this one here has the uvinner circle but i know star rating sowe cant really talk about that and whatyou would like to know is how is thecolor well if you look at how are theymaking the colours in this sort ofproducts then when they have attendedversion and the la rocheposay us thathad a has a tinted version and thebioderma has a tinted aversion and othercompanies has tinted versions as wellbut for those three that i mentionedthey are usingsomething called iron oxides and theyare using a yellow oxide a red and ablack oxide and then they are using itto tenem oxide as well the titaniumoxide is what will give you the sunprotection or what would be the sunscreen itself but this one here has achemical filters in it as well as theevent one is a purely a mineralsunscreen so why do i mention thetitanium oxide well i do that because itis very white and that is obviouslysomething that they are also using inorder to lighten the color of a productso its not so dark also it comes up tothe color that they wanted because wheni just said so is not so dark well thewhole thing about these tintedmoisturizers hood tinted sunscreen asthese ones are is that it its almostsort of like one color is supposed tofit all and i think we all know that onecolor certainly does not fit allso for sunscreens that i attended itshould be just like for makeup so forfoundations and a lot of companies arereally good at that now and somecompanies are not that good and i wouldsay that if you are still making asunscreen which is a one color fits ormaybe you have not really understood themessage so we are reviewing this oneanyway so what i would say about theiron oxide is that the difference isthat in this one here and the one fromeven then the first ingredients of theoxides so as they are listed in theingredients list is the yellow oxide andthat means yellow iron oxide and thatmeans of course that that product is alittle bit more oranjee whereas the onefrom the hospice aid that is so that thered iron oxide is listed first so thereis more red iron oxide in the one from alarge person and there are in the onesfrom oven and from a higher termand that you can already think gives asort of a difference in how the color isis more red or is it more orange ii andthen they also have a black iron oxidein it in order to make it more welldarker so it is obviously the mix aboutfor those iron oxide that are making upat a color so kind of like if you arelooking at a product you can read froman ingredients list if they have theyellow iron oxide listed above the rediron oxide then it is more to the orangeside and vice versa it would be more redand i would say that the brown from larocheposay is a it is red it is notorange ii i would say it it comes acrossas being too red so yes should we trythis one here and as i always say justtake something out and this one you cansign its a big liquidy so its notkinda like super fatty its more likeliquidy and i think they are actuallysaying that it is now it says in frenchmaybe it says an image and it says aquafluid tante tres odor protectionprotection is it spanish as french idont really do french i just try mybest but it tended aqua fluid very highair protection thats the englishversion for you that so sell it our bioprotection i mean what you like to knowis the color so lets have a look so youcan just see it is kind of like reallyliquidy so kinda like crips out of therethis one here and it really looks likewell something it looks like a makeupcream very good makeup cream and itmaybe if you can see the color comparedto my skin my skin is definitely not atent at the moment because i ambasically staying indoors due to thesituation that we are all in so i donthave that much sun and also means that iactually not used a sunscreen for a longtime because i am basically indoorsevery day so how does it look its veryvery liquid is very easy to distributeso it has this sort of a column but whatour lightest show is that a lot ofpeople they are using so littlesunscreen so where this one here has thesame weight as the one from the wash perse and when i use the one from thehospice a i know i need to use half ateaspoon of the teaspoons that i haveyour teaspoon might look a differentmight be small that might be bigger so ijust have measured and you can see avideo about that up there i will link tothat one how to find out how muchsunscreen to actually use so that for mewould be kind of like half a of theseteaspoons here so now you can maybealready see that them if i maybe cantilt it is very liquid about trying it alittle bit you can maybe see how itlooks how much it is and that is for myentire face and when i put it into myhand i have to remember that a lot ofthe cream will stick in my hand sobasically it is better just to dip myfinger in and then go along and then doit like thatnow im only doing one side i only haveto use half of the amount but you canalready see it gives kind of a bigsplash so this will just go on here andyou can see that it will definitelychange the color of my face so you willsee that this side by its on and this idont have anything on today i only havea summer setting powder on i dont haveany foundation on or something like thatso it is just sitting about a little bitof a highlight not to look at too tallon camera so this is a kind of like howit will look and yes i can smear it outand smeared out and smeared and continueto smear it out and a lot of it will betaken up by my hands but that was notthe point the point was that i need toleave it on the skin because itis there for a certain purpose and thatis in order to protect me from the sunso when as you can see this is rather alot of stuff to put on and just put iton my forehead so it is i mean one thingto say is that it is very easy todistribute it really easy to distributeits very liquidy and so on i dont wedont want maya to put this so i put itthere so dont want to have it all overthe place but yeah how do i think thecolor is when i see it directly and notthrough the camera where i know that thecolor would be a little bit differentbut i would say it definitely is not asorangie or its not as red as the larocheposay one so and its not as wheni spoke about the event mineral one icompared it to a chocolate ice creamthat i had as a child and which was kindof like um can i get grayish undertoneinto the brown where i would definitelynot say thatthis is like that so i would say this ismaybe color wise if you can maybe stillsee it this is kind of like imsomething inbetween the one from ourthen and the one from la rocheposay butum yeah i mean the other thing toremember about these things here is thatthey will actually act a little bit likea foundation and when you are puttingfoundation on you will use a settingspray or you can use a setting powderafterwards and i would say that that isexactly the same that you need to dowhen using something like this becausewhat happens is that i had it on my facefor several hours at the other day andwhat very quickly happened was that itstarted to run into the crease linesaround lines you get around the nosewhen youre moving your face so it veryquickly went in there and i mean oncamera it would have looked nice but inreality when people looked up close theywould be able to see that it all seepedinto all thelines in ones face all the mickey linesthat you get did it i know in my eyeswell not to begin with it took a littlewhile i would say it took maybe a coupleof hours and i did actually put it onvery liberal on my eyelids and it did asin other lines on the face in thecreased line on the eyelid it it verysoon just ended up being a read a lineas their so yes again that you wouldnthave needed to use some sort of asetting powder in order to keep it afixed so we didnt or my eyes yes it didannoy my eyes after a couple of hoursand i felt i just needed to take it awayand in order i thought maybe its justbecause my eyes are limpid dry orwhatever but then as soon as i took itoff and it was in the evening when itook it off so it was not like okay ithas been a long daymy eyes are tired and so on because assoon as i took it off and i dontnormally have it like that when i donthave a sunscreen so i immediately i tookit off and i didnt have that annoyingfeeling any longerso clearly it was the sunscreen thatannoyed my eyes and i would say with thela rocheposay one i used the untaintedone and it has never annoyed my eyes andthey do say that id use some sort of aanti i sting technology and im notsaying that that works really well and iwouldnt say it does not leave any sortof a cast on the face so if you wouldlike to have a sunscreen that doesntleave a cast on your face i would saythat the amount from a large per se is areally good choice for many reasons andthis stuff here i will say that its notas bad as the event one which started toreally like burn around my eyes on theeyelids around this very the eyes thethe area underneath my eye it started towarm and get the sort of burningsensation that just became worse andworse and worse i did not have it withthis one here to the same degree as ihad with the event one of us just like alittleit but it it wasnt that much i know myeyes it was more like receiving into myeyes and annoyed the eye itself so yesthis is how it looks and is it somethingi will use no it is not and it feelsanother thing to say is that it feelscrazy its easy to distribute on yourface but it just has this drawback thatits its its really crazy and it keepsbeing greasy and there when i looked inthe mirror when i was outside it reallydid shine to high heaven so it reallylooked really glossy so yes this is notsomething i can recommend but if youcant help yourself but wanting to tryit try it out see how the color worksand let me know it works for you if youwould like to see more the sort ofvideos please subscribe in tibetan toall those things to know to be notifiedwhen i put more disabilities thank youfor watching see you byehi im melina cop the pimple calm andtoday i want to talk to you aboutonce again my favorite brand thatdoesnt pay me for these videos yes imnot sponsored by this friend but i lovethem so much that i will shout my lovefor them from the rooftops every day imean seriously i have converted so manypeople onto this brand that its noteven funnytoday im talking about bio derma andspecifically since you know i am likethe biggest a sunscreen fan ever like asin i intend to look  for the rest ofmy life the reason that i can look for the rest of my life like the onething that allows me to do that issunscreen and so today im going to betalking about the biodermaphoto derm range of sunscreens sobioderma has many different ranges theyhave ranges for sensitive skin the senseof bio range they have ranges fordehydrated skin and the hydra bio rangethey have a range for acne prone skinthe sebum range and they have the photoderm range its the orange one thisrange is amazing because its sunscreenand the thing that i love about biodermathey provide broadspectrum protectionand they are often you know fragrancefree and water resistance and these arethings that you want to look for in asunscreen in order to get adequateprotection its really really importantthat you wear your sunscreenyou should watch my sunscreen video tolearn more about you know the differencebetween chemical and mineral sunscreensand all the rest of it basically thereis no better one as long as you wearsunscreen thats good the best sunscreenis the sunscreen that you actually puton your face the best sunscreen is thesunscreen that protects you but i meanthere are brands out there that areterrible that dont actually live up totheir labels like neutrogena so i do notuse brands in you know the typicalsunscreen aislein the like a big store like walmart idont know i only used sunscreens fromtwo brands ok bioderma or polish choicethats it i am like very elitist with mysunscreen it has to be the best the bestthe best the best because as you knowmany sunscreens clog your pores and forme being you know skin health coach itwould kind of be a little weird if i wasusing products that clogged my skin andmany sunscreens in like natural skincareranges contains so many different kindsof oils that they i dont know how theyeven protect the skin from the sun giventhat a lot of them have oils high up onthe ingredient list that you know oilskind of attract the sun as opposed torepel the suns on oil based sunscreenand no idea how that works from achemical perspective but i know what itdoes so on a poor level it clogs itclogs it clogs your pores so i have allof these sunscreens from bioderma andim gonna include the hydra bio spf in this because it is a very very goodbut if you want to hear about my reviewon this and watch the hydra bio rangevideo because this is an amazing alittle everyday sunscreen so ok letsbegin with me be the body sunscreenbecause many of us forget that our bodyactually tends under the clothes as wellespecially you know in the summer whenthe sun is so bright and so highespecially depending on where you are inthe world you know you can really causesome real damage and you dont want tojust protect your face your whole bodykind of matters you know and i thinkits very important to wear sunprotection liberally on your whole bodyin the summer and i love this becauselook how huge it is it is milliliters of spray sunscreen so youcan kind of get to hardtoreach placesby spraying it i warn you this nozzle isvery very strong this is spf  photoderm max but it depends on where you arein the world because i believe in canadathey only have spf  in this size andin this product so biodermais available literally all around theworld thats what i love about themthats why i choose by odor mites ipretty much can find it in any pharmacyaround of the world so i love howaccessible it is and i love how wellformulated the products are and i lovethat theyre broadspectrum protectionso you get uva protection as well thisone it does have an invisible textureeven though it comes out white and itspreads very easily so i really like itbut my favorite thing is like how big itiswell how much sunscreen i get biodermaproducts are really well priced for whatthey are for another one that covers thebody but can also work on the face thisis the photo derm sensitive spf  thisis literally probably the highestprotection you can get because it hasvery high uva protectionits almost as high as the uvbprotection here and what i love aboutbioderma sunscreens is that they oftenwill put the actual uva rating as wellas the uvb rating but they only do thisin europe keep that in mind because therating system hasnt been universallyagreed upon yet around the world so likeasia has their own rating system europehas their own rating system the usdoesnt have a rating system the fda istrying to figure that out now but europeis more stringent on ingredients therereally like on top of their i reallylike that they actually you know do arating system and it kind of allows youto know like this sunscreens has betterbroadspectrum protection then thissunscreen you know the rating systemdoes help because some sunscreens havelike a uva rating of you know  some some  and so i choose the highestpossible uva protection because uva raysare the ones that are going to jack upyour collagen make your pores weak andsaggy and more prone to acne so im likeyou no no no no thank you no thank youthis is a thicker product its extrememilk very high protection photosensitiveskin water resistance and withoutfragrance and its without parabens forthose people who are afraid of parabenall the bio dermis andmeans our without parabens and you doeither without fragrance i believe aswell as far as i can see yep fragrancefor me very very good product this oneyou can use on your body for likeextremely high protection this is forthose people who you know burn at theslightest bit of the sun amazing amazingprotection or like if youre out on thebeach where the highest protectionpossible like do it you know and tryobviously to protect yourself like anumbrella out some protective clothinghats sunglasses so that youre notburning your skin like its just not agood idea that tans are stupidget some selftanner get a fake tanthats what i do take down and ive usedthis on both the face and the body itsthick on the face but still does anamazing job this is something i wouldwear if im literally out in the sunwhich is something i tried to avoiddoing but if like im at the beach andthis is the sunscreen ill probably beusing on my face i also have this onethis is a photo duramax spf  im notsure that this is even available innorth america because in north america ibelieve that anything above an spf  isnot sold and its not that its not soldbecause it doesnt work or whatever itsjust that this is what happens with spfspf  protects you from  of the raceso  still get in spf  protects youfrom  of the race so you knowanything above an spf  is kind ofalmost the same as an spf  but when igot this product i think i didnt seeanything else so im like im justtaking it and this is very highprotection for a sensitive skin and itsa fluid texture so the texture is verylight but i do find it can ball up ontop of certain things so with somescreens you might find that if you uselike a siliconeproduct underneath things your sunscreenmight fall up and its just a matter ofexperimenting to find like the perfectcombination of products that worktogether that dont make the sunscreenfall up but what i do with this one inparticular is i wear it on my morningi just simply washed my face and withoutanything on my face on my dry face iapplied this sunscreen go for a run comeback wash it off and then do the rest ofmy skincare routine i dont wear spf every single day but what i do do is iwear do you do i wear spf  everysingle day a minimum of spf  but i dowear spf  when im out kind of morelike out and about when i know ill beleaving the house im definitely wearingspf  if its summer its gonna bedefinitely spf i do spf  minimum lets say springwinter you know when i dont see so muchsun but in the summer spring on dayswhen im out spf  is when i aim for itbecause i want to get maximum protectionnow speaking of spf  this is what ilove about bioderma they have awesomespf  these are both photo dermobviously but one is a r and one islasertheyre both creams and theyre bothvery high protection and they both havehigh uva ratings and all the stuff butone of them is tinted the ar is tintedso this one is tinted tinted dude theseare both like a pretty light creamtexture theyre not heavy at all ar istinted which i really really like itdoesnt have a white task on your skinwhen you apply it because its tintedbut its not like tinted as in its gonnacover all the imperfections maybe itdoes so just very very subtly enough forthose really subtle no makeup days ithink its awesome you can still wearmakeup on top if you want but i justlike it on its own and its been mygoto i tested this out thoroughly imalmost done with in my first ever bottleof this very close to empty what i dontlike about this product is that it onlycomes in  milliliters like its notenough for what it is because i applyingmy sunscreen generously like i go a biton with this particular sunscreen youcant be too generous because you canexperience some fillingwhen you use too much of this so youjust use the amount that you need to geteven coverage to protect your whole facebut still this is like one of myultimate favorite products probably everbecause spf  high uva rating and alsoa very very good texture and its tintedlike what else does a girl need this ismy goto summerproduct it has been to be fair mypolished tres sunscreen that is tintedbut spf  is coming soon i have notfully tried like an entire bottle yetim only trying to sample theres verygood feedback on this particularsomething that im talking about thoughi would love to kind of compare the twobut this price point is better than thepaulas choice and the spf once again ishigher so even if the polished choicemight be more cosmetically elegantwhatever this one is still better bangfor the buck spf  spf  in the summeryou know yeah i really love this productbut ive got the on tinted versionbefore i got the tinted version becausei didnt see the tinted version and so ihave both but i prefer the tinted oneeven though theyre both fantasticproducts its just you know the tintedone you know its just its tinted sotheres no white cast on your skin imnot saying that they all have seriouswhite casts but again im a pale personso thats something that you might wantto consider like if you have darker skinthey also this is the tent net you hadthe natural color but they have a goldencolor thats even darker than this oneso i would consider going for the darkercolor so that you dont have to dealwith the white cast that some sometimessunscreens have the back white cast kindof means that the sunscreen has somegood protection in there thats you knowdoing something protecting me i donthate the white cast in sunscreens ialways can you know even it out withsome powder on top my mineral powder isplus about spf  in it you can readabout it on my blog or ill provide alink below its very important that youwear sunscreen and throughout the day ifyou need to reapply your sunscreen imgonna do a shout out for the spraysunscreen from the hydra bio range itsnot in the photo derm range but itsreally really good plus the hydra by aperfect ur spf  is also an amazingeveryday product for you know spring andwinter like when youre not really outor like youre not leaving the housethis is the product i like to wear spf minimum even when i dont leave thehouse thats how legit i am too legit toquit and i like to carry this one aroundwith me in my bag so that i can reapplythroughout the day like on my bodyspecifically i really like this and whati recommend you do with in terms ofmakeup like if youre wearing makeupthroughout the day i know you dont wantto glob on more sunscreen right thatsjust gonna ruin your makeup and mightfeel gross and sticky and ridiculous soyou can either do a fine mist of thisbut i prefer to just dust my face verygenerously with a powder that has spf minimum in it and broadspectrum uvaprotection because mineral powders oftencome with zinc oxide titanium dioxidewhich is mineral sunscreen protectionand its really really good so you canjust be very generous with the powderthroughout the day that has sunprotection in it so that you arereapplying so that youre continuing tobe protected from the uva and uvb raysyou dont want to eat your skin thatsgoing to equal terrible skin i hope youreally enjoyed this sunscreen video mydream come true a video about justsunscreen but i try and wear

forwatching i will talk to you soon thiswas a winner pop the pimple bathtubhellowelcome back to my channel if you arehere and you are newyour comment as well today well betalking about this bioderma photodam maxspf  plus tinted creamsunscreen and i chose mine in colorgolden thisis for sensitive skin and if you want toseehow this is going to perform please keepon watchingso as always my morning routine i alwayswash my faceso that is what i normally do and youguys im not going to begoing into detail with that i just wantto show you just likethe process before applying thissunscreenso that you can see that this is agenuine review andwe are starting on a clean slate so whenim done i just pat my faceand i do not grab my face as i alwayssay so i just pat my facedry and then go in with any serums thatill be going in with usually my morningskin care routine you guys isvery very simple so when im done doingthat i like to go in with the serums ofthe day my morning serumsand just pat it on my face so that i cangoin with my biodemo of course you guys iapplythe moisturizer before this then go inwiththis sunscreen so it has been a monthsince ive been using this for sunscreenand i have a lot to say and this retailsfor  i got it from a discountand as you guys can see this is how itlooks this is how golden looks like whatkind of golden is the please make itmake sensehow is this golden color maybe you guysim just tripping but anyways that ishow our golden color is lookingi dont know on which skin or maybe inwhat skini have no idea guys but anyways wereworking with that colorand its just like a sneak peek just toshow you guys anyways i just wanted toshow you that im dressed soim not naked yall this is how my faceis looking before i applythe sunscreen now im gonna apply thisin three ways because i actually liketried to work around the sunscreenbecause already we can tell thatthis is not gonna be matching my skin atall so this is the normal way in which iwould apply my normal sunscreen thatdoesnthave any tint to it just to say guysthis is a chemical sunscreen soit is not a mineral sunscreen sometimesi would expect mineral sunscreens togive uswhite colors but anyways were still inum i dont know campaign to actuallybag companies to give us products thatare gonna match our skini dont know at all if its in its justdifficult to make something that isgoing to matchour skin colors or just this chemicalfiltersj theyre just white or we cant haveany filters that are going to match ourfacei dont know you guys but anyways i workthat sunscreen into my skin and yeah itis cool right anywayslets blend it um golden color into yourskin baby your skin is golden your skinisgold so you need to match your skin soanyways i waited for  minutes becauseusually with my sunscreenid like to apply  minutes before ifim not late you guys because sometimesi tend to bleed but anywaysthis is how were looking on the sun wowyall thisis beautiful isnt itso this is the second take so i figuredthat that wont work so let me try toapply thison my palm rub it on my palm and applyon my skin and see how this is going towork and as you guys can see im justusing the same amount thati normally use on my sunscreen thatdoesnt give me any white cast and youguys iam not slapping myself way too hard i amjust trying to make sure that it is inmy skin like its itsits just like penetrating into my skinone thing ill say you guys this productdoesnt goit doesnt penetrate my skin real quickand yeah if youve got sensitive skinthis will make you rub your skin becauseyou need to work it in as you guys cansee it it honestly looks a little bitbetterwhen i use that method of putting in ithen waited again for  minutes to seeif it will absorb to my skinand i tried you guys its not the bestbut it did try sowhen you put it in you rub it on yourpalm and try to work it in it is alittle bitbetter you do see a little bit of thatwhite cast but you just need to put alittle bit of worki hate putting a lot of work moreespecially in the morning we are late weare busy okayso i washed my face applied themoisturizer andthe trick yeah this is the trick youneed to apply your moisturizerand then real quick go in with thatbioderma sunscreenand rub it on your palm and you aregoing to work in layers if you work inlayersyou are not going to go wrong now theproblem is you are going to rub yourskin way more and it is not good forthose who have sensitive skini feel like it would work very well ifyouve got them like fairvery fair skin because this will justblend into your skin but youve got somemelanin if youre rich in melanin idont know you just need tolike make it work okay like you have towork it in less as im doing here so iwork in layers and you know applyanother layer andwait apply another layer and wait andthis was actually going in smoothly soit doesnt work well when you apply alot at the same timeso you just need to make sure youprepare yourselfearly before you actually go out becauseyoure gonna need a lot oflayers and patting in and if your skinbecomestoo sensitive through rubbing then itsa problem now im gonna give it to thissunscreenum it doesnt bend or stink it doesnteven break me out atall and it just it feels good on skinit does give a little bit ofmoisturizing effect and again if youvegot oily skin it tends to be oilierum greasy sort of during the day so ifeel like it is also friendly for thosewho have gotdry skin um i know ifyou have like oily skin and sometimesyou needlike products that are not going to beyou know super oily so yeah take thatso these are the pros its moisturizingit doesnt give me any breakoutnow um the cons you guys white castsit doesnt really go in smoothly it justtakes time to absorbmusicone thing that ill also say you guys isthat this sunscreen doesnt really workwellwith other serums so you need to justcheckwhich serums your morning serums thiswillnot roll more especially when you areusing the first and second methodit is going to roll so i find it work alittle bit better withthe moisturizer now that is it you guysfrom me the golden lady and thank you somuch you guys for watching please dontforget subscribe to like and commentand ill see you guys on the next onebyemy name is ramone cosmetic formulatoraesthetician uk resident and along withthat means i have access to some reallygood quality sunscreens and that was oneof the things that i was so excited forwhen i was first moving here if you guyshavent seen already i do have one videoup on a review of a handful of someeuropean sunscreens i got here at bootswell were back to do a round two i havea few different options in front of me ihave nevaeh or nivea i dont care how topronounce it if yall call me in thecomments that is on you bioderma andvichy today before i get into the videodo you want to say stay tuned hit thesubscribe button notification bell ihave an entire bag full of europeansunscreens i have yet to review i boughtpretty much the entire lineup of userand sunscreens i also have a videocoming up soon featuring easton freeziederm and heliocare so hit thenotification bell to know when thosevideos go live as well so lets get intothe sunscreens ill put a card up hereabout some other videos where i featuresome other european sunscreens but i amno stranger to these ive been usingthese now for well over six months forall let me see i use my handy littlequarter teaspoon to measure out thequantity i do a full quarter teaspoongenerally for face ears and neck but forthe video since this is face applicationi do half of this which is an eighthteaspoon ill work that in let it sitfor a few minutes so you can see thefinal finish and the look of it on theskin as well as if theres any whitecast so getting started first one wehave is from nivea this is their niveasun eevee face shine control this ibought a long time ago and actually gotconfused because i ended up buying twoof these because one of them on the boxjust said shine control and the other onthe box said mattifying effect and ithought they were separate thingstheyre not same thing this is fromnivea these cost six pounds they costcosted they cost six pounds when i firstbought them although now they are eightpound up boots but the magic of boots isa lot of times they have sales this isan spf  and it does have the uvacircled on it they do designate this ashigh uva uvb protection on the back ofthis it does have four star uvaprotection in the bootstar system somemarketing details nivea sun uv faceshine control offers sun protectionspecifically designed for facial needslight formula offers long lasting andinstant mattifying effects you will notethat the cream absorbs excess oils fromyour skins surface and youll beprotected from uv and high energyvisible lights which can cause prematureaging your skin will feel lightnongreasy nonsticky it is eye friendlyand ophthalmologically proven as wellworth noting compared to the other onesin the video this one is not waterresistant formula details uv filter wisestable benzone for uva octa satellitefor uvb tenosurp s broad spectruminsulazole for more uvb and then evenlt for qb as well this does havealcohol fragrance and essential oils inthere and so its really interestingwhen theyre like oh its sensitive skinfriendly but it does have thosecomponents and also the eye irritancyone is interesting as well because imean like how do you test that i knowhow its tested but realistically howthats a very general statement to makeconsidering how subjective skin feel andoverall experience can be with somethinglike this does have a couple things liketapioca starch and silica which aid insome of the mattifying oil absorbingbenefits to it but then it also has thisspecific licorice based extract and inthe marketing for it does say that thisdoes offer high energy visible lightprotection this specific licoriceextract in this is the same exact one inmy holy grail eucerin sunscreen butaside from that tocopherol acetate forvitamin e antioxidant benefits andthats kind of the extent of formulationstand out my experience with this youcan see with the application the texturefor this is like a little bit creamyits got a little bit more body its nota true gel which i mean for the sake ofcomparison the used saran that i talkedabout that is one of my favorites verygel texture this gel creams a little bitmore body to it and i just mentionedtheres a little bit more of anemollient component to the formulationof this it leaves a semiradiant finishand it looks like its going on like amoisturizer this is one of thoseproducts that i use straight afterrinsing as a one and done product thisis my moisturizer my sunscreen has alittle bit something extra in there aswell but i dont put much underneaththis because the texture of this is alittle bit more moisturizing you can seeas it sets down to me it just leaves anatural glow to the skin i dont thinkits its not very greasy its not veryheavy but it is a moisturizing finishwhats interesting is the mattifying theshine control that to me is a bit of astretch this to me is not modifying inthe slightest but it is very oily skincompatible the way i see it is it kindof leaves a natural glow on your faceand basically controls your oils frommaking you look any more shiny but youdo have a natural like radiance to youthat gives your skin some life yourenot flat matte dead but this is arguablyi think my favorite in this entire videoand i do use this very regularly becauseits very convenient for me especiallyon days when i need a little bit moremoisturization next up on the list thisis one i think i had a lot of commentswhen i went to the first europeansunscreen video being like try biodermatry bioderma so i got a couple from themthis is the bioderma photoderm max spf plus aqua fluid no this is the yellowtube this is spf  plus and this onehas no tint apparently they offer alight tint and then a gold tint for thisone i dont know what that gold means idont know if it means that its like mycomplexion or darker but this does alsocome in tinted versions i just have theregular nontinted one this was  poundthis offers high eva evb and t shineprotection i found on a separateretailer site because this is no longeron boots website dont know why this hada uva pf specifically of  and im onlynoting that because uvacircled anywhere on this i dont believeand also it doesnt give me a boot starrating either marketing points pleasantand easy application thanks to a fluidtexture as light as water dry touchfinish ideal for all skin types evencombination to oily sensitive skin orintolerant to all types of sunlight veryfair skin with freckles and exposed skinto maximum sunlight those are all theskin types and conditions that this isacceptable for oilfree formulanongreasy texture good skin tolerancenoncomedogenic unfragranced waterresistant and then main marketing pointsbehind bowdermist sunscreens is theyhave a cellular bioprotection trademarkpatent and that is essentially some sortof like antioxidant situation that theysay boost the overall sun efficacy andthat is some sort of like biodermaproprietary patent on a specificformulation component that boosts sunprotection factor of your skin andaiding with the sunscreen its themarketing for it was really weird but ontop of that this also has a synergisticcombination of three powders that give amattifying dry touch finish filters inthis this features octokrylan which isdvb into some of the longer wavelengthuva tinasorb m which is a hybrid filterit is a chemical filter by compositionbut its an insoluble particle so its asolid particle thats suspended in theformulation so it acts a little bit morelike a mineral filter you have ablebenzone which is uva  and uva  andthen latinos or m i believe is broadspectrum and then tinos orb s which isbroad spectrum as well so really goodbroad spectrum protection and then bumpsup on either end as well this is alcoholfragrance and essential oil free whichis worth noting because they do makecleanse this is like great for sensitiveskin or very compromised skin and thenyou have the things that help with waterresistance the mattifiers this does havemore emollience in the formulation ithink experience for this you can see asim depositing it into the teaspoon thisis liquidy and if i could just boil thisdown to one statement this is like thesister the wannabe sister of the laroche posay and thalios choco fluidsunscreen very similar texture and itfeels like it wants to be the sameproduct theres a lot of things thattheyre not the same first and foremosttalking about the uv protection mindsyou spf  plus no uva circled on thisthat i could find i also did throw awaythe box though so if you got the box andit circled on there comment that downbelow but theres also no boot starrating on this either and i did find auva pf rating of  which if youreusing like the ppd system like the papluses that you see on korean sunscreensthis would be a pa  plus technicallyand regardless that is a great dailysunscreen situation the other part ofthis is the fact that it says itssupposed to be matte with powder drytouch finish if you look on the screen ifeel like i look i have a gloss to meits not greasy but its like i lookshiny and i dont understand that and idont like the way this looks on my skinif im going to be honest part of thatreason is because after a little bit ifeel like my skin looks dry but oily ifthat makes any sense but also this hasthat tenosurp m component and imentioned it basically functions like amineral sunscreen it makes this cling tomy facial hair so it looks like iessentially have a dusting of like whitesetting powder all over my mustache myeyebrows my hairline and my beard sothis is one thing i like to wear undermakeup because i think it does prep theskin nicely for makeup i just dont likeit by itself and also the other part ofit is it does this thing on like myunder eyes where it gives them like agreat cast next up though from biodermaagain this is their photoderm akn matsnotice this is a white bottle and thisis spf  for this one uva is circledbut again no designation on bootstarsfor this marketing for this a biodermainnovation the exclusive fluid activetrademark patent in photoderm akn mattebiologically regulates sebum quality tokeep pores from becoming clogged andprevent the appearance of blemisheswhich is often exacerbated after periodsof sun exposure photogram akn matteoffers real internal biologicalprotection again that cellularbioprotection pen and then it also saysthis exclusive patent preserves andstimulates the skins defenses duringsun exposure so basically long lastingmatte claims nongreasy finish no whitecast they want to emphasize this onedoes have a sense to it and its alsowaterproof so talking about some of theclaims that fluid active was interestingbecause this one is matte i mean its inthe name matte this one specificallytalks about a patent to regulate sebumand keep the skin matte that the otherphotoderm didnt have the patentedcomplex fights against sebum thickeningin order to keep portion becomingclogged and to minimize the risk ofblemishes appearing which is interestingso this features salicylic and glycolicacid i dont think ive ever seenglycolic acid in the sunscreen periodand i dont think ive ever seensalicylic acid any sunscreen eitherthose are exfoliants which is fun i likethat again one and done products whojust love that get your exfoliation andyour sun protection all in one go but ithink those are partly responsible forthat seven regulating benefit salicylicacid as well as the component ofpreventing the pores from becomingclogged then you also have tocopheroland tocopheroacetate so both forms ofvitamin e then you have ectoin andpropyl gallate which are antioxidantsyou also have ginkgo biloba extractwhich always reminds me of fenty skinlove her and then golden kelp which is akelp extract and kind of aids in waterbinding so its like humectant benefitsbut can also potentially have some skinsoothing benefits or antioxidantbenefits as well filters this hasoctopriline so uvb uva tinosorb m onceagain so thats that broad spectrumhybrid filter and then evobenzone foruva protection less filters butinteresting assortment again this isonly spf  which is perfectly adequategreat daily protection or if you dontnecessarily need the high high highfactor because again this is waterresistant so its great for daily on thego or just like minimal sun exposurewhere for example you might sweat a lotbut again its interesting again i pointout this is spf  does have that uvacircle could not find a uva pf ratingfor this but the other bio dimmerdoesnt have that why is that but as yousee with the application similar bodysimilar texture its very waterylightweight it is giving that la rocheposay and thalios fluid this goes onnicely though i think i have apreference for this specific one overthe other bioderma what i will say isthat i also definitely like tomoisturize well underneath this this initself does have some emollients andbody to it but the mattifying effect ofthis on nonmoisturized skin can getvery unpleasant very quick so itll bemoisturized very well i think this isbeautiful for oily skin i wouldntrecommend these for dry skin im gonnabe honest just for that finish andtexture issue and for either of these ifyou have deep skin i would not count onthese just because of the teenage sortof m elements and then last sunscreenthis is the vichy ideal soleilmattifying face dry touch sun cream so iwas very excited to try some vichyoptions vichy to me its like a veryfrench pharmacy and i dont know whybecause i think technically bioderma istoo but vichys like the pinnacle oflike french pharmacy to me so i was veryexcited to try this out this is  pound for ml the marketing behind this isidiosola modifying face dry touch spf helps protect the skin against theharmful effects of sun into uv has softdry touch zero shine water resistantfinish they do say suitable forcombination and sensitive skin and thenits enriched with vichy mineralizingthermal water again this is spf  thisdoes have a uva plus circled there is nouva pf indicated on this either but i dotrust that this has good protection thisformula includes a white spectrum filtersystem and photostable uva ebv basedmixorals mixorals are loreal patentedfilters vichy is a loreal sub brand andthen that vichy mineral water so a lotof brands like lourish jose vichy reallycenter around this thermal watersituation and we should explain it likethis vichy mineral water strengthens thenatural defenses of the skin thevolcanic water of vichy was born fromthe volcanoes of ovarn rich in essential minerals so essentially itslike water thats volcanic waterenriched with minerals that can reallyaid in the skin barrier function andmoisturization and blah blah blah sofilter wise you have homosalatesoctosale evinol t tinosorp s mixoralxl avobenzone octocrylene mixoryl sx andnanotitanium dioxide so you got a wholesalad up in there of uv filtersprimarily these are all chemical filterswe do see that nano titanium dioxidealways a concern anytime you see amineral or mineral adjacent filter butits nano so that hopefully will aid ina little bit more elegance per se butaside from that this is alcohol free butthis is fragrance and this is fragrancedunderlying exclamation points this isperfumey its giving macys fragrancecounter the fragrance on this one isstrong and if you have compromised skinim gonna be honest my eye areas rightnow very compromised they were on firewhen i put this on so i dont know whythis is compatible with sensitive skinbecause i disagree thats just me andthen theres a couple botanical basedextracts for example theres a cinnamonbotanical extract in this which i lookedinto what it could potentially do skinwise and it has potentially a steadysauce some potential and antiterrorismand antioxidant benefits which basicallymeans it can kind of help with pigmentfading benefits and also someantioxidant protection the big one forthis one though is that its mattifyingits mattifying dry touch i agree withthose claims but i didnt find it was avery elegant experience you can see iput it on this is more of a gelsituation so its very reminiscent ofthe eucerin its not as moisturizingthough it doesnt have that annoyancethat the nivea one kind of does this onedefinitely does have this dry down likedry touch effect that fragrance is sostrong it does linger for like at leasthalf an hour afterwards maybe a littlebit more and thats definitely just thebiggest thing this does have thatfragrance to it texture wise this doeswear really nice under makeup i find itdoes prep the skin well im wearing itunder my face right now if youmoisturize well underneath this youdont have any issues with it cleaningto texture or any dry patches on theskin but you do have to moisturize evenhaving oily skin use a gel moisturizerbut you will have to pipe your skinadequately for this and you cant see itright now but when i look in the mirrori see it i just have like a coating adusting of whites on my facial hair mymustache and everything in my eyebrowsbecause of this and im going toattribute that more to the titaniumdioxide in this so its not reallyelegant in dark hair dark facial hair orwhatnot so thats another big con if youapply this in the right way this is verynice its very workable but you willhave to tolerate that fragrance so withthat that is round two of europeanchemist pharmacy sunscreens this was atoss up really some of these are notthat great or theyre like a verymidtier theres like things i could doto like bump them up but theyre justtheyre not great the nevaeh one i thinkis my favorite out of all these and i doreach for it pretty substantially let meknow

out my patreoncommunity or click on the amazon linkbelow okay so these were this is anothersunscreen i picked up at lookfantasticks uk page they should bepaying me like a referral fee becauseim advertising for them a lot anywaythats where i picked up most of theeuropean type sunscreens where is in theus its difficult to get them becausethe fda is about  years behind onsunscreen approvals literally i thinkits like been since  since theyapproved any new filters something likethat something crazy so anyway theressome ways around it i like to find theway around it because you know if youlive in the us and youre using atypical chemical sunscreen youre notreally getting great uva coverage anduva rays are once that cause wrinklesand fine lines and skin damage so keepthat in mind most americans probablywould age so much better if they hadaccess to european sunscreens but mostim probably a lot of them probablydont even know what theyre missinguntil youve tried them and not at leasti didnt so anyway bioderma calls this avery high sun protection with a fluidtexture as light as water with a drytouch finish suitable for all skin typeseven combination to oily skin skin thatis sensitive to are intolerant to alltypes of sunlight very fairskinned withfreckles and skin that as a pole exposedto maximum sunlight or anybody thatreally just wants to prevent aging okayso let me get to my first criteria whichis packaging and i like the packagingnice squeeze to bottle although it doeshave a tendency to be very goopy whenyou open it up and its got kind of aneedle nose tip on it so just keep thatin mind once you start once you dump itover itll start leaking out and illapply it in a second so okay no issueswith thatin terms of denatured or drying types ofalcohol this does not have any of thoseso thats always a good thing eventhough its got a nice liquid texture nodrain alcohols does contain some fattyalcohols such as sea  which are agood type of alcohol a few of youmention the crave beauty beat the beatthe sunscreen beat the sun sunscreenwhich i reviewed a few days ago andreally liked a lot of thecharacteristics of it but were not soexcited that alcohol is higher up on theingredient list in my opinion this is agood alternative to that its got all ofthe good characteristics of it withoutthe alcohol so i mentioned that assomething worth checking out if you werea very sensitive skin or a bit nervousabout thatso something worth considering terms offragrance this does not have anyfragrance in it which is great and noscent at all it doesnt even have thechemical sunscreen smell which most or alot of chemical sunscreens have so thisones awesome because theres literallyno scent to it so very great forsensitive skin in terms of themanufacturing location this one is madein france so no issues at all with thatspf coverage which is uvb coverage isplus so that means its great irecommend at least  everyday and  isgreat especially if you wear afoundation over your sunscreen the morelayers you apply over sunscreen the morediluted the coverage potentially can bei saw on a chart the other day it was asunscreen product the chart had the listof order of ingredients or what you useso you cleanse you tone serum sunscreenprimer then foundation and i thought youknow what i always apply my primerbefore the sunscreen just because anylayer you put over it has a potential tokind of decrease the amount ofprotection youre getting so somethingworth considering i always play myprimer before hand although it kind ofsometimes defeats a bit of the point ofprimer so even just foundation couldkind of dilute it a little bit so ithats why i think in my opinion thirtyis the least but fifty is goodespecially if youre gonna playfoundation or makeup over it its justyoure getting much better protectionalthough one thing to keep in mind theamok you go over thirty youre notgetting youre not getting twenty morethan third it kind of decreases a littlebit the higher up you go but its stillstronger and better so okay terms of theuva protection factor this one has a ppdof twenty four which is something iwould wanted to remember to mention itmore often which is persistent pigmentdarkening so sixteen and up on thatscale qualifies as adequate protectionthe higher up the number the better somesunscreens have demonstrated a ppd of or higher so thats very good coverageso this ones twenty four so thatspretty good up there pretty good upthere pretty good pretty high up thereso i have no issues with that itsprobably much better than the average ussunscreen okay then in terms of thefilters used in this weve got evo benzone which is a uv avery absorber whichis typically unstable but it can behelped with the use of other filters init which can help it be a bit morestable although avo ben zone on its ownfor just uva rays is probably what mostus sunscreens have and its not not goodenough in my opinion so then weve gotocto cry lean which is a uvb absorberand it also has the ability to absorbsome short uva rays im sorry if you canhear my dogs barking i know someone mustbe walking up and down the street ortheres a squirrel in the yard so imsure you can hear it im sorry okaythen weve got methyleneyou know there must be like a turkey inthe yard or somethingokay then ive got methylene biz benzatrion tetramethyl beautiful which isalso known as vis acht result which is abroadspectrum uva and uvb ray absorberit also has some ability to reflect andscatter uv light so its a great filterthen weve got tin syrup s which is auva and uvb ray absorber also very photostable so weve got a good variety offilters for both uva and uvb rays so ihave no issues with that then we getinto the white cast and i will apply itand this one really doesnt have a whitecast see how liquidy it comes out manthe dogs are just going crazy okay soafter you apply it it does take a minuteto really soak it in but for the mostpart theres not much of a white castinitially it looks like youre gonnahave a white cast and maybe it has avery mild white cast but for the mostpart in my opinion this is one of thebetter sunscreens in terms of whitecasts because there isnt much once itabsorbs really sets to a nice mattefinish with not much minimal white castif anything and there you go so i in myopinion you cant really see a whitecast so and after its so give after yougive it a couple minutes to soak in itreally has no light cast lincoln honeywhat trouble are you causing those tailsare just out of controlnotty okay so ill do a ph test just foryou guys and gals i love the ph soi would say its a ph of about five ishmaybe five and a half maybe so no issueswith that one okay in terms of textureobviously its a very goopy liquidytexture which isnt always the easiestto work with because it is so liquidyalthough i guess in the title aqua fluidi guess you get that although what ilike about it is after its soaked inafter youve given a few minutes to soakin it really scents to a nice matte nonsticky finish which is a big deal for alot of people so after you give it aminute or two to soak in its really notsticking doesnt transfer a ton sothats always a nice factor as well sono issues with the texture although iguess it says its fluid ease of use sosmooths over skin very easily slightlyhydrating works well over mostmoisturizers and primers i could give aminute to absorb sets to a niceinvisible finish a great option forthose that dont wear foundation or evenif you do our foundation good option forthat too but i know a lot of people thatdont wear foundation really likesomething that sets to a nice mattefinish with no noticeable white cast sothere we goand now that its absorbed its notsticky at all so very nice okay then interms of antioxidants and beneficialingredients this one contains a lot ofslip and basic hydrating ingredients nota ton of real beneficial ingredients orantioxidants which is kind of in myopinion the major downside with this oneis theres really not a ton of greatstuff its got vitamin e which is greatxylitol and mannitol which are bothhumectants and thats about it forreally exciting beneficial ingredientsso if youre gonna use this one i reallyrecommend applying over a really goodvitamin c serum or another greathydrating serum or moisturizer sothats got some good things for yourskin so your skin isnt just totallyrelying on this to do it all because itreally it can it can block the rays butit cant help really hydrate skin oranything else for that matter so keepthat one in mind that in terms of acnegenic ingredients does have a few acnetriggers so weve got glyceryl stearatecitrate which is a fungal acne triggerand then vitamin e which is can be veryacne genic for some people so thatsabout it so pretty friendly for acneprone skin with the exception of thevitamin e then weve got animal testingand unfortunately bioderma is notcruelty free which surprised me becausefor some reason i guess its been awhile since i reviewed anything forbioderma but they are sold in mainlandchina so theyre not cruelty free thenin terms of performance im really happywith it lasts nicely on skin withoutbreaking up foundation or becoming oilyor greasy feeling throughout the daypartially water resistant as well greatfor sensitive skin especially with thefact that has no alcohol and nofragrance performs above average itexceeded my expectations in my opinionso its quite happy with it it does takea little bit of finesse to remove at theend of the day the more water resistantthe sunscreen is the trickier i findthem to be to remove they just require abit more effort so if you use this onemight be wise to do a two step cleanseso oil based cleanser first and then asoapy cleanser after that just to makesure you move it all because youcertainly dont want to go to bed withany traces of sunscreen on your skinjust for so many reasons especially acneand things like that okay then in termsof the price so this is the full sizewhich is  ounces which is theequivalent of  milliliters and retailsfor about  dollars wherever your lookso that averages out to about  centsper milliliter which is in the veryaffordable ringits not the cheapest sunscreen ivereviewed but its also not the mostexpensive so thats a nice factor so onthe saris car scale with  beingperfect this one is guarded  so prettygood couple things i might mess with onit maybe not but overall its stillpretty pretty darn good option so anywayim interested in hearing from you guysif youve had a chance to try this ithink theres another bioderma productcoming up that ill be reviewing thisweek as well so be sure to stay tunedfor that one so anyway i love hearingfrom you guys so leave your comments andi will see you more

of the skincare stuffthat i had from  and this popped upin my stash this is the lets see yeah ithink the kind folks it may be beauty soshe sent me this yes that is correctthis is the hyaluronic acid maskconcentrated hyaluronic acid moisturerevitalizing firmness it claims by herathis is a korean sheet mask and i am notentirely sure what the ingredients arebut as with most of the korean sheetmasks heavy heavyhanded on thefragrance i can detect that right awaybut we shall see how it does i reallylike the fit of these that honestly sothats a plus for but its its prettyheavily fragranced a little eye waterinducing but well see how it stacks upto the cream shop so far those are myfavorite korean masks but far and awaymy favorite sheet masks as i said in mya skincare favorites of  have to bethose hada labo ones from japan theyrereally just just like the hyaluronicacid some glycerine and no fragrance soi think theyre theyre a little betterbut anyways masking it right along imgonna just let that incubate on therefor oh no  minutes while i chittychatwith you guys because bringing it backto you it really what matters i wantedto chitchat a little bit about the viaderma photo duramax spf  plus that iam so that i am going into january on isuppose this one of you kind folks sentme from fromnetherlands am i saying that correctplease comment below i haemispronouncing things so i always hearpeople saying in other lands but thatsnot right i cant be right so i thinkits nit orleans right netherlandssounds right to mei should have google google guest aguest that before i got on here butanyways this is a sunscreen from franceand yeah i did a little research on theingredients online so i can be sure giveyou some accurate information ratherjust saying and it feels greatthis contains one one filter that iwanted to talk about it has a reallylong name so i didnt write it down herehon on a cute little little pineapplepostit note its this ethyl axial oxyphenol methoxy phenol triazine which isessentially a bit much the motrin demotrigonal which the trade name see thisis why sometimes having trade names ishelpful because who wants to say allthat but the trade name is tennis orband tennis or blocks is a filter thatwill effectively cover both uvb and uvait is very very very photo stabile andwhat i mean by photostable oil is thatwhen exposed to ultraviolet light fromthe sun it remains stable on the skin itdoesnt degrade and so it maintains itsits uv blocking capacity more so overwhat is commonly found in many of oursunscreens here in the us and buys usuva protection which is ava bens ownokay and furthermore tennis orb is nicebecause it it when its added to othersother other other filters alike avabens own it can further stabilize thoseso in the present it makes ava bens owndo a little better ok its kind of likesound like a tutor or okay for ava benzoand it just it just helps it along so inshort you know the european sunscreenshave this ingredient and similar filtersand other sunscreens that are chemicalyou know in japanits been approved in europe since okay the us is so slow on thisbandwagon its painful here in the usyou know we have mex real and likeunlike some of the la rocheposay stuffthat you can get over the counter whichyou know stabilizes a levin zone to acertain degree but its not as fantasticas the biskits rise all and demet riseall ingredients i dont know why theyvetaken so long to to get them approvedhere and then you add a spot that isthat and another note about this filterso its  the the trade name is tinsorb s okay theres also a tennis orbest aqua which i learned about todaytennis or s aqua is basically the tennisorb in a sort of methyl methacrylatematrix if you willdispersion kind of thing which basicallyallows it to go into water okay and imnot sure bioderma has utilized that ididnt look into that but i feel asthough it has and the reason that thatscool is that it allows it to go intowater so it helps you know that thefilter is can can be dispersed in thatin sort of a liquidy form versus here inthe us you know ayiva been zone islargely oil soluble so a lot of thechemical sunscreens people complain orjust to oil and make them shiny makethem greasy okay so you know yestennis orb as far as a chemical filteris a little its superior to do the oneswe have in the us period you know itsa little bit more stable and its theaesthetics of how it can go on and whatit can can do as far as as the vehiclemake it more desirable to consumers okayso it has a larger consumer appeal andthats really important because you knowa big big big problem with sunscreens imean you know in general is not so muchyou know that the filter degrades orthat you know the you know whatever itsreally failure to use okay so thats whyi always tell you guys youre alwayslike whats the best sunscreen blah blahblah and whats the one that you likeand use because you know i canon and on about the different filtersand that sort of thing but you know ifit leaves a white sheen on your faceyoure not gonna want to wear it yourenot gonna run it want to reapply itsgonna be difficult if it makes you all ashiny greasy youre not gonna like thateither okay and you know at the end ofthe day it has to be something that youcomfortably can put on and and and usefor yourself i really really wish the uswould get this here you know we couldget this here in the us in japan andyou know asia they have them in theirsunscreens and so im very grateful toyou for sending it to me another noteabout the bioderma are just thesesunscreens that contain tennis or butanother note about tennis or that idont know maybe you all will findhelpful you know i talked about mysunscreen qa theres all this feararound cancer promoting effects of someof the chemical filters you know in thelaboratory studies if you put a bunch oflike some of our chemical filters oncells and a dish you know you can see upregulation and certain estrogen andrelated genes and thats like very scaryto people in general you know forpotential breast cancer promotingproperties as i said in that video justobjectively speaking all the longtermdata that we have from from human usedoes not support any sort ofcancercausing promoting of the factsokaybut you know im you know i tell youthat thats the objective informationbut you know im amanda thetic to to theconcern you know if you if you know youor anybody you know has ever had acancer before i mean nobody really i cantotally relate to you not wanting towait on the science to parse things outyou know and just that that that slighttinge of uncertainty i totally relate tothat im so a note about tennis orb youknow is that unlike the other filters inthose laboratory studies did not showany estrogen kind of regulating effectsor estrogen dependent gene gene kind ofalterations if you all okay so you knowif thats something that you fearyou know objectively speaking hopefullythe information that i give to give youmaybe can help you make an informeddecision but you know i completelycompletely understand still not feelingcomfortable putting it on your face andwanting to avoid some of these chemicalfilters here in the us you know if youcant you know fly to the netherlands orfrance whatever and get these or japanand you you knowamazons too expensive for you here inthe us you know youve gotten zinc andtitanium dioxide and zinc oxide alone isreally pretty good at both uvb and uvatitanium dioxide is a little lessfantastic at the uva but theyre boththeyre both good and you know incombination theyre wonderfulunfortunately theyre the ones that aregoing to make you look white you know ihave the white film so you know theresthat and so selecting ones that theyhave you know microsized the the zincand titanium dioxide can kind of helpwith thatso yeah just a little fun sunscreenfacts and one have you as i pull out thebioderma and we head into january withyet another french sunscreen

bioderma sunscreen i have and nowthat i found more sites that i can smellthe products in im excited ive gotthree more in my cart although i dontreally need three more but i just wantto try them all and theyre on saleso anyway im really getting good at thesmuggling stuff i dont have to take itup a notch  maybe like acids maybestart smuggling in some really good bhaproducts i dont know i guess ill illsee what i can move up to in the worldokay so bioderma calls this a sunscreenwith cellular bio protection patent toimprove skins defenses against the sunuva protection of  and uvb protectionof  plus and when they talk about uvaprotection of  they are going off theppd persistent pigment darkeninggradient system and i believe anythingthats a  and over is like rated thebest or like pa with four pluses afterit and this ones got  so  is great is like out of this world which isamazing okay nourishing cream that iseasy to spread the skin is protectinghydrated fragrance free non comedogenichypoallergenic and water resistant okayso i get to my first criteria which ispackaging and you know i noticed a lotof sunscreens come in yellow bottles idont know why that is but so many ofthem do it just as looking through allmy thumbnails im like yellow yellowyellow what ones that one is that anywayi dont quite get it but i have noproblem with it in terms of denatured ordrying types of alcohol this does notcontain any of those it does contain c alcohols which are fatty types ofalcohol which are good orhydrating foreskin so i dont know somany of these alcohols contain a lot ofalcohol but bioderma to figure out howto do it without itso what are they doing or what do theyknow that all these other brands dont idont know they know something okay so iget to fragrance and theres nofragrance ingredients although it has avery very mild almost like corn smelllike it smells a little bit like cornbut it goes away pretty quickly i dontknow how else describe maybe cornbreadjust a very light almost barelynoticeable scent my nose is verysensitive though so i dont know butits not bad doesnt bother me so themanufacturing location for this one isfrance so no issues with that spf onthis one is  plus and since made infrance they are only allowed to go up to so anything with a  plus indicatesreally good coverage probably  orabove from what im hearing from youguys so its pretty impressiveprotection from uvb rays then we get tothe uva protection factor and this oneis excellent far far above average thishas like a plus plus uva protection theppd level is  or ppd number anythingover  on the ppd number is consideredawesome great excellent  above ispassing i guess so the protection ofthis one is just ridiculously high whichmakes a great option for those who spenda lot of time outside those who havesignificant hyperpigmentation issuesthose who have a history of skin cancermakes the bio during some sunscreens areally great option so they have done anamazing job with their photo derm lineive been impressed with both of themnow im gonna be buying more so ok thefilters used for this one weve got youvl n  which is also known as octocry lean which is an oil solublechemical sunscreen agent which protectsskin in the uvb range and somewhat inthe uva range and its also one thathelps evil bends on be a bit more stablemore effective and its also one thatpeople can have a lot of allergies to ithink its one of the more commoningredients where people are reportingside effects or allergies from it sokeep that one in mindthen weve got tin sorb m which is ahybrid filter that both reflects andabsorbs both uvb and uva rays which isimpressivethen weve got evo bens own there we gothe uva reabsorb er and then tensor sfilter a very photostable filter whichabsorbs both uvb and uva rays so apretty good impressive lineup of filtersthat theyve used then we get to whitecast and um im kind of impressed withthis one so theyre plies pretty nicelytheres a very very mild white cast iknow right now it looks pretty blindingbut once it absorbs its more mild sonot super super noticeable and the moreit absorbs into skin the less it looksbut it is a mild very mild white castand how the longer you wear it the lessits noticeable but if youre gonnareapply it that also becomes a bit moreof an issue because the white castyoure playing over foundation andthings like that so well talk moreabout reapplying things and half and youhave to do it during the live stream butanyway once it absorbs the white cast isvery very mild not super noticeable thenweve got texture which its got kind ofa lotion aid cream texture to it whichabsorbs pretty quickly once you smoothit in once it absorbs though it sets tokind of a sticky and tacky finish itsalmost like it doesnt fully feel likeit dries down so if you apply foundationover it its not gonna be as big of adeal but it is very slightly tacky andkind of sticky not as bad as some otherones ive tried like the drunk elephantsunscreens those are always superto me but it is slightly sticky andtacky and i would say the finish forthis one is slightly radiant if you likea matte finish their photo fluid while ireviewed is kind of a better option butthis one sets to kind of a more naturalradiant finish which is slightly stickyso not the worst not the best but prettydecent still overall then we get toeaseofuse and it does take a bit ofsmoothing and effort to really apply itand to get it to smooth over evenlytakes a bit of effort the texture israther hydrating so this works better myopinion if you apply it directly over aserum instead of using like youtypically in the morning ill use aessence then a serum and then amoisturizer and then my sunscreen thisone works better if you just eliminatethe moisturizer step and just apply itdirectly over a serum just because it israther hydrating seems to feel like itcreates a bit of a seal over skin whichis probably because the water resistanceso it can be a bit fussy to applycertain foundations over them usuallyfoundations that are rather hydrating oramoliant can be a bit iffy to apply overand then foundations that are supermatte can also be a bit tricky butoverall its still pretty easy to useits just not dummyproof which isprobably why it took me a month tofigure it out no im just kidding hahaim so funny i really can be funny wheni try though so anyway okayantioxidants and beneficial ingredientsin this one but a lot of hydrating andmoisturizing ingredients a lot of slipingredients in this one weve also got afew good ingredients weve got mannitolxylitol fructooligosaccharides which aregreat hydrating and moisturizingingredients then weve got ram nose romnose which is a ingredient which hasdemonstrated positive effects in bothepidermal and dermal compartments ofinvitro reconstructed skin moreoversuch in vitro findings were obtainedthat has an effect on collagen four andprocollagen one per dayaction so thats great for skin thenweve got a ingredient which is knownabroad which is a brown seaweed known asantelope kine im sure i slaughtered the name ofthat its an ingredient that helpsprotect skin from oxidative stresscaused by over exposure to sunlight sothat makes it a natural fit for asunscreen its also rich in plantsterols that support the skin in a widerange of ways and then weve got acteine which is an ingredient that helpsprotect the skin from environmentalstressors such as natural itempollutants so we dont have a super longlist of antioxidants and beneficialingredients but we do have some ab noteand a lot of ammonia ingredients sooverall i was kind of impressed with iti dont know at least some of theingredients that they included asbeneficial ingredients actually playdirectly to a sunscreen instead of justsome random things so i dont knowoverall i was happy with it then wevegot acne genic ingredients and thissurprised me because it does have a bitof a thicker creamy texture to it but itonly has one ingredient of note for acneprone skin which is paid  stearatewhich is a slightly comedogenicingredient but thats it so overall iwas pretty impressed with that so if youhave acne prone skin this is a greatoption and theres not a lot of reallygreat options out there so this is agood one then we get to animal testingand unfortunately bioderma is notcruelty free which i always every time ireview a product if theres i was up togoogle cuz i was thinking the back of myhead they are but theyre not so thatsimportant to note there we get toperformance and this one will absolutelyhighly protect your skin from sun damagefrom uva and uvb rays highly protectyour skin like very good protectionlasts pretty well throughout the day itcan become a little bit greasy towardsthe very end of the day after  or hours of wear it can start to look alittle shiny but not tearbelieve so overall i was prettyimpressed with this sunscreen for somany reasons high protection severalunique beneficial ingredients great foracne prone skin well packaged wellformulated so overall i was moreimpressed than not so then we get to theprice and this is the full size which is ounces  milliliters which is abit tinier than most other sunscreensalso in a retails for about  makingit  cents a milliliter making it a bitmore expensive per milliliter than a lotof other sunscreens ive reviewed butits still rather affordable forsomething thats so effective so overallwith a  being a perfect score this onegot a  which is pretty darn good yeahso anyway im interested in hearing fromyou guys if youve had a chance to trythis one out and if you have what yourthoughts are or if youve tried in theother bioderma sunscreens out what haveyou tried and how have you liked it soleave a comment i love hearing from youguys be sure to join us on ourlivestream may nd at  pm centraltime and thank you guys so muchhey everyone its michelle welcome backto my channel in todays video i amfinally doing another sunscreen sundayand its on one of my favorite sunscreenfinds this year and that is the biodomeor photo durham spf  plus milk highprotection sunscreen im actually almostfinished this sunscreen and i figuredits about time that i do a review onthis before i fully run out of thisproductit says the photo derm milk spf  plusoffers a large spectrum protectionagainst some harmful ultraviolet rays ofthe sun its anti uva uvb filter systemand its exclusive formula provide ascientifically proved high protectionnoncomedogenic will not clog poresother claims based on the biodermacanada website when i last looked at itor that its suitable for babieschildren teens adult for the face andbody smooth texture colourless uponapplication no greasy effect no whitetraces a uva of  and i actually gotthat from the shoppers drug mart websitethat its a uva but  fragrance freeparaben free hyper allergenicand moisturizing i purchased this fortwenty seven ninety canadian dollarsthis comes in a hundred mil tube and ipicked this up at shoppers drug martits an all chemical sunscreen and thefilters are one of the main reasons whythis is in my top sunscreen pics of theyear it has  arctic raylene  tinasorb m  april been zone and  tinasorb s weve all heard of australian andavo been zone in western sunscreens butthe fact that it has both tina sorb m s which are very photo stable filtersthat have very good uva protection andthe fact that you could purchase this soeasily over the counter at your localshoppers drug mart or a rec hall isincredible as you can hear this is quitea liquidy sunscreen and it comes in atube packaging and again i dont likethe packaging for as you can see thatbuildup is nasty heres the swatch on myhand as you can see its a bit of like athick lotion type of texture because itis still running down my hand althoughvery slowly now im just gonna rub itinto my hand now as you can see itsvery smooth like this actually doesntfeel thick at all it feels really niceand light its also making my hand feelslightly more moisturize now i didntrub this inwell enough but as you can see there isa slight cast on this hand here comparedto my hand without the sunscreen and imjust gonna rub it in a little bit moreand keep in mind this is still like oninitial application so it doesnt lookask caste now compared to my handwithout it and it actually makes my skinlook more even tone definitely shinieron this side as well but definitely moremoisturized on this hand as forfragrance its not noticeable at allunless you actually actively go likethis and even then i cant describe whatthe scent is its not unpleasant itsnot overly industrial chemicallysmelling i would say there is like maybea slight sour type of smell to it but itdoesnt smell rotten or anything likethat but again its not a noticeablescent at all when i apply it on my facewhen i apply it on my face i actuallytry to apply it in two separate layersand i find by doing this it glides onthe skin it very easily and it feelsnice and light and as you can see oninitial application there looks liketheres a cast going on but as you cansee in the clip  to  minutes laterthe cast subsided and i actually noticedthe undertone in my skin still afterwaiting in the  to  minutes idefinitely noticed my skin looks a lotshinier but it also looks a bit moreeven tone in terms of the feel it almostfeels like i added an extra moisturizeron to my skin but this is definitely notas rich as the bioderma outer dermintensive balm that i use that one isvery rich whereas this one it feels likeit just leaves a nice moisturized layeron top of the skin this hasnt awaterproof claims on the packaging hereit says apply generously prior to sunexposurereapply as needed or after swimmingtowel drying perspiring heavily andwashing for extra skin benefits like imentioned prior in terms of the feel itdoes feel like this adds a little bitextra moisture to my skin but one of thebigger skin benefits ive noticed whenusing this sunscreen is that mypigmentation has faded significantly inmy current skincare routine i am usingazelaic acid and different and i findboth of those in my routine haveactually helped lighten any pigmentationi have on my face but in the summertimei do freckle a lot and actually on thetop part of my cheeks right here i amnoticing some residual pigmentation andfor the women in my family ive noticedthis is the spot right here where theyhave received age spotbut while using this in this some areactually noticed this never darkened atall and i never even got any frecklesand usually all the freckles are aroundmy nose and i havent seen any this yearthis is an uneducated guess but myassumption is because there is somesilicone in this product and it doesmake my skin look smoother and i alsodont find this emphasizes any textureon my skin at all especially my largepores right here and on my forehead ifind that texture never comes to theforefront when i use this foundation ifanything it looks slightly subsided notblurring but subsided in terms of makeupin the summertime what i did was mostlymix a primer with that drunk elephant dbronzy just to give myself a little bitof a tint right now i am wearing thisproduct underneath the foundation i amwearing mac studio sculpt foundation inthe color nc  did nt go in with mytouch of primer i just went in rightaway with the foundation after waitingthe  to  minutes and powdered alittle bit in my tzone and i reallylike how my skin looks right nowi believe i have tried the it cosmeticscc cream with this product as well and inever noticed it disrupting my makeup atall so for the overall pros for thesunscreen first point is the high uvaprotection this is formulated with somehighly sought after photo stable filtersthat is not easily found in the westernmarket especially for those of you thatlive in the us so for those of us thatare canadian or live close to thecanadian border this is very easy to getat a local rexel or shoppers drug martstore also another pro is i find it agreat amount for the price i mean mils for less than  is really goodthey have this product and one of thoselarge spray bottles so i dont know ifthe formula is slightly different fromthis so i was thinking of checking thatout just because it comes in a largeramount i also like that i can use thisboth on my face and body i dont findthis a greasy product at all despite itsmoisturizing effect and another pro isactually that despite it being an allchemical sunscreen this does not stingmy eyes at all one of the biggest consfor this products like i mentioned isthe fact that it can produce a castalthough today it looked like it didntgive me that much of a cast for goodmeasure i still like going in with sometype of complexion makeup product i feellike even with the sheer foundation thecast on this is still fairly easy tocover another con and it kind of dependson what your skin type is like but thisdoesuse quite a bit of shine not just myface on my body as well so for those ofyou that are oily skin and tend to stayaway from shinier products just keep inmind when you use this i would say abetter option for those of you with oilyskin for a high spf and you be aprotecting product is the la rocheposayanthelios lotion not the one thatstinted but the regular one that one isan all chemical filter sunscreen and ifind it does produce a bit more of amatte finish so i think youd like thatbetter than this one overall despite thecast and the shine it gives thissunscreen has been one of my favoritesunscreens to date and youll definitelybe seeing this in my best of beautyskincare edition around up and that isit for this sunscreen sunday i do hopeyou found this video helpful andinformative if you did please be sure
