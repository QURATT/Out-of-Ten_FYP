"all right so i think it's time to take a"
"break from gaming laptops and focus on"
"something that appeals to the masses"
"which is been on light laptops now we've"
"covered some amazing laptops in the"
"category both from amd and intel"
"speaking of amd finding a zen3u series"
"chip is still like a treasure hunt from"
"region to region even though they offer"
"incredible performance and amazing power"
"efficiency intel on the other hand well"
"you can literally just walk into any"
"retail store and pick up a tiger lake"
"laptop right away it's"
"just an unfortunate situation at the"
"moment and clearly intel is at an"
"advantage but anyways"
"today we're taking a look at this this"
"is the thinkpad x1 carbon from lenovo"
"now the thinkbad series has a special"
"place in my heart because i remember the"
"first laptop in the family being a"
"thinkpad uh you know those really chunky"
"ones i can't really remember the exact"
"model name of it but what i do remember"
"is using dialup internet to access the"
"web and sometimes when the trackpad"
"doesn't work i would use the track point"
"and the"
"dedicated left and right buttons to"
"navigate through the ui which i believe"
"was windows 95"
"man those days so the evolution of the"
"thinkpad series is quite remarkable they"
"keep getting thinner and lighter while"
"offering better performance and"
"durability the x1 carbon has been"
"available for years and we're taking a"
"look at their ninth generation offering"
"what they've done here is they brought a"
"few improvements to the table compared"
"to the aegen x1 carbon a lot of which"
"that i love personally"
"so having used the xps 13 the razer book"
"13 the zen book 13 oled and a few other"
"thin light laptops"
"does the x1 carbon give those options a"
"run for its money"
"well let's find out after we take it"
"today's video sponsor come on it's easy"
"you just have to catch them man my"
"reflexes suck today"
"i need more speed have no fear 360 hertz"
"is here with the awesome fast ips panel"
"that will make you get good"
"the pg 259 qnr monitor comes with a"
"regular stand and this awesome rog desk"
"mounting kit to free up some real estate"
"has built-in nvidia reflex latency"
"analyzer to give competitor gamers an"
"accurate measurement of system latency"
"wow and of course it's g-sync equipped"
"to minimize display stutter and input"
"lag get the proper speed to catch all"
"the frames check it out below alright so"
"let's kick things off with pricing and"
"the different spec configurations that"
"you can opt for so the base model starts"
"at a little over 1400 and for that you"
"get a core i5 1135 g7 with four cores"
"and eight threads eight gigabytes of ram"
"that's soldered uh 256 gigabytes of"
"storage intel iris xz graphics and a"
"1200 p ips display the next tier comes"
"with an i7 1165 g7 twice the memory and"
"storage for around 1865. the sample that"
"i have over here comes with the upgraded"
"display option"
"that's 4k and brighter for 2 000"
"and if you want obviously spec this"
"thing out you can get the i7 1185 g7"
"with 32 gigabytes of ram and a terabyte"
"of storage for an extra 400"
"now given that this is a lenovo laptop"
"pricing is certainly not the most"
"consistent factor just because there are"
"many sales going around from a"
"month-to-month basis with huge discounts"
"so you could end up picking one up for a"
"really good deal but then again"
"examining their retail value i've come"
"to realize that it's actually more"
"expensive than the xps 13"
"the razer book 13 and most definitely"
"the zenbook 13 oled so what exactly are"
"you getting for that price well i want"
"to start with the exterior design and"
"the build quality improvements that you"
"get compared to the competition first"
"off this entire chassis is made out of a"
"combination of carbon fiber and"
"magnesium alloy to enhance durability"
"and the thinkpad series goes through a"
"bunch of tests and it results in being"
"able to withstand extreme temperatures"
"mechanical shocks vibrations and a whole"
"lot more in fact the limbo has a whole"
"explainer series talking about their"
"durability aspect of the thinkpad series"
"which is certainly worth reading up it's"
"built really well and you can sort of"
"feel that the moment you unbox this"
"thing the only thing to watch out for is"
"wear and tear over time because this"
"material especially with the palm rest"
"and obviously a carbon fiber finish is"
"that it picks up finger oil easily so"
"you'll have to make sure to clean this"
"every now and then to maintain its"
"aesthetics speaking of which i really"
"like it it's an all-black chassis with"
"the thinkpad logo tucked away in the"
"corner with the red led that indicates"
"the power state the hinge is really"
"smooth and you can open it with one hand"
"it's a new single hinge design which is"
"an upgrade from previous years and it"
"barely exhibits any wobbles so that's"
"great news for anyone who loves to type"
"with the laptops on their laps as for"
"size keep in mind that this has a 14"
"inch display so it's a little bit bigger"
"than my xps 13 and even the razer book"
"13. it's still very thin coming in at"
"0.59 inches or 14.9 millimeters and"
"given the carbon fiber and magnesium"
"alloy construction it only weighs around"
"2.5 pounds which is the lightest thinner"
"light laptop that i've ever come across"
"at least here in the studio so great"
"stuff lenovo the power adapter is also"
"extremely compact it's a watt charger"
"and it charges a laptop via usb type-c"
"and interestingly this thing has rapid"
"charge which juices up the laptop from"
"zero to 80"
"in just about an hour"
"that's actually amazing for people who"
"travel a lot let alone professionals who"
"work most their time away from their"
"workstations"
"i just really hope other laptop"
"manufacturers"
"implement something like this with their"
"devices moving forward the interior"
"space is very similar compared to last"
"gen you get the standard layout with the"
"well-known track point right at the"
"center along with its own dedicated"
"primary left and right buttons if you"
"pay close attention to the function keys"
"you'll notice that they've implemented"
"communication commands that can be"
"linked up to skype and microsoft teams"
"the function and control keys are"
"positioned differently but that's a"
"thinkpot hallmark so if you really find"
"that annoying you can just go into"
"vantage and switch that up which is"
"definitely a nice"
"option that they offer"
"the power button also acts as a"
"fingerprint reader and it works really"
"well there's also a separate chip inside"
"that stores the data and of course you"
"also have an ir camera with windows"
"hello support for a simplified and"
"secure login experience the keys"
"themselves are amazing guys i've wanted"
"to try one of these for a while because"
"it's been the gold standard for years"
"and"
"the travel distance is great it gives"
"you a very satisfying feel when you"
"compose sentences"
"on top of that it's also spill resistant"
"which is a huge bonus"
"i'm actually going to let mike chime in"
"on his experience compared to his older"
"6th gen x1 carbon because he actually"
"noticed a few interesting observations"
"so that's definitely worth on mentioning"
"or worth watching they made the trackpad"
"slightly wider and given that it has a"
"glass surface navigating within windows"
"was just a breeze it's actually a very"
"similar experience compared to the xps"
"13. i also have to mention that the"
"integrated left and right buttons are"
"excellent in fact it's tactile but at"
"the same time also mushy it's"
"one of the best things that i've"
"experienced on a laptop i think i'm"
"going to do a quick sound test just to"
"give you guys a quick idea or just a"
"rough idea on how this thing feels"
"taking a look at the i o i'm actually"
"impressed with what the thinkpad offers"
"considering its low profile design so on"
"the left hand side you get a few"
"thunderbolt 4 ports a usb type a 3.2 gen"
"1 port an hdmi 2.0 port switching over"
"to the right hand side there's"
"kensington lock another usb type a 3.2"
"gen 1 port and a headphone jack i'm"
"actually a little disappointed that they"
"didn't include usb 3.2 gen 2 ports"
"because they have twice the bandwidth"
"compared to gen 1. um it could be a"
"design limitation but it's still weird"
"to see on laptop that costs"
"so much money moving on to the display"
"and one of the biggest upgrades from gen"
"8 to gen 9 is the inclusion of a 16 by"
"10 screen which gives you more vertical"
"screen real estate so you can have more"
"content filling up your screen i have"
"the uhd plus 60hz non-touch variant and"
"it is an excellent panel with beautiful"
"color reproduction it's an ips panel and"
"it covers 100 srgb 91 adobe rgb and 99"
"dcip3 that's oled level guys which is"
"amazing and on top of that it gets super"
"bright our sample goes as far as 514"
"hits so whether if you're a professional"
"photographer or just someone who works"
"on presentations for your company"
"you're seriously in for a treat my only"
"issue though is it's a glossy finish and"
"lenovo hasn't added any anti-reflective"
"coating to cut down the reflections plus"
"this panel doesn't have the privacy"
"guard feature that disables the view"
"angle from both left and right to"
"protect the content on the screen you"
"only get that feature with the"
"1200pm matte display option which is 500"
"nits so just keep that in mind"
"but also another thing to note is that"
"those panels take a slight hit on the"
"color gamut so what i'm going to do"
"right now is let mike chime in with his"
"thoughts on the new x1 carbon so take it"
"away man all right guys eber asked me to"
"jump in front of the camera here because"
"i am a die hard thinkpad user i've been"
"using actually this little guy right"
"over here the thinkpad x1 carbon 6 gen"
"for the last three years and it's been"
"through hell it's been through"
"rainstorms in taiwan it's been lost in"
"vegas it's basically been through"
"everything but it's still going and i"
"absolutely love it but like a lot of"
"thinkpad users i don't want there to be"
"any changes"
"to the thinkpad unless it's absolutely"
"necessary so what are my thoughts about"
"this x1 carbon and i've been using this"
"for about a week for the most part the"
"changes that have been made"
"intergenerationally they've been for the"
"better for example that 16x10 screen"
"that they're now using from a"
"productivity standpoint it's a huge"
"upgrade now the funny thing for me is"
"that"
"going to that 16x10 screen i didn't"
"actually realize what i was getting but"
"when i stepped back to my old thinkpad"
"that's what i realized what i was losing"
"on the other hand i really have to"
"appreciate the fact that they've"
"upgraded the finish on it mine you can"
"see the fingerprints and the shmu on"
"there from a mile and a half away the"
"new one it still gets marked up quite a"
"bit but at the same time it doesn't show"
"quite as much of the junk as the older"
"one the other thing that they really did"
"upgrade or what i think is a downgrade"
"is the keyboard that thinkpad keyboard"
"has always been legendary"
"mine i love the throw distance i love"
"the fact that there's a little bit of"
"tactile feedback it just feels right"
"the new one it's really hard to describe"
"this and i'm going to struggle with"
"words here a little bit but it almost"
"feels like they pulled a little bit of"
"the life out of that older thinkpad"
"keyboard in order to make it maybe a"
"little bit more low profile in order to"
"fit upgraded components inside other"
"than that the port selection is the same"
"so you don't need to go to dongle life"
"like you do with the xps 13 for example"
"lenovo kept all of the ports that were"
"there and upgraded the ones that needed"
"to be upgraded the last thing i wanted"
"to mention is the webcam because"
"something that i noticed again and again"
"and again over the conference calls that"
"i had in the last week or so so let's"
"get to that well guys this is the webcam"
"test on the sixth generation x1 carbon"
"and as you can see it's a three-year-old"
"laptop webcam there's looks like there's"
"vaseline smeared over my face there's a"
"lot of noise going around and auto"
"exposure even though auto exposure is"
"off it looks like it's still on by all"
"of this flickering going on in the"
"screen now i'm going to switch over to"
"the new x1 carbon to really really hope"
"that it looks a lot better than this one"
"and welcome to the ninth generation"
"thinkpad x1 carbon and what can i say"
"oh my god i in some ways it has actually"
"gotten worse than three years ago so"
"first of all there's this odd sharpening"
"going on and yes i don't look like i was"
"smeared with vaseline except now i look"
"like i have craters all over my face or"
"something not only that is that the"
"colors are so subdued it to me it really"
"really doesn't look good even looking at"
"in this screen right now it almost looks"
"black and white i'm wondering if the"
"actual recording is going to be like"
"that other than that i mean luckily auto"
"exposure turns itself off completely now"
"so you can really balance that one way"
"or another but otherwise"
"i really want to know what you guys"
"think about this to me"
"it's a disappointment there's a"
"professional device and yes you're going"
"to be seen on on zoom calls so a little"
"little talking head down there but"
"how is it looking like this and"
"what i've done here is i've gone through"
"the settings to do the best possible"
"capture and this is it guys"
"what do you think so"
"yeah that webcam test didn't go as well"
"as we thought it would but hey on the"
"positive side they've implemented dual"
"front-facing speakers with this"
"generation and it sounds amazing there"
"is good clarity in the high end and the"
"bass response is respectable to be"
"honest i didn't expect this from a"
"thinkpad but"
"i'm going to take it anyway guys"
"upgradability is pretty limited on the"
"x1 carbon the memory is soldered onto"
"the pcb and the primary nvme ssd is"
"right over here and the drive speeds are"
"really fast specifically with reads"
"however the right performance is average"
"there is a wlan slot which adopts the"
"m.2 interface but it's strictly meant"
"for networking cards i tried to install"
"my toshiba rc100 ssd but the bios"
"refused it"
"now i'm aware that some gen 6 laptops"
"can take secondary drives but with the"
"gen 9"
"i'm not really sure guys but anyways"
"let's talk about battery life because"
"this thing has a 4k screen which to be"
"honest is pointless in a 14-inch form"
"factor but we were just interested to"
"see how it stacks up with the other thin"
"and laptops that we've tested"
"and"
"well first of all if you want the best"
"battery life absolutely avoid the 4k"
"screen and maybe even think about"
"grabbing the i5 instead of the i7 our"
"sample has"
"but even with those two things working"
"against it the x1 carbon actually gets"
"some reasonable numbers at almost 13"
"hours in the light load test remember"
"that other than the dell xps 13 all the"
"other competitors here have either"
"smaller screens or lower resolutions so"
"with that in mind this is actually"
"pretty impressive and it makes me wonder"
"if the 1200p model would come closer to"
"these zenbook numbers under a heavier"
"load well there's nothing to complain"
"about here either with the x1 posting"
"the longest battery life of any thin and"
"light tiger lake laptop we've seen so"
"far i mean look this class of thingpad"
"isn't meant for running multi-core loads"
"while being unplugged but if you need to"
"well at least you won't have to find an"
"outlet every hour but this all leads to"
"something pretty interesting about this"
"laptop and that's its performance mode"
"you see lenovo has always targeted the"
"carbon series at professionals who just"
"want to plug in their laptop and start"
"using it day in and day out with minimum"
"amount of fuss so that means no fiddling"
"around with settings or bloatware and"
"most of all"
"nothing that takes away from"
"productivity time anyways that led them"
"to create a really straightforward power"
"plan where the modes are switched"
"through the standard windows power"
"manager in your taskbar there are two"
"auto modes that allow the system to"
"manage surface temperatures cpu speeds"
"and noise while favoring either a"
"balanced approach or"
"a more performance area there's also a"
"manual performance mode that simply"
"allows the processor to run at higher"
"speeds for longer periods of time you"
"can actually see this quite well with"
"both performance and auto performance"
"delivering really similar power input"
"right up until the four-minute mark of"
"our test"
"then the algorithm lenovo uses in auto"
"mode dials things back to between 12 and"
"15 watts until surface temperatures are"
"reduced and then it kicks things up"
"again"
"meanwhile performance mode simply runs"
"at 23 watts all day"
"auto balance on the other hand"
"well i'm not sure if you want to be"
"running this for any intensive tasks"
"since it limits the processor to just 7"
"watts that's perfect for most the folks"
"who are looking at the x1 but it's"
"terrible for anything other than a light"
"workload you can actually see what"
"happens with clock speeds when those"
"three modes are being used balanced"
"barely sticks above one gigahertz while"
"the other two performance modes offer"
"more than double the amount of speed and"
"honestly if you're in a pension trying"
"to render out a file or get a bit of"
"extra transcoding work done ditching out"
"the out-of-the-box balance mode is the"
"only thing to do that all translates"
"into auto performance and performance"
"hitting just above 95 degrees for"
"shorter amounts of time before the fans"
"pick up a bit of steam and draws things"
"down to a lot more reasonable levels"
"but you can still see how the automatic"
"setting gets quite aggressive for a few"
"minutes before letting its foot off the"
"gas and it lets temperatures spike again"
"it does that over and over again when"
"you look at balance well it's what you"
"probably expected it's cool and really"
"well behaved right across the board"
"barely reaching above 50 degrees"
"but good news about all of this is"
"regardless of whatever mode you're in"
"the thinkpad x1 carbon is one of the"
"quietest machines out here for the"
"professionals and even students who buy"
"these things that's pretty important"
"since the last thing anyone wants is for"
"a meeting to be interrupted by a loud"
"laptop and even when running at full"
"tilt surface temperatures are well"
"managed which means working with it on"
"your lap in the airport or in a"
"classroom setting shouldn't really pose"
"any problems there is a small hotspot on"
"the back but it's focused in an area"
"that doesn't usually come in contact"
"with your body now moving on to real"
"world benchmarks in the auto performance"
"mode and the results here are pretty"
"much in line with what we've come to"
"expect from the i7 1165 g7 in a thin and"
"light laptop it'll lose to the amd cpus"
"and multi-threaded benchmarks since they"
"have double the number of processing"
"threads"
"one of the other challenges here is auto"
"performance mode doesn't run at a"
"constant speed so the results tend to"
"vary a lot but at the same time it gives"
"excellent performance in areas where the"
"x1 carbon is likely going to be used"
"most of the time and that's likely"
"thread situations like word processing"
"spreadsheets exports and pdf creation"
"the premiere results need a bit of an"
"explanation here because they're almost"
"too good to be true basically what's"
"happening here is lenovo's doing app"
"detection in the auto performance mode"
"we're using so in this situation the xe"
"graphics gets a bit more juice and"
"operates at about 225 megahertz since"
"premiere is gpu bound that little extra"
"bit of performance makes a big"
"difference in longer renders like this"
"one now taking a look at gaming"
"performance"
"this is obviously not something that"
"people find themselves using the x1 for"
"but still i know for a fact that when we"
"used to travel to shows"
"mike played civ on his carbon during"
"longer flights i mean it's a great way"
"to pass time and with the iris xc"
"graphics this generation is actually"
"able to play most basic titles at some"
"pretty decent frame rates unless you get"
"into one of those situations where"
"intel's drivers end up crashing most of"
"the time i've got to say this is one"
"area where amd really needs to step"
"things up because their vega"
"architecture is really really starting"
"to show its age on the laptop side of"
"things so final thoughts on the x1"
"carbon gen 9 from lenovo and guys i'm"
"seriously impressed with this laptop the"
"first thing that comes to my mind is"
"just how lightweight it is while being"
"extremely durable the 16x10 screen is"
"gorgeous and it's really bright um the"
"keyboard is still best in class battery"
"life is also pretty good but i would"
"honestly pick up the 1200p option if you"
"want to get a little bit more life out"
"of this thing"
"the performance is also quite nice as"
"well and most importantly it's one of"
"the quietest laptops that we've tested"
"under heavier load situations now if you"
"look at the price situation it is"
"expensive but what you're really paying"
"for is something that's going to last"
"you for years to come ahead"
"and"
"you also get the enhanced security"
"features like a privacy switch an ir"
"camera lenovo self healing bios a dtpm"
"chip that encrypts user data"
"now with the average consumer care about"
"those things"
"probably not in fact it's really geared"
"towards professionals or people who work"
"in the corporate side where they deal"
"with classified information"
"and i think most likely you might just"
"end up getting one of these through work"
"instead of paying out of your own pocket"
"personally i would pick this over the"
"xps 13 just because it got it's got more"
"ports and"
"it's matte black which is my vibe and oh"
"if you do find it on sale"
"and if it fits your budget i would"
"definitely pick this up without even"
"thinking for a second so"
"on that note"
"thank you so much for watching i hope"
"you were able to take away everything"
"that you needed to know about the x1"
"carbon from lenovo let me know what you"
"guys think about this little thing"
"because"
"um"
"this is my first thinkpad laptop in a"
"while um and i'm seriously impressed"
"i kind of wish i"
"i think i might switch from the xps 13"
"but i have to send this back so"
"yeah"
"anyways"
"that's for me guys"
"oh and don't forget to spend responsibly"
"Introducing Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10."
"With its enhanced, air-intake keyboard and 110 mm glass touchpad, 2.8k OLED and WQUXGA Touch display options."
"The X1 Carbon has the new Intel 12 gen U15/P28 CPUs with 20W design and 32GB of memory – this is where beauty meets performance."
"And with 5G and Wifi 6E the X1 Carbon has the industry’s best connectivity."
"The X1 Carbon also comes with new FHD cameras, housed in a communications bar with optional computer vision."
"The improved camera experience, combined with Dolby Voice and eyesafe certified low blue light displays, gives hybrid work a whole new elevated experience."
"so this is the lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon"
"9th gen very long name but a very"
"popular laptop in the business world and"
"i was going to straight up review this"
"by itself but i reviewed the x1 nano"
"about a week ago and this compared to"
"that"
"it makes a lot of sense like these two"
"laptops are so similar in a ton of ways"
"they both have that thinkpad look and"
"feel and the price is different one is"
"700 cheaper than the other so you might"
"be asking yourself if you need to pay"
"extra or not by the end of this video"
"if you look at them you can see the same"
"kind of design philosophy they're both"
"mil std tested they can withstand spills"
"on the keyboard"
"they're they're really light 2.15 pounds"
"for the nano compared to 2.49"
"on the carbon if you're holding them you"
"can feel the difference but quite"
"frankly 2.49 pounds is so light to begin"
"with that i think most people won't"
"complain about the weight but the nano"
"is meant for for hardcore travel"
"warriors right you're trying to pack as"
"light as possible and that's what the"
"nano is for because even though it's"
"lighter it's just a smaller laptop like"
"when you put it on top of the carbon you"
"can see that the laptop is not as deep"
"and not as wide now this is the black"
"model but you can also get the nano with"
"a weave and the black model tends to"
"show fingerprints a lot easier compared"
"to the weave which shows it too but it's"
"not as drastic now the one thing you're"
"giving up with the nano is ports you"
"only get two thunderbolt 4 ports on the"
"left-hand side so for some of you out"
"there that might mean carrying dongles"
"with you the carbon on the other hand"
"has all the ports you can think of two"
"thunderbolt 4 you have your usb port"
"full-size hdmi and then when you flip it"
"to the other side you have another usb"
"port and your headphone jack the other"
"big difference is the keyboard deck"
"there's just a lot more space to work"
"with on the carbon the nano is just a"
"little bit more cramped due to its"
"smaller form factor the typing"
"experience is identical i didn't find"
"typing on one easier over the other but"
"the touch pad is the main difference"
"like you just get a lot more space to"
"move your fingers around on the carbon"
"but here's the funny thing even though"
"you get more space on the carbon i found"
"the touchpad on the nano to be a lot"
"more enjoyable to use one thing i found"
"about lenovo thinkpads in general is"
"that the consistency of the touchpads"
"vary from unit to unit it's never"
"exactly the same some just happen to be"
"a bit better is it a big deal is it"
"drastic is it going to ruin the way you"
"use your laptop absolutely not just"
"something i noticed after years and"
"years of reviewing think pads the other"
"thing is the fingerprint scanner this is"
"right beside the touch pad on the nano"
"whereas on the carbon it's embedded into"
"the power button speakers are both on"
"top of the deck but you have more"
"speakers with the carbon and therefore"
"you do get better sound just because"
"there's more room to work with"
"[Applause]"
"[Music]"
"[Applause]"
"now both of these laptops can have your"
"screen flipped 180 degrees they both"
"support windows hello and they both have"
"720p webcams the webcams are nothing"
"special but they're there the other"
"thing to note is lenovo's smart presence"
"technology so when you approach any of"
"these laptops it detects that you're"
"there and then scans your face and logs"
"you in the moment you go away from the"
"laptop it will detect that you left and"
"automatically lock your screen in case"
"you forgot to"
"the displays are a bit different they're"
"they're both 16 by 10. the difference is"
"that this one happens to be 14 inches"
"and this is 13. quite frankly i feel"
"like i'm working on a bigger display"
"than a 13 inch display because of that"
"aspect ratio and same holds true for the"
"bigger carbon the difference in color"
"accuracy really comes down to the skew"
"that you decide to buy like this one you"
"can buy it with a 1900 or 1920x1200"
"display but this one happens to be 4k"
"and you're just getting a lot more"
"brightness more color gamut to work with"
"if you're really into design this"
"doesn't have such a crazy color gamut"
"compared to the carbon but it's still"
"really good and the fact that this one's"
"matte gives you less reflection if"
"you're outdoors a lot now they did a"
"pretty good job of reducing the"
"reflection on this glossy display and"
"it's significantly less than let's say"
"the surface laptop but again because you"
"have a glossy display there's going to"
"be a bit of reflection now both of these"
"laptops are using an i7 processor and"
"they're both 11th gen but there is a"
"difference one is using a 116 zero g7"
"and the other is a one one six five g"
"seven thank you intel for making this"
"very confusing what the zero g7 means is"
"that the x1 nano is using a lower tdp of"
"that i7 processor this one is like a 15"
"watt processor whereas this one can go"
"up to 30 watts which means the carbon is"
"technically going to give you better"
"performance the funny thing though is"
"all the tests i ran the carbon did"
"perform better but it wasn't like"
"drastic you know like take this mozilla"
"compile time yes it compiled faster on"
"the carbon but it wasn't by much"
"if you're an editor or a designer and"
"you're buying these for photoshop and"
"you're doing meetings and stuff like"
"that again the carbon is going to be the"
"better option but it's not drastic and"
"if you're a video editor looking for"
"something light and portable these are"
"not it you usually want something with a"
"dedicated gpu but the beauty of using an"
"intel laptop with that iris xe graphics"
"chip and quick sync if you're using"
"adobe premiere pro you can still edit a"
"video like you can still"
"do it i just don't recommend doing it"
"all the time and again it's going to be"
"faster on the carbon the other thing to"
"note is that these things"
"can be pushed harder but lenovo aiming"
"these laptops towards business users"
"want to make sure the fan noise is low"
"that's why when these things are under"
"full load you can hear the fans but"
"they're not loud around like 43 decibels"
"heat management is also going to be good"
"because the fan noise needs to stay low"
"so they're going to power limit the cpu"
"so that the the heat doesn't get too hot"
"and the fans don't get too loud"
"internally the only thing that is"
"upgradable is the nvme ssd the ram is"
"completely soldered onto the motherboard"
"the other difference is the fan layout"
"you get one big fan with the nano which"
"makes sense considering this is a 15"
"watt"
"cpu you don't really need two for it and"
"on the carbon you have two fans since it"
"has a higher tdp the other thing to note"
"is the drive setup this is using a 2280"
"nvme ssd and nets you've higher read and"
"write speeds the smaller nvme ssd inside"
"of here is still fast but not as fast as"
"the carbon the battery is bigger in the"
"carbon 57 watt hours compared to 47 but"
"here's the thing i actually got better"
"battery life on the x1 nano probably"
"most likely due to the fact that this is"
"not using a 4k display and this is a 13"
"inch display instead of 14 inches so"
"here's the thing on paper the carbon 9th"
"gen makes more sense you're getting a"
"slightly faster computer you're getting"
"more ports to work with you're getting a"
"better sound you're getting a bigger"
"keyboard deck a much bigger touchpad to"
"work with and you're getting the option"
"of a bigger display but it costs"
"anywhere from five to seven hundred"
"dollars more if you go with the 4k model"
"over the x1 nano and if the performance"
"was significantly better then i would"
"say it might be worth it but the"
"performance difference between both of"
"these guys are not that drastic and the"
"x1 nano is already getting you 90 to 95"
"percent there i didn't find like i was"
"missing much when i was using the x1"
"nano like i didn't find like i needed to"
"go back to the carbon and if you're an"
"i.t administrator who's going from"
"office or to office or will be in the"
"near future"
"then i think you're going to have a lot"
"more fun with the nano because most"
"people buying these business laptops"
"they're not like doing 3d work and"
"compiling code for 10 hours straight"
"they're using excel they're writing"
"documents they're remoting into their"
"company's infrastructure to manage it"
"and i think with the better battery life"
"on the nano you might find this to be"
"the better option now if you're"
"interested in picking any of these guys"
"up there'll be links to it in the"
"description down below if you have any"
"more questions let me know like the"
"video if you liked it subscribe if you"
"haven't already and i'll see you guys in"
"the next one"
"This is the coolest laptop I've ever used."
"Sadly, it's also one of the most disappointing."
"(upbeat music)"
"Let's review."
"The last time you saw the Lenovo X1 Fold on this channel,"
"I used it to explore all the ways a folding screen"
"changed the way I used a laptop."
"Now that term, laptop, is important because"
"some folks have called this a tablet,"
"and sure, it can be used that way."
"But at 2.2 pounds, it's really too clunky for that label."
"Where this machine finds full expression"
"is when you treat it like a PC."
"With a built in kickstand, it deploys to a 13.3 inch"
"easel with detached keyboard on a desktop,"
"collapses to a kind of cyber throwback Netbook for travel,"
"and finally, folds into the footprint of a hardback novel"
"when you need to pack it away."
"Now because of that novel nature of folding screens,"
"you might think that the problems I'd found"
"arise from that flexibility."
"But not at all."
"In fact, Lenovo's hardware is frankly inspired."
"In the almost two year run up to its release,"
"the company was incredibly open to sharing"
"how much work went into building a machine"
"that earns its Thinkpad name."
"That's the company's business brand of laptops,"
"generally held to a higher standard of reliability"
"because they're aimed at the enterprise."
"One of my favorite things from CES 2020"
"was Lenovo having brought an exploded model"
"of the X1 Fold for the press to poke and prod,"
"which we certainly did."
"I've twisted the hinges, I've stabbed the screen"
"and by now I've used the assembled device"
"on and off for about two months."
"I wasn't sure anyone could realize the dream"
"of a folding screen PC solid enough to stand up"
"to everyday use, but the X1 Fold does it."
"The leather back evokes the premium feel"
"of an old journal, while the stacked Netbook mode"
"means you can still work under cramped conditions."
"And over the two months I've used it,"
"there's been none of the loosening or creaking"
"or creasing you might expect."
"The only hardware quibbles I do have are the"
"Chassis being a little more reluctant to fold fully flat,"
"resulting in a very slight angle when open,"
"and an oil slick-like reflectivity of the screen"
"under certain lighting when powered off."
"Incidentally I've seen both of those characteristics"
"on the Motorola Razor as well,"
"so maybe these are just typical attributes of"
"whatever flexible screen LG display provided here."
"Those characteristics don't materially affect"
"everyday use."
"I'm more annoyed by the thin, tinny speakers"
"than I am anything to do with the folding screen."
"But while the foldable form factor may not be"
"the root of the machine's problems,"
"those problems do start with a byproduct"
"of its foldable nature."
"See, in order to offer full functionality"
"and its various postures,"
"the X1 Fold needs a detachable keyboard."
"On paper, it's quite clever."
"Has a Bluetooth keyboard, it works whether"
"it's attached or not."
"When it does attach, it does so magnetically"
"and it even charges while it's on there,"
"fitting perfectly inside the gap between"
"the screens' halves."
"I even got used to the compromises that were made"
"in the name of miniaturization."
"The enter key that I hit instead of the"
"apostrophe a hundred times,"
"the fact that typing a question mark means holding down"
"not just the function key, but the function"
"and the shift keys."
"But I never got used to every 30th word"
"sprouting extra letters."
"A problem that, to be fair, I've experienced on"
"other Bluetooth keyboards going all the way back"
"to the Pixel C."
"Look at this, every double letter you see here is genuine."
"I didn't force any errors for effect."
"It's not a problem with the keyboard itself,"
"since the doubling kept right on happening"
"even when I paired this thing with the"
"quirky writer I keep around for when I want"
"no one to take me seriously at the coffee shop."
"And I did have better luck when I stuck to netbook mode"
"with the keyboard resting right on the device."
"But that bundled keyboard has other problems."
"A terrible tiny track pad that's finicky"
"and prone to cursor drift."
"There are no rubber feet on the keyboard"
"so it wanders all over the place if you type on"
"a slippery table top."
"Whatever material the keys are made of,"
"it's so soft that it starts showing wear"
"after just two days of use."
"And to top it all off, there's no back light,"
"so if you're trying to type in a darkened plane"
"or train cabin, good luck with that."
"When I put all these problems to Lenovo,"
"the company sent me a replacement for the retail device"
"I had purchased, which I really appreciated."
"Sadly though, that swap didn't fix any of my problems"
"and in fact, it brought to light a whole new set of them."
"When I tried resetting the first machine,"
"that reset failed, and without a physical keyboard"
"I couldn't resolve the issue."
"Then a few weeks after I first set it up,"
"I powered up the replacement X1 Fold"
"to find that it had forgotten the date and time."
"Now, I was able to fix that in the bios,"
"but then the device put itself into what looked like"
"some kind of update loop which lasted until"
"the battery ran out."
"Only after an overnight charge and an automated"
"Windows repair did it start working again, kinda."
"Now if you're thinking, hey, you know,"
"this just doesn't seem like a device that's a great match"
"for Windows 10, you know I think you're onto something."
"This isn't a secret."
"From the very first time I saw the X1 Fold Prototype,"
"it was clear that it was not built for any version"
"of Windows that we had yet seen."
"The Windows 10 operating system is not planned"
"for the final product."
"But rather for the sleeker, Chrome OS competitor"
"that came to be called Windows 10X."
"10X was intended to serve as the launch platform"
"for Microsoft's new Surface Neo device,"
"but when 10X got delayed, the Neo did too."
"Not so for Lenovo."
"The X1 Fold launched almost on time at the tail end of 2020"
"with Windows 10 Home and Pro, instead of X as options."
"And the result, well, (buzzer)"
"That's what happens when the Spotify web player"
"and X1 Fold decide to disagree about whether or not"
"the device should go to sleep."
"And that's just the start of it."
"A few times a week I'll wake up the machine"
"to find that it thinks it's in landscape or portrait mode"
"when it's really just the opposite."
"That's part of why Lenovo made its own mode switcher"
"to help you switch orientations,"
"but it doesn't always work,"
"so you need to restart sometimes to get it oriented right."
"At one point while ""wroting this revie the lay board"
"just stopped wrpling because Bluetooth stopped wrpling."""
"Which meant I had to switch over to the built-in"
"Windows software lay board and its inconsistent autocorrect."
"The other limitations aren't really bugs,"
"so much as symptoms of a system design that's"
"very specific."
"While it's responsive enough for typical browsing"
"and office tasks, this Lakefield Core i5 cpu"
"doesn't pack any of the newer niceties"
"Intel included with its Evo line."
"Like the rapid wakeup and better battery management"
"I talked about on my Asus Zenbook Duo 14 review."
"That platform or maybe even Qualcomm's"
"Always Connected PC Snapdragon would've been"
"a perfect fit for a device like this."
"As it stands now, the X1 Fold is often slow to wake,"
"and if I'm using it in easel mode with the full screen,"
"I generally get fewer than four hours of constant use"
"on a full charge."
"Judging from other reviews battery tests,"
"it seems I would get better endurance"
"if I didn't have to run the screen at max brightness"
"almost all the time."
"But it's top line output of 300 nits just isn't"
"bright enough for a machine that's supposed to come with me"
"everywhere I go."
"And I want to take the X1 Fold everywhere I go."
"I was the kid who watched way too much Inspector Gadget"
"and ruins scores of library books by sketching"
"Penny's computer book into their back pages."
"So I've been waiting for that computer book for 30 years."
"Today, I like to think of myself as"
"YouTube's biggest champion of folding screen technology."
"And seeing a panel this crisp and durable,"
"one you can even use a pen on without damaging it,"
"it's otherworldly."
"I know I glossed over tablet mode,"
"but if you're an artist or a designer with a good use"
"for this Wacom enabled stylus, this would be next level."
"Factor in the revival of cyber punks style"
"that makes this kinda retro look cool again,"
"this thing could be incredible."
"Unfortunately for a starting price this high"
"and a bug list this long,"
"the only thing incredible about it is how badly it's been"
"hobbled by shipping with a half baked"
"and badly implemented form of the wrong OS."
"Man, I'm sorry, but you can max out a"
"Microsoft Surface Go 2, toss in a keyboard mouse and a pen"
"and still save a thousand dollars."
"If it ever gets a build of Windows 10X,"
"I'll be first in line to reevaluate,"
"but until then, I can't recommend it."
"And given the caliber of this hardware"
"and the potential of the concept,"
"that's something I'm genuinely sad to say."
"If you wanna learn more about Windows 10x,"
"check out the excellent reporting by comrades"
"at Windows Central."
"Link below alongside some other reviews of the X1 Fold"
"I think you'll find helpful."
"This review is produced following 60 days"
"with a retail X1 Fold purchased by Mr. Mobile"
"and a review sample sent by Lenovo."
"As always, and obviously in this case,"
"Lenovo didn't pay for this coverage."
"The opinions herein are mine and mine alone."
"Until next time, thanks for watching."
"And if you can't stay home, remember to stay safe"
"and mask up while you stay mobile, my friends."
"ed here with the digital digest and"
"today i wanted to share a quick unboxing"
"and first look at the lenovo thinkpad x1"
"carbon gen 10. now this just arrived"
"from lenovo for review purposes it"
"starts at roughly 1400 us dollars and"
"change i'll include a link in the"
"description and believe it or not some"
"units are already shipping out so let's"
"get this out of the box i'll talk about"
"what's new uh for 20 2022 with the"
"gen 10 version"
"most importantly we now have uh brand"
"new of course intel 12th gen processors"
"uh in this build we've got"
"the"
"1260p that is a core i7"
"which should give i would say really"
"improved overall"
"processor performance from the previous"
"generation"
"that's one of the big differences this"
"year and then in addition to that"
"we've also got lpddr5 ram"
"which is soldered to the board so keep"
"that in mind when you're looking at"
"different"
"pre-configurations of this machine"
"make sure that you get the ram"
"amount that you actually need"
"and beyond that it looks like"
"we've got a little bit of paperwork in"
"here that i'm grabbing"
"everything seems to be recycled"
"packaging which"
"nothing wrong with that that's a good"
"thing and yeah all your paperwork"
"now"
"we do have of course facial recognition"
"for those of you that are wondering for"
"windows hello"
"security purposes but let's get to the"
"laptop itself two and a half pounds and"
"that's part of the beauty of what"
"really is promised to be an incredibly"
"uh lightweight durable ultra book that"
"has basically a little bit of everything"
"including touch screen"
"now"
"new for 2022"
"besides that"
"brand new processor"
"and of course the ddr5 ram remember"
"soldered to the board"
"we also have a full hd webcam so that's"
"an upgrade a little bit it seems of"
"design changes nothing too crazy"
"we have also in addition to that a gen 4"
"nvme ssd drive"
"for those of you that are wondering"
"that is yet another uh nice addition"
"they've also reconfigured cooling uh"
"this is a 65 watt charger no surprise"
"there"
"so"
"i think this is going to be a popular"
"machine granted i haven't even powered"
"it on i mean"
"from an aesthetic standpoint it's really"
"nice matte display again 14 inches"
"we do have a privacy switch on that full"
"hd webcam uh fingerprint scanner right"
"here i like that the display is matte"
"i'm powering this up"
"but as it does boot hdmi"
"2.0 i think it's a b"
"of course usb type a i think this is a"
"3.2 gen 1. and then we have two"
"thunderbolt 4 ports which is great of"
"course that's how you're going to also"
"charge the machine you can see it's"
"booting up right now on the other side"
"headphone uh combo jack and then of"
"course that"
"yet another"
"still important uh usb type a port and a"
"kensington lock"
"build quality on this"
"is excellent just as it was with the"
"previous generation it's going to be"
"really difficult to"
"i think beat the overall aesthetic the"
"whole package the cpu"
"and"
"again overall performance that will"
"likely"
"not yield amazing battery life but let's"
"see you know if this gets between 8 and"
"10 hours i don't think that that's bad"
"the oled display option uh besides the"
"cpu itself i think is one of the most"
"important new elements to this machine"
"now this is a 16 by 10 aspect ratio ips"
"panel"
"but"
"and again full hd plus that means"
"by 1200 res but you can spec this out"
"with a 2.2 k oled option this does"
"promise"
"very good color fidelity and from what i"
"can see right now it looks really good"
"but the question will be"
"you know how does that oled perform in"
"all likelihood it's going to be"
"excellent"
"so that's something to be aware of and"
"of course this does carry intel evo"
"certification um"
"the processor is"
"i believe that it's a v pro certified so"
"i just you know a lot of nice things"
"going on here your classic"
"thinkpad keyboard"
"you've got the nub in the event you need"
"it you've got of course"
"a standard i would say pretty much"
"standard thinkpad"
"trackpad and then you still have of"
"course the good old left and right click"
"for when you're using the nub or even"
"for those of you who just don't want to"
"use the trackpad to actually make"
"selections you've got flexibility now"
"you can also"
"get 5g or 4g radios on this so that's"
"another thing when customization comes"
"down to it but just remember you're"
"going to want to flex this thing on ram"
"because of it being soldered the nvme"
"drive you can upgrade yourself uh for"
"those of you that are wondering i"
"believe this came with a one terabyte"
"again gen 4 drive but i'll be testing it"
"out putting it through the paces let's"
"just go ahead and jump on the internet"
"for a second"
"and just see what that's like"
"and"
"you know having touchscreen on something"
"this size and"
"uh the fact that it does go 180 degrees"
"this is going to be a popular machine"
"just like the previous generation"
"especially now with that more powerful"
"processor can they ever get it to be"
"more efficient i don't know but it's"
"definitely more powerful anyone who"
"tells you otherwise well"
"they haven't played with the 1260p so"
"getting onto wi-fi here as i said let's"
"do that"
"jumping on right now i also like all of"
"the keys that we have"
"the dedicated keys at the top always a"
"nice touch not everybody loves it but i"
"am a fan"
"and"
"i think it's the whole balance of all"
"the parts here that makes this such an"
"attractive machine because it has a"
"great keyboard it has a good trackpad"
"has a really nice display especially now"
"with that oled option you've got the"
"upgraded webcam faster now lp ddr5 ram"
"faster nvme uh gen 4 drive so it pretty"
"much i think checks all the boxes for"
"what you would want out of an ultrabook"
"especially if like me you really have"
"been waiting for that oled option so"
"we're just gonna"
"open it up here and let's just see"
"we're gonna start without data"
"so let's go ahead and move forward"
"and"
"you know they just took over the world"
"but"
"just to jump to a site quickly"
"um i will take you over to youtube and"
"let's just take a look at a little bit"
"of what the video performance is like on"
"this display which i believe tops out at"
"roughly 400 nits of brightness"
"we'll go ahead and take a little 4k hdr"
"sample clip"
"and let's just this is always a good"
"benchmark"
"especially since it's designed for oled"
"and you're hearing the speakers too"
"win-win"
"[Music]"
"brightness let's talk about that"
"we're at full brightness right now"
"speakers are right here if that wasn't"
"already obvious on the side of the deck"
"and"
"my mistake there let's get audio all the"
"way up"
"so i think it looks really good it"
"sounds good and then this thing weighs"
"two and a half pounds has a solid"
"processor"
"again it pretty much checks every box"
"especially if you're like me and you"
"still want to have touch screen and the"
"fact that it's matte not high reflective"
"is a godsend now in terms of other"
"things wi-fi 6e that's another upgrade"
"over the previous generation i didn't"
"mention before that is soldered to the"
"board"
"uh but no worries i don't think anyone"
"was really expecting it not to be"
"soldered to the board in a machine like"
"this again under two and a half pounds i"
"think it's technically 2.48 forgive me"
"lenovo"
"but yeah just a really nice machine"
"this is going to be probably very easy"
"to recommend to anyone looking for a"
"lightweight ultrabook with pretty much"
"everything under the sun"
"battery life may be the only drawback"
"but let's test it out and see i mean"
"right now from lenovo it's got a full"
"charge so as soon as this video ends i'm"
"going to start to get an idea of what"
"battery life is really like and just so"
"you know"
"i'll take brightness all the way down"
"right now"
"pretty interesting now it is going to be"
"all about you know the display in my"
"opinion because"
"if you went ahead and got the oled"
"version of this clearly you're going to"
"be working with something that's more"
"power hungry"
"with this display being that hd plus you"
"can't even see it which shows the"
"brightness level on here is good enough"
"but now you can"
"1920x1200 is more than enough for the"
"majority of users"
"and it's going to be the most"
"budget-friendly and again battery life"
"should be the best with this model so in"
"all likelihood this will end up being"
"the most popular model but again"
"that oled display i think sets"
"this"
"lightweight ultrabook apart from much of"
"the competition and it's been tested to"
"military spec so"
"durable carbon fiber body you know no"
"card reader but i don't i don't fault"
"them for that this is just a really well"
"put together machine"
"should be easy to disassemble also"
"so not that there's a lot to do in there"
"other than"
"replace that nvme drive if"
"you so"
"desire so again noting carbon fiber and"
"magnesium build here"
"it's just a really slick ultrabook and"
"again probably one of the easier ones to"
"recommend you got your little"
"lenovo thinkpad"
"x1 blinking"
"dot over the eye while hibernating"
"any questions or comments about this"
"brand new lightweight marvel please feel"
"free to post them hit that like button"
"and as usual please feel free to"
"subscribe and please stay safe"
"later"
"so this is the brand new lenovo thinkpad"
"x1 yoga gen 7 intel 12th gen processors"
"and when i saw this thing i was like"
"cool it looks like the previous one a"
"very attractive laptop but the one thing"
"that i was truly hoping for was the same"
"design treatment that the yoga 9i got if"
"you guys don't remember in that review"
"they changed the design to round out the"
"edges not only did this physically look"
"better but it also feels better it just"
"feels a lot more comfortable to hold in"
"the hand not that this is terrible to"
"hold or anything but these edges are"
"sharp and it just doesn't have that"
"refinement there's tons of i o so on the"

"you"
"hello and welcome to pc mag's coverage"
"of ces 2022 before the show started"
"lenovo gave us a sneak peek at some of"
"the coolest new laptops and other"
"products that they're launching during"
"this year's show so right now we're"
"going to take you to a lenovo product"
"manager showing off the snazzy new"
"thinkpad x series of laptops here we"
"have the 10th generation of our x1"
"carbon that's going to be a 14 inch full"
"performance notebook it's it's truly the"
"best business pc"
"in the middle here we have our x1 nano"
"which is basically the little brother of"
"the x1 carbon it's everything you know"
"and love about the carbon just in that"
"thinner and lighter form factor it's 13"
"inch just a traditional"
"notebook and it's"
"less than a kilogram"
"then we have our x1 yoga gen 7"
"and this is going to be that 14 inch no"
"compromise convertible"
"style notebook"
"so let's actually"
"take a look"
"at the x1"
"yoga here"
"so from a top down view i want to show"
"off the the big design update here which"
"is going to be our communication bar"
"like i said collaboration is"
"very critical"
"so we integrated higher resolution fhd"
"cameras which do take up more space than"
"that 720p hd camera"
"so we're able to put in what we call the"
"communications bar which is going to be"
"able to have that fhd camera without"
"increasing that top bezel size and we"
"also have four 360 degree mics along the"
"top bezel here too for really great"
"audio"
"digital eye strain 2 is becoming more"
"prevalent so we're"
"finding that 65 or more of active pc"
"users are reporting symptoms of eye"
"fatigue"
"so i save certified low blue light"
"displays they're going to help reduce"
"that harmful spectrum of light without"
"changing color accuracy"
"now if we can get this um"
"so we have oled displays"
"oled is great because it provides really"
"vivid visuals and it's been a really hot"
"request from customers all over the"
"world we have it back on the x1 yoga gen"
"7 and for the first time ever on our x1"
"carbon so we're really excited to offer"
"that display option for these two"
"products"
"we also have a new innovation called"
"computer vision technology and that's"
"basically going to analyze metadata from"
"the webcam as you're using your pc in"
"front of you and it's going to give you"
"features like wake on approach and lock"
"on leave like traditional hpd"
"type"
"functionalities and then there's also"
"what's called attention tracking and if"
"you're um looking at your display you"
"have it on full brightness probably and"
"then let's say you have somebody come up"
"and talk to you off to the side so your"
"attention is"
"off of your display you're looking"
"somewhere else"
"the brightness on your display is going"
"to come down to help conserve on battery"
"and that's"
"really great for power management and"
"just extending your battery life in"
"general"
"there's also things like privacy alert"
"when there's somebody overlooking"
"like over your shoulder looking at your"
"display it will alert you saying that"
"you know you might have"
"the information on your display"
"compromise someone's looking at it and"
"then also digital wellness alerts like a"
"posture warning if you're not sitting up"
"straight"
"um"
"so let's take a look at"
"the"
"um x1 carbon"
"so"
"here i have"
"taken apart"
"the bottom cover of an x1 carbon and i"
"had mentioned"
"a little bit about performance already"
"and how we've increased the performance"
"of these pretty significantly gen to gen"
"so we one of the ways we were able to do"
"that was with this air intake keyboard"
"design so here you have the planer board"
"and the dual fan system"
"now underneath here we have implemented"
"this air intake keyboard which is going"
"to be able to take air in from the"
"keyboard"
"and be able to disperse it into this"
"dual fan system"
"to then expel that hot air that's"
"generated out the um"
"back of the system"
"so this is really going to be able to"
"help us"
"get that highest performance out of that"
"p series"
"cpu from intel"
"and what's actually really cool about"
"this and maybe my favorite part is that"
"we were able to maintain the spill"
"resistance of the keyboard so if you"
"ever have accidents and maybe spill a"
"little bit of water or coffee on on your"
"laptop that should still work"
"now"
"the biggest improvement that we've done"
"for"
"our x1 series in terms of performance is"
"definitely around our nano so"
"the first generation of x1 nano we came"
"out with last year and that had the up4"
"intel cpu"
"and this year we really cranked it up"
"two notches so now we're offering p28"
"up to 32 gigs of memory and"
"you can see um"
"that"
"we really had to do a lot here because"
"the the size of the x1 nano is it's so"
"much more compact it's less than a"
"kilogram it's 14 millimeters thin"
"um so"
"we um we really had to tweak our"
"thermals a lot to really be able to"
"get that"
"that same level of performance out of"
"our x1 nano that we do have on our x1"
"carbon and yoga"
"[Music]"
"so what if you could have a 16-inch"
"touch display that was also a computer"
"you could pack up to carry"
"but that could also convert to a 12-inch"
"laptop but that was"
"also durable enough to gain mil-spec"
"certification"
"i know let me explain"
"[Music]"
"this is the 2022 lenovo thinkpad x1 fold"
"and regardless of what you thought of"
"its earlier predecessor from two years"
"ago"
"this is not that computer i mean if you"
"remember michael fisher did all he could"
"to love it but could not but it was"
"mainly because at the time it was pretty"
"experimental"
"this year's x1 fold is a completely"
"different animal with a couple of use"
"cases that"
"make all the logical sense in the world"
"reporting from both new york city and"
"berlin with adam lane on camera i'm"
"hammering out with pocket now and let's"
"dive into our hands-on"
"[Applause]"
"so let's get a few obvious things out of"
"the way yes this new thinkpad x1 fold is"
"a complete redesign from what we had"
"before"
"this baby is not trying to be a tablet"
"one bit to envision it correctly think"
"more of the fact that it has thinkpad in"
"the name and consider it more of a"
"laptop that can become something else so"
"yeah instead of the extended 13-inch"
"display think larger now with a panel"
"that goes all the way to 16.3 inches"
"instead of the chunky build from the"
"past thing thinner and more refined than"
"before"
"instead of just some weird netbook when"
"folded now we're talking about a 12-inch"
"equivalent instead making this feel more"
"like a real notebook computer surely we"
"do lose the kickstand that was built in"
"but i'm actually not going to complain"
"because this feels so much easier to"
"carry from one room to the next lenovo"
"actually made it more modular on the"
"inside the textured back can be removed"
"for you to replace the ssd for more"
"storage and even the option to get a"
"larger battery making it pretty crazy"
"that they were able to make this device"
"thinner but without affecting"
"serviceability obviously that means it's"
"not water resistant but it's mil-spec"
"810g certified so"
"i wouldn't worry too much about dropping"
"it in the field but just keep your"
"coffee in the cup and you'll be fine now"
"while extended this new sharp panel is"
"now of 2.5 k resolution and double the"
"brightness at 600 nits making the"
"experience pretty crisp detailed and"
"more versatile for outdoor use lenovo"
"now provides a stand that's easy to"
"collapse and carry but which i think you"
"might just want to leave in one place"
"for you to prop the device up and use in"
"either portrait or landscape orientation"
"depending on your needs for the day the"
"cramped bluetooth keyboard from before"
"is now gone in favor of a true thinkpad"
"nano size keyboard that can magnetically"
"attach to the stand and help you get"
"work done as if this were some sort of"
"large desktop the trackpad is now"
"finally of a decent size and you even"
"get a touch point making this more of a"
"product you'll want to use for prolonged"
"periods of time this panel also includes"
"full wacom digitizer support making the"
"pen not just any typical stylus the"
"screen is strong enough to truly support"
"anyone's desire to get fully artistic on"
"a much larger canvas though if you're"
"wondering if this is glass it's more"
"like plastic obviously the claim to fame"
"for the computer is the fact that it can"
"fold so once you remove it from the"
"stand you can then fold it into a"
"smaller form factor that's more"
"reminiscent to apple's old 12-inch"
"macbook and where the keyboard now"
"attaches to the bottom portion for this"
"to be a regular laptop now since the"
"fold flat hinge was completely"
"redesigned you won't really be able to"
"carry the keyboard within as you could"
"before but i'll forgive it given how"
"compact it becomes when closed which"
"takes advantage of a bell-shaped design"
"when folded to spare you from a"
"pronounced crease other perks include a"
"better placement for the ir webcam which"
"provides windows hello functionality in"
"all orientations you have three usb-c"
"ports out of which two support"
"thunderbolt 4 so there's one or two"
"available no matter how you place it"
"heck there's even a third speaker built"
"in so that stereo audio is available on"
"all modes and addressing one of the"
"biggest pain points of its predecessor"
"now as for internals we're talking"
"intel's 12th generation u9 core i9"
"processor up to 12 gigs of ram one"
"terabyte of storage intel iris xc"
"graphics the latest wi-fi bluetooth and"
"even 5g support which comes optional the"
"battery might not be the largest but it"
"can rapid charge and again you do have"
"the option to replace it last but not"
"least we have windows 11 which is"
"clearly better designed for a product"
"like this than windows 10 was"
"this allows for snapping in a far more"
"seamless way and for the short time i"
"use this prototype i can tell you it"
"fits like a glove this new thinkpad is"
"far more snappy and responsive than"
"before which is definitely what the"
"creatives and business users at targets"
"are looking for starting price is 24.99"
"and with the expected launch date of"
"november 2022 from just a few hours of"
"views i do have to tell you this is a"
"far better product than before one i'd"
"be willing to consider at least from"
"first impressions obviously we'll give"
"you a final verdict on what it's like to"
"actually use it in the real world in our"
"full review which should come later this"
"year but so far so good let us know what"
