               The recommended
               amount (although
               everyone needs a
               different
               amount) of
               sunscreen should
               only be a nickel
               size. Although
               it says to apply
               liberally, going
               a little heavy-
               handed can cause
               a white cast. I
               recommend
               dotting
               sunscreen over
               your whole face
               little by
               little, lightly
               tapping or
               massaging until
               an even white
               cast appears
               over the whole
               face, and then   2018-

              Neutrogena&#39;s &#39;sheer touch &#39;formula
              sunblocks are really not &#39;sheer touch&#39;
              from me using it. I have oily skin and it does
              leave me looking really shining. It does NOT have
              a matte look and it does feel a bit oily/ sticky.
              To be fair to Neutrogena, even the Shiseido
              √Ånessa touted for it&#39;s lightweight and non-
              sticky feel also felt sticky and looked shiny on
              my skin. I&#39;ve tried Sunplay&#39;s sunscreens
              and La Roche Posey as well. The La Roche Posey
              one in the small shaker bottle is the lightest
              and least greasy feeling of all. I use it on      2021-
              &#39;special&#39; occasions because it&#39;s a    12-

              I&#39;ve recently purchased neutrogena mineral
              sunscreen and watched a vid yesterday about how
              american sunscreens are not that great as they
              focus on UVB (prevents sunburn) but not UVA (skin
              cancer &amp; aging). So I checked the neutrogena
              one and it says at the back that it prevents
              sunburn but you need to use with a sunscren
              product to prevent skin cancer/aging??? Like it
              says broad spectrum at the front, but that tiny   2021-
              detail at the back basically means that it&#39;s  05-
              only blocking UVB and you&#39;d need something    05T03:

              description ( oil free and PABA free). But when I
              went through the product ingredients they include 2018-

              sweat more and the dirt sticks to my face.....
              Why i still use it, is because i like the fact
              that its spf 50 and does not make my face look
              very dry and patchy, but i also hate the fact
              that it gets oily to fast and i need to apply a   2016-

                    I tried the Neutrogena Beach Defense
                    sunscreen. Oh my gosh, I had such a
                    reaction! It caused irritation to my
                    eyes to the 9&#39;s. Wow. My eyes
                    watered as if they were fountains !
                    My eyes swelled up a bit, got a
                    little pink. They were VERY irritated
                    for HOURS ! <br>Glad I could get a
                    refund on that bottle !!! And, by the 2022-

                    I&#39;ve only tried the Hydro boost
                    sunscreen so far. I HATE it lol. My
                    skin is mildly dry, and acne prone.
                    It doesn&#39;t &#39;sink&#39; in, it
                    remains oily looking which I dislike,
                    and it also stings my eyes so I end
                    up wearing something different for my
                    eyes. Defeats the purpose of me
                    trying to use one sunscreen for
                    everything to save time and money,
                    because so many sunscreens are stupid
                    unaffordable. Oh and it is prone to
                    pilling. Aint got time to be waiting
                    for more stuff to &#39;settle&#39;
                    before I can apply sunscreen.         2022-

                    The beach defense lotion sunscreen is
                    greasy as HELLLLL what u mean!
                    I&#39;ll apply it, keep rubbing and
                    rubbing and even 5 hours later my
                    skin still feels like an oil slick,
                    just awful. The ultra sheer spray
                    seemed ok but I just don&#39;t fully
                    trust sprays for proper protection,

                    thanks so much!!! I just picked up
                    the neutrogena beach defense stick

                    but never in rashes or anything so
                    the very small amount of fragrance is
                    totally alright for me. And its super 2022-

                    I have just stumbled onto your video
                    (first time here). Really love how
                    clearly you articulate the message,
                    and how thought-through and
                    structured your video is. I would say
                    - please add more names or images on
                    the screen when you speak, so it
                    follows what you are saying and is
                    more interesting to the eye than only
                    seeing an up-close image of you
                    (although you are a beautiful person)
                    :)<br>Just thought I&#39;d give a bit
                    of feedback :)<br>I personally use
                    the N. stick (pink one) on my 3yo
                    son, as he is eczema prone, plus I
                    also steer clear of Denat. Alc. and
                    fragrance, but that one is quite
                    difficult to apply as it&#39;s very
                    solid, so you need to push quite hard
                    to apply it correctly, and my son

                    Almost every Japanese sunscreen has
                    alcohol denatured in it, and that
                    what sets them apart and that is
                    exactly why people love Japanese
                    sunscreens. They have the best finish
                    and spread on easily without leaving
                    any cast, unlike most of the
                    sunscreens in the US. Also, there‚Äôs   2022-
                    no data that state alcohol denatured  06-

                    Might be a silly question, but skin
                    cancer and sun allergies run in my
                    family. I find now that I&#39;m
                    getting older my skin is becoming
                    much more sensitive to the sun
                    (I&#39;m also extremely pale).
                    I&#39;ve been using SPF 110, but
                    I&#39;ve heard that anything over 50/
                    55 is unnecessary. What is your
                    opinion on what SPF I should use? I   2022-

                    I just bought the sheer zinc and
                    I&#39;ve done a patch test just in
                    case it does irritate me, and so far
                    its a little white but not horribly
                    so, although I&#39;ve only used a
                    little so its hard to tell. it is
                    very hard to spread so reapplication
                    in my dark asf school bathrooms would
                    be very difficult. it doesn&#39;t
                    seem too greasy which is great for my
                    oily skin. would recommend for under  2021-

                    I feel like it&#39;s probably better
                    to use a sunscreen daily with
                    alcohol, if you&#39;ll actually wear
                    it every day. The minor damage from
                    the alcohol is nothing compared to
                    skin cancer. It&#39;s hard for me to
                    find a sunscreen that doesn&#39;t
                    feel heavy, greasy, gross, or sticky.
                    I&#39;ll actually wear the
                    hydroboost, so I&#39;ll continue to
                    wear it until I find something better
                    ü§∑ It&#39;s like they say, the best
                    sunscreen is the one you&#39;ll wear
                    every day. It doesn&#39;t matter how  2021-

                    I always want to know more about all
                    of Neutrogena sunscreens. I just
                    bought the clear face spf55 and
                    sensitive skin spf60. The clear skin
                    stings my face, I can put on my neck
                    and other body parts. The sensitive
                    is kinda heavy and need to really rub
                    in, but it does not sting my face.
                    Both were cheap. I went back to Elta
                    MD for my face, but using the
                    Neutrogena to save $! You explain

                    shoulders and upper arms have finally
                    started to heal and peel. The

                    i recently bought the clear face spf
                    50 and there&#39;s no oxybenzone in
                    the product !! i recommend this
                    sunscreen if you have acne prone /
                    oily skin. there&#39;s no fragrance
                    and no oil. it feels great , and i
                    noticed little to no sensation of the
                    sunscreen on the skin. hope this

                    Very informative and well done video.
                    I found your channel because I was
                    looking for a tinted mineral
                    sunscreen spf 50 for dry skin. I
                    currently use Australian gold tinted
                    for face but I notice that after the
                    sunscreen my skin start feeling
                    tighter and dryer. What kind of
                    sunscreen do you recommend for dry
                    skin. Also could you please do a
                    video about Sunscreens for dry skin.  2021-

                    I had recently bought the Beach
                    Defense SPF 70 but the bottle says
                    oxybenzone free, but in the video,
                    you stated says the Beach Defense SPF 2021-
                    70 is not oxybenzone free. Is the     05-

                    love your content, it is fantastic
                    and just what I need!! I am 56 and I

                    sun with Coppertone SPF 4. Ugh!! I

                    I have to say I think I have been

                    dermatologist that I see. Just
                    recently I have been trying tretinoin
                    (0.05%) 1x a week so I know I have to
                    keep my face protected and out of the
                    sun as much as possible. I use Drunk
                    Elephant sunscreen on my face as the
                    last step of my AM skin care routine  2021-

                    This is the best informational video
                    on sunscreen. I literally just came
                    back from the drugstore with the

                    Really awesome video. One question,
                    can you layers sunscreens? There is
                    any advantage to it? Like you apply a
                    moisturizer with chemical spf under
                    30 (like Cerave light spf 25) and
                    then you have to go out, can you let  2021-

                    Thank you!!! Do you have any
                    information about shiseido sunscreens
                    because I have extremely dry skin and
                    roseacea and I don&#39;t know why I
                    think it might be good for me because
                    the comments about this product they
                    said is to oily, if you can make a

                    will be interesting. Thank you for    2021-

                    54 year old male here. Starting to
                    look pretty old. I did not use
                    sunscreen in my younger days, but as
                    I got older, I would use it when
                    swimming or visiting a beach. I‚Äôve
                    recently started using the Clear Face
                    every day. The reason I have not used
                    sunscreen in the past is that I sweat
                    very badly, especially in the summer.
                    During these winter COVID months,
                    I‚Äôve been working from home so I
                    basically just see my wife and son.
                    When I eventually return to the
                    office, the summertime heat will be
                    in full force. I generally have not
                    worn sunscreen, moisturizers or any
                    kind of lotions at all because they
                    make me sweat even more and my face
                    will look very wet, greasy and shiny.
                    Even though my skin is dry, I can‚Äôt
                    apply these products in the hotter
                    months due to the sweating. The Clear
                    Face absorbs pretty well for me and
                    I‚Äôd like to keep wearing it to
                    protect my skin, but I can‚Äôt imagine
                    wearing this I the middle of July,
                    much less adding a moisture product.
                    And that‚Äôs just my face. Lotions on
                    my legs, arms, etc. (which are very
                    dry) creep me out because of the
                    stickiness from sweating. Any
                    suggestions? Or maybe you could do a
                    video on using products for people
                    who sweat excessively. I‚Äôve used
                    Certin-Dri for my underarms since my
                    early twenties and it works very
                    well, but it doesn‚Äôt help the rest of
                    my body. I can still remember the
                    excitement of actually being able to
                    raise my arms in the air wearing a
                    gray sweatshirt without having black  2021-

                    No matter what I try, I always go
                    back to my tried and true, Nutrogena
                    ultra sheer spf 30. It gives me a
                    radiant glow to where people ask me
                    what I am wearing on my skin, yet it
                    is nearly invisible. And I am Afro
                    Caribbean; it‚Äôs great for all skin
                    tones. I have even tried some
                    European sunscreens, but I always
                    return to this one. I use the Sheer   2021-
                    zinc when I know I‚Äôm going to be      02-
                    active outdoors. That one does make   13T17:

                    Hydro Boost doesn‚Äôt have Oxybenzone.
                    It says right the front oxybenzone
                    free. It has Avobenzone. It actually
                    has all of the chemicals you
                    mentioned at the beginning of the
                    video except oxybenzone. Avobenzone
                    (3%), Homosalate (15%), Octosalte
                    (5%), and Octocrylene (10%) It‚Äôs only
                    slightly fragranced and I‚Äôve only
                    just recently started using a
                    sunscreen daily buy I love it because
                    it has no white cast, it‚Äôs not
                    greasy, the fragrance doesn‚Äôt bother
                    me, and it‚Äôs very moisturizing. I use
                    Cerave Moisturizing Cream at night
                    after my shower and then this         2021-
                    functions as my moisturizer for the   02-

                    I have a question about the Sensitive
                    Skin Face sunscreen 50 spf versus the
                    Sheer Zinc Face 50 spf. Since the
                    Sensitive Skin Face has 4.9 %
                    Titanium Dioxide and Zinc Oxide 2.9 %
                    and the Sheer Zinc spf has 21.6 %
                    Zinc Oxide only, does that mean that
                    the Sensitive Skin face isn&#39;t as
                    potent? It&#39;s confusing because    2021-
                    they have the same SPF, but obviously 02-
                    one has a lot more Zinc Oxide than    12T20:

                    Fantastic review, although zinc
                    sunscreens, including Neutrogena,
                    does leave a white cast if you do not
                    have light skin. I&#39;ve only been
                    able to use a few tinted zinc
                    sunscreens without looking ashy or
                    like a ghost. I hope more companies
                    in the future expand their color
                    range of tinted zinc sunscreens to
                    represent America&#39;s diverse
                    population. For now,

                    recommended products which contained
                    Avobenzone? It works the same as
                    Oxybenzone in that it penetrates the
                    skin and is also used to help other
                    chemicals penetrate the skin. And
                    because it is also not as stable,
                    manufacturers add other ingredients   2021-
                    like Homosalate and Octocrylene which 01-

                    hate it because the fragrance

                    Hi Dr. Locke! I do really well with
                    high zinc content mineral sunscreens
                    and I do love the Sheer Zinc. I do
                    use a double cleanse with an oil to
                    break it down before using my gentle
                    cleanser. Strangely specific
                    question: Can I use the Aveeno Skin
                    Relief Shower and Bath Oil to break
                    down the sunscreen on my face as a
                    part of my double cleanse? It&#39;s   2020-

                    I used to just random pick one from

                    that was ok and I have been using
                    this one for years now. When I
                    checked the ingredients, lukily it is
                    a mineral one, but sadly it contains
                    denatured alcohol. No wonder my skin
                    have been feeling so dry the last     2020-

                    Omg I hate the Sheer Zinc face one,
                    is so sticky, difficult to spread,
                    the white cast is tremendous and even
                    harder to remove. I know I am well
                    protected, but it is not an elegant   2020-

                    Zinc is terrible for the environment
                    bc it doesn‚Äôt breakdown and it is
                    used in huge amounts to make formula
                    effective. Zinc is really bad for     2020-

                    I&#39;m watching this video for
                    sunscreen advice, but I don&#39;t use
                    Neutrogena because they test their
                    products on laboratory dogs. I have a
                    dog and my groomer told me that you
                    can&#39;t use human soaps or shampoos
                    on dogs because their body ph is
                    different from humans so I don&#39;t
                    know why we test sunscreens &amp;

                    I recently found your channel, and I
                    love how in depth you explain things.
                    <br>In this one I would like to have
                    heard a reference to the fact that
                    both &quot;chemical&quot; and
                    &quot;mineral&quot; sunscreens have
                    chemicals. Minerals are
                    chemicals.<br> Referring to a mineral
                    sunscreen as being less risky because
                    it doesn&#39;t have chemicals feeds
                    the anti-chemicals ideas that are
                    going around. People need to
                    understand that everything is a
                    chemical, and that &quot;safe&quot;   2020-
                    doesn&#39;t equal &quot;chemical-     12-

                    After a very serious illness, my skin
                    was insanely sensitive and I looked
                    for new sunscreens. I did really like
                    the SheerZinc although I didn&#39;t
                    realize the face one had colloidal
                    oatmeal so I may try that one on my
                    next purchase. It does leave a bit of
                    a cast, however it seems to fade
                    within about 20 minutes. I find it
                    easier to apply several thin layers
                    to get enough instead of gooping on a
                    blob and trying to spread it all
                    over.<br><br>As I have recovered, my
                    face is less sensitive than it was,
                    so I can go back to using some of the
                    others before they expire. Before I   2020-

                    dermatology is your passion, but you

                    I recently tried a neutrogena serum
                    sunscreen spf 60. I thought it&#39;d
                    be great. It was awful! Very greasy
                    but the worst part was the
                    overwhelming scent. I&#39;m not
                    overly sensitive but it didn&#39;t go 2020-

                    you so much for your recommendations.
                    I purchased the Sensitive Skin Face
                    Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50. After
                    trying out so many drugstore
                    sunscreens, literally, I am in tears,
                    Sensitive Skin Face Mineral sunscreen
                    truly a gem! I am also a huge fan of
                    La-Roche Posay skincare and so
                    underneath this sunscreen, I will
                    have layered The Ordinary 10%
                    Niacinimide + Zinc along with La
                    Roche Posay&#39;s Toleriane Ultra day
                    moisturizer. This combination is
                    amazing! does not break me out, feels
                    lightweight, a comfortable matte, I
                    love that this sunscreen that stays
                    in place, does not slide around.
                    Also, to solve the white cast, I will
                    apply a thin layer of the La Roche
                    Posay TINTED Mineral SPF 50 over the
                    Sensitive Skin Face Mineral Sunscreen 2020-

                    I&#39;ve spent years trying to make
                    mineral sunscreens work for me, but
                    with my skin tone, the cast is so bad
                    that it turns purple/blue. It&#39;s
                    just not professional and I&#39;m not
                    willing to spend more than 5 min
                    applying sunscreen on my body every
                    morning. So chemical sunscreens it
                    is! This was super informative, so
                    thank you! I&#39;m so excited because

                    I&#39;ve been using the Purito
                    Unscented sunscreen and I like it a
                    lot. I don&#39;t care for the white
                    cast from the Neutrogena Sensitive
                    Skin sunscreens. I would like to try
                    the Neutrogena Clear Face, but I
                    hesitated over the cinnamon bark
                    extract in the ingredients, although
                    it&#39;s listed at the bottom. I have
                    sensitive skin, and it seems to react
                    to fragrance and some plant extracts.
                    I&#39;ve read that there was a
                    sunscreen addition to the CARES Act,
                    so I&#39;m hoping that means more
                    actives for US sunscreens. Although,  2020-
                    I don&#39;t know what that means for  10-

                    Hello! Lovely video. Don&#39;t think
                    you mentioned this, but I was
                    wondering about Neutrogena&#39;s
                    Ultra Sheer (Face) LIQUID Sunscreen
                    Broad Spectrum SPF 70? Is it okay to
                    use? (I originally LOVED
                    Neutrogena&#39;s Ultra sheer Water-
                    light Daily face sunscreen SPF 60,
                    but they either discontinued it, or
                    changed packaging cause I
                    couldn&#39;t find it to repurchase OR
                    any recent reviews...) OR maybe they
                    took out the &quot;Water-light&quot;
                    title, making them both the same
                    exact product? Very confused on which
                    is which, if they are now the same,
                    or if I should even be using it. A
                    big mystery lol...If you are able to  2020-
                    help that would mean the world &lt;3  10-

                    Between the sheer zinc mineral lotion
                    and the baby sheer zinc mineral
                    lotion, as a user of both for years,
                    id recommend the baby version as it
                    has a much smoother formula. And it
                    isnt as drying as the regular sheer
                    zinc mineral in my opinion. Hope this
                    helps someone. I also find the white
                    cast easier to blend out and as you   2020-
