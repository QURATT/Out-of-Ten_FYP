                THIS WHOLE BRAND OF FOUNDATION AND
                THE CONCEALER WRECKED MY SKIN AND
                IT&#39;S NEVER ACTUALLY HEALED. I
                HAD LOVELY SKIN BEFORE USING THERE
                FOUNDATION. I LOOKED AT OTHER VIEWS

                Hi Sarah! I know this is an old
                video but hopefully you see this. A
                few years ago when my son was a
                baby and I was a SAHM I began
                watching makeup videos. Your
                channel was one that I watched
                alot. For some reason You Tube
                stopped recommending your videos.
                TBH, I miss the old time videos.
                Before everyone became
                &quot;infuencers&quot; and
                everything got so fancy. I hope
                your family is doing well!!!! I
                have hereditary dark circles too
                and I loved your try ons of         2022-
                concealers to see what covers them. 04-

Vines           Shade wich u hv used?               37:47Z     0     0
                I am very fair (neutral) with
                noticeable dark circles, as well as
                a combination sensitive skin type.
                Their lightest shade is too dark
                but I use it for colour correcting.
                When I apply it it burns really
                badly for a bit but then stops
                really suddenly. Thought maybe my
                skin was just being sensitive so I
                kept using it. After a couple of
                days I developed these hot pink
                spots almost like burst capillaries
                everywhere I use the concealer
                (eyelids and undereyes). Took a
                couple of days of not using it to

                Lol.. I thought i was the only one
                that experienced the burning
                sensation under my eyes. Since none
                of the beauty gurus video mentioned
                any of this. I don‚Äôt really reach
                for the maybelline fit me concealer
                because of the burning sensation it
                gives if I don‚Äôt blend it fast. I
                find myself reaching for the LA
                Girl pro concealer more and it
                doesn‚Äôt burn my under eye area. I
                only use tarte shape tape concealer
                for more fuller coverage on
                occasions because it can be too
                thick for everyday look. LA Girl
                pro concealer works best than this
                maybelline fit me (although I
                repurchased multiple times before
                trying the LA Girl) i ran out of
                the LA Girl pro concealer and I     2018-
                just had to repurchase because it‚Äôs 03-

                I started using that concealer two
                years ago, and it stung under my
                eyes too. It also doesn‚Äôt blend
                that well into my skin. I switched
                to the cover girl ready set
                gorgeous concealer and I actually
                prefer that one over this one. It
                blends into my skin better,
                brightens my under eye. However
                there isn‚Äôt that much coverage but  2018-
                I prefer that because I like        03-

                Good review! I&#39;ve heard similar
                complaints about how the concealer
                stings under the eye, ouch! Just a
                suggestion.. I recommend in your
                future videos that you put in the
                info box a list of products that
                you are using/wearing in your       2018-

                How odd. I have been using this
                concealer for months now and I have
                never experienced stinging under
                the eye. Maybe they changed the
                formula in the new shades? I also
                found that I got pretty good
                coverage when I use this concealer.
                The only thing I do different is I  2018-

                   Hi Kristi! Been using this
                   concealer for years and
                   years. Sometimes I stray
                   away just to try something
                   new but I always find my way
                   back to the Maybelline age
                   rewind. Other than ELF
                   moisturizing Camo concealer
                   there is none better for me.
                   Plus both are so affordable. 2022-

                   I friccin hate this product.
                   It&#39;s overall really
                   terrible and doesn&#39;t
                   give any coverage or a nice
                   texture. It feels like
                   microplastic, which I&#39;m
                   sure it is. I paid $2 for it
                   at a thrift store and I got
                   ripped off. It creases under
                   my eyes and looks like a
                   thin film of cornstarch on
                   my forehead. When I touch it
                   it feels soft like an oil,
                   but it&#39;s really just
                   tiny plastic beads so
                   I&#39;ve done nothing but
                   wipe the product away
                   instead of oil. Sucks I have
                   to use it up but I made my
                   own bed with this one. Also
                   they really wasted packaging 2022-

                   I&#39;ve recently spent more
                   money on make-up that
                   doesn&#39;t work for me in
                   the last month then I&#39;ve
                   spent in my entire life.
                   I&#39;m 51 and starting to

                   the more my wrinkles get
                   amplified. I gave this
                   product a go yesterday. I
                   applied it until my dark
                   spots were covered and
                   blended perfectly. I ran
                   into the same problem I
                   always have. Great looking

                   This is my go to concealer
                   !!!!! I set it right away so
                   it doesn&#39;t crease. Even
                   with eye cream, my under
                   eyes can still be very dry
                   some days. On those days I
                   tap in the powder with a
                   slightly damp sponge.
                   <br>After using it awhile,
                   if the sponge becomes yucky
                   looking, I just pull it off
                   &amp; throw it away. The
                   concealer will still come up
                   thru the top with the sponge
                   off. I apply it with my
                   fingers, then sponge, set as
                   usual. <br>I hope you&#39;re
                   enjoying using it. The only
                   other one I use, but
                   it&#39;s pricey, is the
                   Clinique Airbrush Concealer.
                   This Maybelline one is a
                   pretty good dupe for it. I
                   think the Age Rewind costs
                   less at Walmart than at
                   Ulta. <br>I hope you&#39;re  2019-

                 I have the Fit Me
                 Concealer in two
                 different shades and I
                 purchased The Age Rewind
                 Concealer so many times
                 already as well! I used
                 to be obsessed with it
                 but I think the
                 performance changes
                 after a while from
                 opening it. Because as
                 you said I noticed that
                 it started look more dry
                 and showing my fine
                 lines more. I also
                 really like the
                 L&#39;Oreal True Match
                 Concealer and I think
                 it&#39;s actually my     2018-
                 favourite from the       11-

        Thanks for the
        review. I have dry
        undereyes, so
        I&#39;ll probably
        skip this one.
        Have you tried the
        NYX Bare with Me
        concealer? I&#39;m
        not sure how long
        that ones been
        out, but I saw it
        in my Target a
        couple weeks ago
        and I really love
        that one. I dont
        usually buy high
        end concealer but
        I did pick up the
        ABH Magic Touch
        concealer and the
        Lancome Teint Idol
        concealer, and
        they are both
        really <b>really</
        b> good! I&#39;m
        41 and heard the
        Lancome was great
        for
        &quot;mature&quot;
        skin, which is why
        I grabbed that
        one, but honestly
        my absolute fave
        is the ABH Magic
        Touch. It&#39;s so
        amazing! I even
        picked up a 2nd
        one just to have
        on hand. The NYX
        Bare with Me is
        right up there     2021-12-

                   I have tried ever foundation cheap most expensive and it just doesn&#39;t look good on my skin. My overall skin texture is ok I have Light Skin Brunette hair Brown eyes now that I hit early 40s I have redness around nose dark circles slightly visible pores
                   on my cheeks my most problem is a little milla and im starting to get beauty marks on my face they fade in color due to serums but they do look like tiny bumps on my temple and high cheek area. I think the issue with foundation is the different textures and 2021-
                   formulas. I find concealer doesn&#39;t have that texture if that makes sense The Best Concealers as foundation that I have used are Mac Select Cover Up NC25 unfortunately they dicont. It. So I then ran across Revlon Age Defying Targeted Dark Spot Concealer  04-
                   , Light/Medium OMG its Gorg on the Skin. It covers like a dream The consistency is amazing. NOW THE PROBLEM I can&#39;t find it anywhere So it looks like another Discount. Product. So Im willing to give the Maybelline Age Rewind a Shot as a foundation.      11T04:

                    shade for a while
                    and when I came
                    across a video of
                    yours , i can
                    definitely say I
                    found the perfect
                    shade with the LA
                    Girl foundation ,

                    I use the Catrice
                    liquid camouflage
                    in light beige.
                    Its matte, thin
                    &amp; comes with
                    an applicator
                    like the
                    Maybelline. Its
                    about R75 but its
                    the only thing
                    that works for me
                    as i tend to
                    sweat alot. The
                    only downfall is
                    there&#39;s only
                    2 shades light
                    beige &amp;
                    porcelain. It is
                    abit too light
                    but i make it
                    work by baking
                    with a darker
                    powder. The la
