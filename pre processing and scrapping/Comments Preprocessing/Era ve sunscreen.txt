            It‚Äôs was really

            Dear cerave was
            recommended by

            dermatologist
            if a doctor
            recommend it
            then it‚Äôs not
            harmful like
            you say.. I
            doubt a doctor
            will recommend

            I had a severe
            allergic
            reaction to the
            AM Cerave
            moisturizer spf
            30. I purchased
            it at target
            and it
            wasn&#39;t
            expired. The
            next morning I
            woke up with a
            itchy and
            burning face
            (contact
            dermatitis) and
            it lasted a
            good week. My
            skin barrier
            was so damaged
            and ended up
            super dry and
            peeling in the
            end. It
            happened to me
            2x, I
            wasn&#39;t sure
            if it was the
            cerave or
            another product
            I used so I
            tried it alone
            weeks later and
            it happened
            again. I am
            pregnant so it
            could just be
            my hormones
            making my skin
            ultra sensitive 2022-

            Wish i saw this
            before. I got
            them yesterday
            online.. i just
            put my vitamin
            c from derma
            e.. and then
            applied the am
            mosturizer and
            then the
            sunscreen. It
            peeled it
            itches and i
            look like a
            ghost.. it
            didnt blendüò°.
            The pm and
            cleanser worked
            for me but this 2022-
            2 things were a 01-
            waste of money  21T20:

            Not sure if
            this will work
            for everyone,
            but I find it
            helpful if I
            use one full
            pump and
            quickly apply
            it all over my
            face. Prior to
            doing this I
            would apply
            little dots of
            sunscreen all
            over my face
            but I&#39;d get
            pilling. Now I
            just use one
            full pump, and
            apply it all
            over quickly so
            I have a heavy
            white cast and
            then take some
            time to work
            the sunscreen
            in to get rid
            of the white    2021-
            cast! Hope this 08-
            helps some      19T11:

            Wow, I have
            been using the
            Cereve spf 30
            moisturizer for
            about 2 weeks
            and love it! I
            haven&#39;t
            tried it with
            an actual
            foundation but
            I have used it
            with a tinted
            moisturizer and
            had no issues.
            Guess it just
            goes to show    2021-

            Thanks for the
            info.
            Wow...that
            expensive
            product will
            give a üëé
            answer. It will
            not work fr my
            skin type as
            well. Hehehe.
            Currently, I am
            using the Biore
            Cool Gel or UV
            Aqua Rich from
            Japan. Because
            its easy to
            blend with
            moisturizer and
            it has SPF 50.

              The main thing I like
              about this CeraVe
              sunscreen is that it
              doesn&#39;t irritate my
              eyes like most other
              sunscreens, especially
              those that are scented.
              It also feels nice on my  2022-
              skin. Obviously, I        09-

              informative vid. Question
              -- was I&#39;ve moved to
              mineral (zinc) sunscreens
              (spf 50 or higher), I
              normally put a
              moisturizer on 15 seconds
              before I put on the       2022-
              sunscreen. It blends in   09-
              so much better. So is     10T22:

              Hello Dr. I was surprised
              to find this discouraging
              review due the white cast
              and wondered why you did
              not include their tinted
              SPF 30 mineral sunscreen
              ü§î. <br>I‚Äôve been very
              satisfied with it, but I
              was wondering about the
              difference between the
              CeraVe tinted SPF30 and
              the Australian Gold
              tinted SPF 50, since the
              CeraVe has almost double
              the amount of Titanium
              and Zinc oxide. <br>I     2022-

              I use this one combined
              with cerave mineral
              sunscreen spf30 sheer
              tint. It quiets the harsh
              ghost faceüëª and adds a
              nice makeup-like finish.
              Also, you can play with
              the measurements. If your
              a biter darker add more
              sheer tint. If your
              lighter add more of the
              other one. Cons: It does
              have a pretty oily finish
              but you can just blot it
              with a tissue. If you
              have deeper toned skin

              Thank you for the review!
              very informative as
              always. I wonder what you
              think about the product
              Cerave am lotion as
              sunscreen. Would be nice
              if you could make a
              comparison video on this.

              I like this and do not
              mind the white cast as I
              prefer a mineral

              has zinc but also
              titanium dioxide as that

              Hi Dr Sugai, thanks for
              your review. I just
              bought this product
              because of the
              ingredients. I have acne
              prone skin and I normally
              use niacinamide and zinc
              serum after cleansing,
              and then use facial
              lotion containing
              salicylic acid. I was
              wondering if it‚Äôs ok to
              use this sunscreen (which
              also contains
              niacinamide) or Is it
              better to replace my      2021-
              serum with hyaluronic     03-

              I love this sunscreen. I
              don‚Äôt mind the white cast
              because it lets me know
              that my skin is
              protected. I‚Äôve tried
              chemical sunscreens and
              honestly even tho they go
              on clear, I am not
              confident in the
              efficacy. With a mineral
              sunscreen I know for
              certain that my skin is
              protected. Plus I like
              Cerave because I can just
              put it on and go. Whereas
              with chemical sunscreen   2020-

              European or Asian

              Glad I found your
              channel. Male Asian here
              from Europe - we
              don&#39;t have many
              mineral sunscreens in
              Europe, and if we do,
              they all have a white
              cast for my fitzpatrick
              type IV skin. As a male
              I&#39;m not keen on
              tinted as it looks as
              though I have got makeup
              on. I also cycle to work
              everyday. Maybe you could
              review some water
              resistant sunscreens for
              men (I&#39;ve tried Elta
              MD replenish and it has a
              significant whitecast)?   2020-

              Hi Doctor Daniel! What
              are your thoughts about
              liquid-y ZnO sunscreens?
              Do you think they work
              just as the emollient
              ones? According to some
              customer reviews that I
              have read, while they are
              more elegant than a sun
              cream, they are also more
              likely to leave a patchy
              appearance on the skin,
              hence, uneven protection
              on the entire surface of
              the skin. Here are
              products I have found:

              spf-50</a> - I was shookt
              when I saw the price of
              this one. Lol. But thank
              goodness, it&#39;s 100
              mL, not 50ml or less.
              Otherwise, it&#39;s a no
              for me for NOW. üòÇ. They
              also dislose the UVAPF to
              be 20. Which is not bad
              tbh. <br><br>I am
              currently looking for
              some sunscreens that I
              can use in case I visit
              Hawaii, with respect to
              their sunscreen
              regulations ofcourse.
              That&#39;s why I found
              these. <br><br>I hope you 2020-
              consider reviewing these  08-
              in the future. ~Kind      28T22:

              you would be interested
              in trying would be All

              only 15~20 bucks. It also

              As a guy with fitzpatrick type 2
              skin, this stuff was unwearable
              unfortunately. If you have fair
              skin and perhaps warmer undertones,
              this stuff will look very orange.
              Also this stuff is absolute hell to
              wash out of facial hair. I
              don&#39;t know what it is but it
              feels like such a waste that I have
              it. For me the DRMTLGY universal    2022-

              Omg, I loved my skin, was very
              proud of it. Unluckily I fell off a
              bike, now there is a small purple/
              pink scar on my knee cap. Do you
              think a tinted sheer sunscreen will
              cover up that small scar and make
              it even? Do you have any
              recommendations such as liquid
              makeup or a tinted moisturizer or
              sunscreen? Something very low       2022-

              I have combo oily skin. I have been
              using this for a few days and I am
              olive with warm tones. I feel like
              the tint is perfect. It leaves my
              face feeling really good and not
              clogged because it‚Äôs mineral. It
              also dries nicely. Not to dry or
              matte, but leaves my skin tone nice
              and even. No scents. I also use a
              Lancome Visionarre and then apply
              this. I would suggest for those who
              are breaking out to but down a
              simple moisturizer base that you
              like first and then the Cerave
              Tinted Sunscreen. It also does not
              leave an overcast on my skin. I
              also use the Cerave SPF moisturizer 2021-
              with no tint too. It‚Äôs the ultra    04-
              light. Also feels good. I use that  07T03:

              same experience with this
              sunscreen! It is a bit too
              hydrating for me and I have dry
              skin and I live in the dry desert
              of Las Vegas! The tint is a tiny
              bit too dark but I&#39;m just happy
              it&#39;s not a white cast! I just
              ran out and I purchased a new
              bottle! I like how it looks,
              however, because it never
              completely dries it can be a bit
              itchy if I don&#39;t lightly
              powder. <br>Honestly, I make it
              work since it&#39;s the best most
              affordable mineral sunscreen that
              doesn&#39;t give me a white cast! I
              wear blush and concealer over it so 2020-

              I wish they were cruelty free.
              I&#39;d love to try some of their
              products. I will say the Drunk
              Elephant tinted sunscreen is too
              dark for me. Also expensive and has
              the marula oil in it so it feels
              thick and oily on application.
              However works well under makeup. I
              had to cut it with the no color
              (white) one. I&#39;ve decided the
              DE products are too moisturizing
              for normal skin. I&#39;m always up  2020-
              for a good physical sunscreen       09-

              Great timely video. I‚Äôm about to
              run out of that Paula‚Äôs Choice
              sunscreen. I do have the bare
              minerals tinted sunscreen and I
              hated the first aid beauty. Mine is
              pure minerals. I might like it in
              the winter but it makes me too oily
              right now. I‚Äôm lighter than you so
              I don‚Äôt think the Cereve will work
              for me, which is good to know! I
              love the Paula‚Äôs choice. I was just 2020-
              hoping to pick something up at the  08-
              grocery store. Thanks for this      31T13:

               Im glad for the
               ceramides, but is
               still expensive. Imho
               no sunscreen should
               be less than 2
               ounces. Thats the     2021-

               I think with zinc
               oxide stuff you have
               to really rub it on
               your fingers to warm
               it up and pat it on
               the skin and there‚Äôs
               a little less of a
               cast. <br><br>CeraVe
               has always been more
               expensive for
               drugstore stuff tbh.
               I do like Japanese
               and Korean
               sunscreens, they tend
               to be better for POC
               since they are
               allowed to use newer,
               more effective UV

               I&#39;ve had the same
               issue with
               sunscreens. I
               actually just bought
               this sunscreen today
               (the cerave sheer
               tint) I really like
               it for my skin tone.
               I found that they rub
               in a lot better and
               you will have a lot
               less friction if you
               start off with a
               little bit and
               gradually add more as
               you rub it in. When
               the sunscreen starts
               getting dry it&#39;s
               harder to rub in and
               you get more
               friction. I&#39;ve
               had sunscreens that
               leave a horrible
               white cast, but when
               I gradually rub them
               in the cast is
               minimal. Also if your 2020-
               skin is hydrated and  12-
               moisturized they rub  19T07:

               paper and body paints
               for fun the cerave
               hydrating sunscreen
               is whiter than my
               white paint. I dont

               I am not dark skin,
               and I hate this
               sunscreen. I am a
               mixed type skin and
               it makes my skin feel
               dry. It takes a lot
               of rubbing for the
               white cast to go
               away, I hate it. I

                  I purchased
                  the CeraVe
                  Hydrating
                  Mineral
                  Suncreen with
                  SPF 50 for the
                  body. I read
                  on a website
                  that
                  recommended it
                  that it
                  &quot;uses
                  only zinc
                  oxide to
                  provide
                  protection
                  from the
                  sun...&quot;.
                  However, the
                  ingredients on
                  the tube
                  listed
                  titanium oxide
                  of 9% and zinc
                  oxide of 7%. I
                  expected these 2022-

                  Everyone is
                  different but
                  I have to say
                  this sunscreen
                  for me is the
                  best one so
                  far! I used to
                  use the Bare
                  Republic
                  mineral face
                  gel sunscreen.
                  and I really
                  like that one
                  a lot there
                  was no white
                  cast at all
                  with that one
                  my only issue
                  was it
                  didn&#39;t
                  play well with
                  some of my
                  other products
                  it would tend
                  to pill. so I
                  would have to
                  wipe away the
                  little pills
                  before I could
                  do anything
                  else and I was
                  always worried
                  about getting
                  all the
                  benefits from
                  it other than
                  that I loved
                  it! This does
                  have a strong
                  white cast but
                  I am very fair
                  skinned and
                  after I rub it
                  in I don&#39;t
                  see a
                  difference
                  neither does
                  my husband or
                  my kids or my
                  friends. It
                  doesn&#39;t
                  dry my face
                  out it
                  actually is
                  almost like a
                  moisturizer.
                  And I&#39;m
                  able to put on
                  my concealer
                  and mineral
                  powder
                  afterwards
                  without any
                  problem
                  whatsoever! I
                  don&#39;t
                  really wear
                  foundation
                  anymore as I
                  worked hard to
                  clear my skin
                  up and I&#39;m
                  very proud of
                  it so I just
                  use a little
                  bit of
                  concealer
                  under my eyes
                  and a few
                  little spots
                  here and there

                  some powder

                  mascara
                  eyebrows and
                  lip gloss and

                  to go for the
                  day! So for me
                  this is a good
                  sunscreen I
                  know everybody
                  is different
                  so everyone
                  has the right
                  to their
                  opinion not
                  everything is
                  meant for
                  everyone but
                  for me I have
                  to say this is
                  a very good
                  sunscreen and
                  I&#39;m very

                  I love this
                  one. My skin
                  is sensitive
                  and this does
                  not bother it
                  at all. The
                  glow and paler
                  look it gives
                  is very modern
                  and pretty.

                  I agree, this
                  sunscreen is
                  terrible!! It
                  will make
                  every dry
                  flake on your
                  face stand
                  out. It leaves
                  an odd
                  greasiness on
                  the face that
                  doesn&#39;t
                  absorb into
                  the skin. I
                  wore it to
                  work and
                  thought I had
                  done more than
                  enough to rub
                  it in. But
                  after I got
                  HOME I noticed
                  a white
                  streak. I
                  totally agree
                  about wanting
                  to wash your
                  face, I felt
                  the exact same
                  way. I&#39;ll
                  keep it and

                  I absolutely
                  love the
                  tinted version
                  spf 30 of
                  this. It is
                  good for those
                  that are
                  medium maybe
                  deeper tones
                  and it does
                  not pill under
                  makeup. As far
                  as Cruelty
                  free.. look
                  into the brand
                  Ceramedx. They
                  are basically
                  a cruelty
                  free, vegan
                  Cerave version
                  of this
                  product. This
                  Spring 2020,
                  they are going
                  to be coming
                  out with a
                  full face
                  line. As of
                  right now they
                  just have a
                  body cleanser
                  and
                  moisturizer.
                  They say that
                  they are for
                  the body, but

                  I really
                  regret buying
                  the CERAVE
                  sunscreen. I
                  wish I&#39;d
                  seen your
                  review before
                  buying it.
                  It&#39;s
                  impossible to
                  blend it, it
                  makes your
                  face white and
                  super flaky. I
                  really wanted
                  to love this
                  product
                  because of the
                  rich formula
                  but it&#39;s
                  almost
                  impossible to
                  use on your
                  face it makes
                  you look like
                  a flaky mime.
                  Will try using
                  it on my body
                  though still
                  not sure if it
                  will look ok.

                  sunscreen is
                  The Ordinary
                  Mineral UV
                  Filters SPF 30
                  with
                  Antioxidants.
                  It is the
                  first one I
                  ever used that
                  did not make
                  my face itch.
                  It works
                  really well
                  with their
                  foundation
                  too. I also

                  Watery

                  mineral
                  sunscreen, but
                  the first
                  chemical one I

                  You probably
                  have noticed
                  that I never
                  comment on
                  sunscreens.
                  It‚Äôs not a
                  priority me at
                  the moment
                  since I‚Äôm
                  unable to go
                  anywhere (due
                  to my health).
                  Lol, I didn‚Äôt
                  want you to
                  wonder, she‚Äôs
                  really into
                  skincare but
                  doesn‚Äôt wear
                  sunscreen.
                  <br>Did you
                  ever get the
                  goat milk
                  lotion/soap? I
                  actually
                  purchased from
                  a new (to me)
                  shop, and I
                  may like it
                  better. It‚Äôs
                  so fresh
                  because the
                  seller
                  actually made
                  it the night
                  before she
                  shipped it. I
                  guess she does
                  ‚Äúmade to
                  order‚Äù
                  usually, which
                  is awesome.
                  <br>I do try
                  to keep up on
                  sunscreens
                  though. Hoping
                  I‚Äôll need one
                  sooner than
                  later:         2019-

                   They are still selling this in
                   stores two years later! I just
                   purchased this today and came home
                   and put it on immediately. I
                   absolutely love the way this
                   blended into my light to medium
                   skin tone! It is moisturizing and
                   non-greasy like Dr. Dray mentioned.
                   I have tried for a while to find a
                   sunscreen I will be motivated to
                   use every day. With other formulas,
                   I would be consistent at first but
                   then end up skipping sunscreen
                   altogether because I would get      2022-

                   Hi Dr. Thanks for your video. I
                   tried this sunscreen and kind of
                   like it. It feels nice, the tint
                   isn&#39;t too bad and I like how it
                   smooths my complexion and
                   doesn&#39;t settle into my
                   wrinkles. However...I dont know why
                   everyone keeps saying this
                   sunscreen is not greasy. It is VERY
                   greasy/wet and takes forever to
                   dry. When you showed your face
                   after you put it on I could see how
                   wet and dewey it was on you. Can    2021-

                   I&#39;ve used this for 2 days,
                   yesterday over other moisturizer
                   and today under the moisturizer.
                   Today I noticed my face was
                   stinging all over using it first,
                   but both days I&#39;ve gotten a big
                   red stinging itchy spot on my left
                   cheekbone. Both times I&#39;ve put
                   the normal lotion I wear over it
                   and after couple hours it stops
                   stinging and fades away but rest of
                   face still feels funny.. That area
                   doesn&#39;t have any bump or
                   scaling prior to using it so not
                   sure why just that
                   spot....there&#39;s got to be
                   something there I just can&#39;t
                   feel or see. I&#39;m going to have
                   to give this to my daughter to use.
                   This was the first time I tried
                   this brand of sunscreen. Previously

                   I know CeraVe is not a makeup
                   company but it&#39;s ridiculous to
                   come out with a tinted sunscreen
                   that comes in literally only one
                   shade (and of course a very light
                   one). It doesn&#39;t make any sense

                   I&#39;ve been using this for about
                   a week now and love it. I did find
                   it is slightly darker than I would
                   like. I&#39;m pretty fair. However,
                   I just started mixing the sunscreen
                   with a foundation lightener that I
                   use and I like the result. I did
                   that for a couple days with regular
                   foundation on top but today I&#39;m
                   trying just the sunscreen and
                   lightener. I&#39;ve only tried one

                   Hi Dr Dray, what do you think of
                   mixing this sunscreen with a non-
                   tinted mineral sunscreen, and then
                   maybe it could lighten it up a bit?
                   And also, which formula would you
                   recommend to do that? Because I
                   know that sometimes mixing certain  2020-
                   formulas together can create a      05-

                   I HATED that other mineral
                   sunscreen. It didn‚Äôt glide on, you
                   had to rub and rub and then it
                   pilled up. I threw mine out. I may
                   try this, but I still like my

                   for all the great stuff you
                   recommend its such a game changer,
                   I bought this because I always have
                   a problem with sunscreen breaking
                   me out or looking chalky and saw
                   you liked it, My skin tone is
                   pretty medium because Im half black
                   but this blends into my skin so
                   well I can&#39;t even tell the
                   difference. So happy to find a
                   sunscreen that I don&#39;t hate to  2020-

                   Dr. Dray, when you put the CeraVe
                   spf 30 tinted sunscreen on your
                   face, I thought that color was not
                   so bad, but it was very shiny. (I
                   don&#39;t like matte cause it can
                   be dry &amp; uncomfortable,
                   instead, prefer a natural look.
                   Does that shiny look go away after
                   the lotion dries? It&#39;s hard to
                   tell from what I can see on this    2020-

                   I did not like this product. It was
                   quite oily feeling and made me
                   break out like crazy! <br>The tint
                   is also quite dark. Great for olive

                   I waited for the Cerave to restock
                   on Amazon so I could try it. I was
                   looking forward to trying it, the
                   Australian Gold tinted spf 50 and
                   the Cetaphil tinted spf. But this
                   disappointed me. The color was ok
                   but I never tried down! I sent it
                   back. I love the Australian Gold
                   tinted one. It dries but it maybe
                   to dry for some. The cetaphil was

                   I found this at my Walgreens in San
                   Francisco a few days ago. My skin
                   is light olive (Sandra Bullock or
                   Catherine-Zeta Jones) and it looks
                   great. Agree the texture is nice.   2020-

                   This just arrived in my Walgreens
                   so I bought it. I love tinted
                   mineral sunscreens. I have the
                   Australian gold one, la Rosche
                   Posay one and this one. I have
                   olive undertones so the tint kinda
                   blends in with my skin but I do
                   wish brands would actually come out
                   with different shades. The
                   Australian gold is actually my
                   favorite and hasn‚Äôt irritated my    2020-

                   I am an occasional make up wearer,
                   what would you recommend for
                   effective re-application of SPF

                   not re-apply my make up other than
                   a touch up. As someone with rosecea

                   applying SPF. However, removing and 2020-

                   Hi Dr Dray. Random question: is
                   your shirt in this video UPF
                   protective? I really appreciate the
                   design. If so, could you please     2020-
                   provide the details or a link for   01-
                   it? Thanks a lot. Have a great day  09T23:

                   My holy grail will always be the
                   Australian Gold tinted mineral
                   sunscreen SPF 50. It‚Äôs less than
                   $15 and it looks flawless. No white
                   cast or greasy look. It actually
                   has some coverage for those of us
                   who are used to wearing foundation. 2020-
                   I usually mix a small amount of BB  01-

                   Thank you, Dr Dray for all the time
                   and energy you give to these
                   videos. You have changed my life !
                   I am a 72 year old retired
                   professional woman who has
                   struggled with hundreds, if not
                   thousands of both open and closed
                   comedones on my face for the last
                   40 plus years with no success. I
                   gave up on dermatologists years ago
                   because none of them would
                   recommend a product line ( that
                   they did not sell ) In August 2019
                   I started using your recommendation
                   for no more foundation, no more hot
                   water cleanses, clean my skin only
                   at night and put my Cerave night
                   time moisturizer on over a wet face
                   after cleansing with a Cleanser by
                   Cerave. My skin is so smooth now,
                   so clear with good texture and
                   almost no comedomes - even in my
                   oily ‚ÄúT‚Äù zone. I LOVE the Cerave
                   tinted sunscreen SPF 30 reviewed
                   here. The shade is perfect for my
                   slightly yellow (warm) toned pale/
                   medium skin. The price is so
                   reasonable and it is also available
                   at my local drugstore. You are an
                   angel to provide this inside
                   information to the public at no
                   charge. I hope every good thing is

                   I think this will work for me. It

                   good maybe I will forgo foundation
                   and offset the cost. I have seen    2020-

                   valuable, honest information. We

                   I love the idea of tinted sunscreen
                   but they seem to oxidize a lot on
                   my skin. I don&#39;t know if
                   that&#39;s common. It would be
                   interesting to know if its the
                   product that get darker overtime or
                   if there is something within my     2020-

                   say this is more matte than the

                   actually if anyone need a sunscreen
                   that is (highly) water resistant as

                   video on the body lotion or cream

                   through most of your videos about
                   anti-aging and I did not see any
                   that was specific for the body.
                   Someone mentioned glycolic acid in
                   lotions for anti-aging, but in one  2020-

                   Love Cerave and use them

                   refer to some process that
                   transforms it to that odd number.

                   Happy New Year Dr. Dray! I have
                   over 60, dry rosacea skin and your
                   videos have been so helpful. I
                   would love a video on your
                   comparison of different tinted
                   sunscreens...I find all the choices
                   Elta MD offers very confusing. How  2020-
                   would this Cera Ve product compare  01-

                   I love the feel of Cerave products,
                   but they contain parabens. Whats
                   the deal with parabens? We hear so
                   much about hpw bad they are for
                   being estrogen mimicking, where
                   they have been found to cross the

                   subscribers of what is safe for
                   their skin and what isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm      2020-

                   Thanks for another informative

                   your videos a few weeks ago, but
                   wish I had seen them years ago.
                   I&#39;ve switched to the CeraVe
                   line of cleanser, moisturizers and
                   sunscreen. I&#39;m also applying my
                   moisturizer to wet skin. This is
                   the first winter that I haven&#39;t
                   had dry flaky skin. I&#39;m looking
                   forward to trying this tinted
                   sunscreen to help protect my skin

                   Hi dr dray, I have androgenetic
                   alopecia and tried to research many
                   clinics in london that help with
                   alopecia. I realised that most
                   clinics have a 6 months laser
                   treatment that also provides you
                   with monoxidile serum. I have been
                   told by the consultants that after
                   6 months i will not need to use
                   anymore lasers and all i need is
                   the monoxidile to maintain the
                   hair. One example of clinics like
                   this is Estehairmedical. Do you
                   think the option of using 6 month   2020-
                   laser treatment is more effective   01-

                   Happy New Year&#39;s Eve, Dr Dray!
                   I&#39;m so glad you reviewed this.
                   I&#39;ve been curious about it. I
                   have more of a yellow undertone so
                   I think this would work for me. I
                   can see me purchasing this in the
                   near future and hopefully they will 2020-
                   come out with more of a variety of  01-

                   Happy New Year, Dr Dray!! After
                   watching your vids regularly and
                   making some big changes to my skin
                   care routine, I can say my
                   sensitive, acne prone skin is
                   beginning to look a lot better. The
                   biggest changes I made to my
                   routine is simplifying my routine
                   using your recommended products. I
                   stopped using foundation to hide my
                   acne and hyperpigmentation. This
                   was a huge change for me bc I was
                   so ashamed of my acne. No more
                   toners, going fragrance free and
                   applying my moisturizer on wet skin
                   have made a big difference. Less IS
                   more. You finally talked me into
                   using sunscreen. I live in a rainy,
                   overcast area (and avoid the sun
                   like the plague) so I thought I
                   didn&#39;t really need it. You
                   taught me that it&#39;s not just
                   direct sun exposure that&#39;s
                   problematic. Thank you so much for  2019-
                   taking the time to make these       12-

                   My worry is the breakouts...
                   I&#39;ve been using the Purito and
                   the Biore spfs lately and both are
                   really good for my combo skin; but
                   the point is they&#39;re not to

                   I use the Elta MD UV physical
                   tinted and I love it. I also find
                   it annoying when the sunscreen rubs

                   Love your videos, Dr. Dray.
                   I&#39;ve been using Dr.
                   Denese&#39;s tinted day defense
                   cream with SPF 30. I like that it
                   has a matte finish and it&#39;s
                   fine both alone and under makeup.
                   Have you tried it yet? If you have
                   and you reviewed it, can you post a
                   link to it? Thank you! <a

                   Hi Dr. Dray. I ordered this on
                   Amazon and used it a couple times.
                   Aside from the color I do really
                   like it. I&#39;ve also been
                   watching your colloidal oatmeal
                   mask video and the video you did
                   regarding reducing waste that
                   mention colloidal oatmeal. I&#39;m
                   not said you could use it as a
                   cleanser and a moisturizer. So my
                   question is after you apply it with
                   water and the oatmeal do you have   2019-
                   to apply moisturizer on top or is   12-
                   that your moisturizer? Thank you    31T17:

                   videos, you have taught me a lot on

                   Could you help do a review on
                   Altruist Anti Redness and           2019-

                   wrinkle due to a small cut I had in

                   about tinted sunscreens this

                   I&#39;m looking for tinted
                   sunscreen with a higher SPF.
                   Ideally it wouldn&#39;t transfer    2019-

                 With this mineral
                 sunscreen you have to
                 take about half the
                 amount you are going
                 to use and work it up
                 on your fingers tips
                 before you apply and
                 you have to do 2
                 layers. You cannot
                 expect for this to
                 work for you if you
                 dont do this. Because
                 mineral sunscreens
                 always have some
                 white cast. You might

                 actually is fine for
                 me! i use it every
                 day, and use a little
                 bit. my skin is so
                 weird, if i ever use
                 something on my skin
                 that is paler than my
                 skin tone, it evens
                 out in a few minutes
                 bc my cheeks are
                 really sunkissed. it

                 Yup, I normally like
                 cerave products but
                 this one is so bad.

                 I always liked the
                 nutrogena clear face
                 sunscreen spf 30, I
                 have combo skin and
                 it‚Äôs really
                 hydrating. However if
                 your using a acne
                 treatment such as
                 salicylic acid, their
                 sunscreens will burn
                 like the dickens
                 especially when you
                 go for a higher spf.

                 It works really well
                 and it‚Äôs an awesome
                 sunscreen. It just
                 looks bad. I like the
                 body one for my body.
                 But the face one
                 looks and feels
                 awful. But it works
                 well and it doesn‚Äôt
                 break me out and it
                 doesn‚Äôt dry me out
                 and it‚Äôs also very
                 moisturizing. It just
                 looks
                 awful.<br><br>Edit:
                 but the tinted one
                 works amazing for me.
                 The color can be a
                 bit orange but it
                 sinks in after like
                 5-10 minutes. If you
                 have very fair skin

                 and was thinking of

                 I really love EltaMD
                 UV Clear sunscreen.
                 It&#39;s literally
                 the only one that
                 doesn&#39;t cause me
                 to breakout. I know
                 it&#39;s not good for
                 the ocean but I
                 don&#39;t ever go to
                 the beach. If I do,
                 I&#39;ll switch to a
                 mineral sunscreen     2020-
                 instead and then just 05-

                 I have been
                 using this for
                 a few weeks.
                 It looks good
                 at first, but
                 after a while,
                 I feel it
                 looks to dark/
                 orang-ish on
                 me (I am
                 rather fair).
                 I have been
                 mixing it with
                 another
                 sunscreen to
                 tone it down.
                 It is a bit
                 greasy at
                 first, but     2021-
