                                                               question. Using the correct
                                                               amount and both will give you
                                                               colour, so with fair skin use the
                                                               light one, if you must use one of
                                                               them... well the thing is that
                                                               tinted sunscreen is not like a

                                                               as you go outwards from the face,
                                                               no it has to be evenly spread out
                                                               on the entire face and that can
                                                               look pretty strange, unless you

                                                               and then maybe there is no need
                                                               to use a tinted sunscreen... You

                                                               only difference is the colour,
                                                               which usually is achieved by
                                                               adding Iron Oxides. Theoretically
                                                               does Iron Oxides protect somewhat
                                                               against UV-light but not in
                                                               reality because there will only
                                                               be added what&#39;s needed for
                                                               colour not for any UV-light
                                                               protection. They don&#39;t have

                                                               and you can&#39;t just add

                                                               sunscreen because it might split
                                                               etc. Adding tiny amounts of Iron

Mary Offiong          of colour? 👀 55:57Z     1     1
                                                               Hi Mary Offiong, thanks for
                                                               commenting. Interesting thought
                                                               but really, as my point is with
                                                               these coloured sunscreens, they
                                                               unfortunately rarely are suitable
                                                               for darker skin tones as it seems
                                                               the creators of them have lighter
                                                               skin tones in mind, being more or
                                                               less suntanned. Changing that
                                                               does not seem to go as
                                                               &quot;fast&quot; as with
                                                               foundation where finally
                                                               something seems to happen. With
                                                               the amount of sunscreen needed I
                                                               feel it&#39;s just not as
                                                               workable as if using a foundation
                                                               for colour (also in actual
                                                               applying process) and therefore I
                                                               think people have a tendency to
                                                               use to little, which is a problem
                                                               in terms of sun protection. As
                                                               such, I would say that a tint has
                                                               a purpose in mineral sunscreens
                                                               due to the white cast but then
                                                               there should be a tone for all
                                                               skin colours and not just darker
                                                               skin tones so it&#39;s not that
                                                               simple as to assume tinted sun
                                                               screens are only for coloured
                                                               skin, for though people, I
                                                               suppose, would say I&#39;m white,
                                                               a mineral sunscreen is white as
                                                               in white, so not nice on me
                                                               either, and no tint so far has
                                                               suited me. Tints for chemical
                                                               sunscreens does not really make

                                                               white cast to hide, and using it
                                                               to even out skin colour I feel is

                                                               Hi Gewelry Ploy, thanks for your
                                                               question. Well, looking at the
                                                               colour again and looking at
                                                               Google for Bhutan (I think that
                                                               is what you mean?) it seems it
                                                               could be okay, also thinking of
                                                               my Korean friends. The colour is
                                                               sort of yellow with a red tone
                                                               but not really orange as one
                                                               might think. Anyway, it&#39;s a
                                                               chemical sunscreen so really
                                                               there is no need for it to be
                                                               coloured as such and I don&#39;t
                                                               think it&#39;s a good substitute
                                                               visually for using foundation on
                                                               top. The Titanium Dioxide in the
                                                               product is listed as a colour
                                                               agent to lighten the Iron Oxides
                                                               that gives the colour but is not
                                                               there as an active ingredient, so
                                                               you could just as well use a non-

                                                               think you will find a tinted

                                                               Maybe find a tinted moisturiser

                      Great
                      review,
                      thank you.
                      Out of
                      curiosity,
                      what shade
                      is the
                      Bioderma one
                      you tried
                      on? It’s
                      available in
                      light and
                      golden. I
                      happen to be
                      waiting for
                      the light
                      shade to be
                      delivered,
                      but not sure
                      how light it
                      really is.
                      Apparently
                      golden is
                      far too dark
                      even on
                      medium skin
                      tones and it
                      oxidises
                      further. I
                      agree with
                      you about
                      the Avene
                      mineral
                      sunscreen,
                      it’s far too
                      muddy
                      looking on
                      the skin and
                      doesn’t
                      really dry

                      ends up
                      looking

                      Hi Jesper,
                      how do you

                                                               foundations are supposed to be.

                      The tint is
                      way too
                      intense.
                      There is no
                      way we can
                      put the
                      proper
                      amount (like

            I live in Honduras
            and have a darker
            skin tone,
            unfortunately here
            the misconception
            that only white
            people need
            sunscreen is very
            prevalent, so I
            only started using
            sunscreen like 3-
            4 days ago. This
            brand was the one
            with the highest
            SPF at the store I
            went to, so I got
            it. I&#39;m so glad
            to see some good
            reviews on it,
            since I was a bit
            scared it&#39;d
            turn out to be a
            shady product as it
            wasn&#39;t super
            expensive and       2021-

            Unfortunately I
            realized the
            sunscreen product I
            was using really
            didn&#39;t work out
            for me. I dunno
            exactly why since
            it worked well
            enough at first. I
            realized that
            photoderm max 100
            for some reason
            dried out my skin
            and made certain
            areas on my face
            breakout more so I
            stopped using it. I
            am currently using
            Mustela&#39;s
            hybrid sunscreen
            and my skin and I
            are loving it. It
            seems like my skin
            only responds well  2021-

            Hey! I know you’re
            against foundations
            with SPF in them
            because won’t apply
            enough with

            wondering with this
            photoderm AR SPF
            50+ won’t it also
            be too much tint
            when you apply the

            Okay, despite the
            whitecast I can see
            why Olena likes
            Bioderma&#39;s
            sunscreen now. It
            isnt too drying but
            it isnt too greasy
            either which is
            great for my dry
            and acne prone
            skin. Also it
            doesnt stings my
            eyes. Granted i
            only slightly dabs
            some around my eye
            sockets but still!

            real.....next time

            tint or im just
            staying with
            Sanosan suncream
            cuz it also has     2021-

            Hi Olena, thank you
            for this great
            video! I think they
            changed the formula
            of the bio derma AR
            tinted sunscreen
            and one of the
            ingredients now is
            HELIANTHUS ANNUUS
            (SUNFLOWER) SEED
            OIL. [BI 506]. I
            know you said that
            we should avoid
            oils in cosmetics.
            It s the last
            ingredient though.
            Is it still safe ?
            Also have you heard
            of bioderma minéral 2021-
            sunscreen? It has   02-

            Neutrogena

            one of the most

            apply elaborately,
            though. I learned
            not to put

            sunscreens. I am in
            the US and noticed
            that Bioderma
            doesn&#39;t have
            sunscreen in the
            US. Do you know how
            I can get my hands
            on some of their
            sunscreen? I am
            using their
            cleanser and
            moisturizer and
            again, I am

            Fortunately my skin
            never complained on
            Vaseline sunscreen
            lotion. Cheapest

            Hi Olena! Thank you
            so much for all
            your help ❤️
            <br>I just started
            using Bioderma
            Aquafluid SPF50,
            and I&#39;m having
            a small break out,
            just on the oily
            parts of my face.
            My skin is also
            very sensitive. Do
            you think the
            Vitamin E is the
            problem? I read
            that it has a
            comedogenic rate of
            3, and I see that
            most of the         2020-

            Hi Olena! I am very
            happy to see
            someone who loves
            Bioderma products
            as much as I do! I
            did notice that the
            Bioderma Photoderm
            AR SPF 50 Tinted
            Cream contains
            Hydrogenated
            Vegetable Oil and
            Soybean extract ...
            Do these
            ingredients cause
            clogged pores?      2020-
            Anyways, thanks for 03-

            Hello Olene, I was
            wondering what you
            thought I should
            use. I&#39;m 64, my
            skin is dry and
            sensitive. My face
            has changed some
            though a little
            oily and been
            having breakouts. I
            have a problem with
            sweating due to a
            health condition.
            If I wear liquid
            makeup, I sweat
            worse. I did get
            the Bioderma
            sensabic cleanser,
            etc. For the body I
            got the intensive
            lotion and the
            creme shower gel.
            Wondered if I would
            need the hydra gel  2020-
            moisturizer. Thanks 01-

            from my experience,
            I can use any type
            of sunscreen
            basically. Some
            ingredients in
            sunscreens can be
            quite comedogenic.
            But, the trick that
            I use to make my
            skin tolerable for
            any type of
            sunscreen is
            exfoliating. It
            helps to remove any
            dead skin cell that
            can be clogging my
            pores. I use
            chemical exfoliant
            like AHA. So, as
            long as I exfoliate
            regularly, I can    2019-

            hard to find a
            mineral or chemical
            sunscreen that 1)
            protects from UVA

            no added perfume

            Hello, <br>So
            I&#39;m looking for
            a sunscreen that is
            not tinted and
            basically
            doesn&#39;t appear
            if I wore it to
            school, is suitable
            to use with makeup
            and a moisture-like
            sunscreen since my
            face tends to get
            really dry after
            washing it.<br>I
            would really
            appreciate it if
            you helped me find
            the suitable one    2018-

              thank you so much
              for this !! i live
              in Canada so we have
              a good amount of
              euro-brand
              sunscreens (not
              exactly the same
              sunscreen lines, but
              definitely most of
              the brands
              themselves).
              it&#39;s so hard to
              get access to asian-
              brand sunscreens and 2022-
              we don&#39;t get a   04-

              sensitive 💔 vichy

              but they either
              discontinued it or
              reformulated it and
              I&#39;ve not tried
              it I&#39;m

              I don’t know if it’s
              available across all
              Europe but if it is
              where you live I
              would highly
              recommend the
              Bionike dry touch
              sunscreen. It comes
              in both spf 30 and
              50, it’s great no
              white cast,
              fragrance and
              alcohol free, nickel
              tested, sinks in
              quickly and it’s     2022-

              Hi Ramon! Have you
              tried spfs from
              ISDIN? In my opinion
              one of the best
              sunscreens in
              Europe! Their fusion
              water range is
              amazing! The adult
              version has
              fragrance

              the bioderma is
              nightmare bc it
              stings my eye soo
              badddd like, wearing
              it is fine. one some

              crying at random

              some day went by
              without pain lmfao

              im not careful or
              uses micellar water
              with cotton bad on

              The UVA rating is on

              bad. I tried one

              the Nivea mattifying

              way better than
              Bioderma with 0
              whitecast. The
              sunscreen with
              salicylic acid from
              Bioderma is not that
              unique. SVR has a
              SPF for acne prone
              skin and oily skin
              that features
              salicylic acid and
              gluconolacctone et

              the Bioderma
              Photoderm Max
              Aquafluid and
              I&#39;m personally
              happy with it.
              I&#39;m on accutane
              and others
              sunscreens have been
              burning my skin and
              making it red.
              <br>My sunscreen
              tube has the UVA

              I have used the
              Nivea one regularly
              for years on and
              off. I love the way
              if feels and it
              gives my skin a nice
              glow. Applying it
              around my eyes is
              fine, however - if I
              get hot and sweaty
              it gets into my eyes
              and burns like hell.
              The have a sensitive
              one that has no
              fragrance and is
              less matt but it
              does the same. I saw
              they have released a
              mineral one too, I

                I&#39;m confused about the PPD/UVA-PF on
                this sunscreen. They used to actually
                print the PPD on the box and it was 24.
                They don&#39;t include that on the
                packaging anymore, though. <br><br>Then, I
                saw an independent test and it was much    2022-
                higher. I wonder if that test was actually 04-
                the cream version, though. <br><br>I think 28T12:

                This sunscreen is really good. I&#39;ve
                never tan with this and my acne marks no
                longer get much hyperpigmentation.
                It&#39;s so gooood! <br><br>However, it
                stings my eyes like crazy. The kind of
                sting that makes you feel tired the entire
                day, that&#39;s what it gives. <br><br>I   2022-

                Although it is recommended to reapply
                sunscreen every 2 hours but what if you
                our using a high spf and ppd sunscreen
                even if it degrade through out the day
                wouldn’t it last longer than a lower spf
                like 30? So im curious to know you can     2021-

                Hey Sarah. GREAT review, as always. I
                REALLY REALLY REALLY appreciate that you
                test the pH of products. I was the first
                one to ask you to start doing that. So it
                means a lot to me that you actually read
                the comments and listen/reply/interact
                with your followers. Since you do the best
                reviews and you are so thorough, could you
                start telling/adding to your notes whether
                the sunscreen products you review irritate
                the eyes/burn the eyes? I have EXTREMELY
                EXTREMELY sensitive eyes, and most
                chemical sunscreens (apart from a few that
                I&#39;ve tried) work SOOOOOOOO well on my
                skin, but they burn my eyes, and it&#39;s
                VERY important to make sure you&#39;re
                getting the sunscreen around your eyes. So
                I&#39;ve completely switched to physical
                sunscreen. I&#39;d love to be able to use
                more chemical ones, especially from the
                UK. So, do you think that you could add
                into your notes whether these products     2021-
                sting/irritate the eyes? Thanks so much.   01-
                You&#39;re the best. I always love you,    18T20:

                Hello! I live in Cyprus and have very
                sensitive skin. It has been an absolute
                nightmare to find a sunscreen for my combo
                acne prone and sensitive skin that is in
                stock in Cyprus pharmacies. I have managed
                to find the bioderma one since almost all
                the la Roche posay ones have den. alcohol
                as top ingredient and here in Cyprus they
                dont really know what mineral sunscreen
                means yet so i am kinda stuck. I am kind
                of afraid since you mention it has two
                ingredients that clog pores, do you think
                they are highly comedogenic or should i go
                ahead and buy it? It is around 22-23 euro  2020-
                here and i can&#39;t return it so i dont   07-

                Great, in-depth review as always! Just
                used this sunscreen for the first time
                today after it had been sitting in the
                cupboard for 2 months (was trying to
                finish up my previous sunscreen first) and
                i had to pass it down to my mother ASAP!
                Which was a bummer since i was really
                looking forward to using this. Started
                burning my eyes the second i put it around
                the eye area and my eyes wouldn&#39;t stop
                watering for hours even after rinsing. 😔
                <br>Anyways, i just bought some more of my

                mineral but this seems like it’s got
                excellent protection and I’m having a hard
                time finding a mineral one I really like.  2020-

                PPD of 42? Wow that&#39;s excellent I
                didn&#39;t know that! Will have to
                reconsider this sunscreen then. I liked it
                but it looked a bit whitecasty on me, so
                that was the only downside but every
                invisible sunscreen I&#39;ve tried so far
                has been hella irritating and I felt it    2020-

                I used lots of sunscreens and it is my
                favorite so far. The finish is good, it
                doesn&#39;t peel of, it is light, it has
                really good filters for uva rays, and it

                I know you are very hard on US sunscreens
                that only contain Avobenzone but just
                remember that there are ways to stabilize
                avobenzone and make it last longer, I
                think the best way is through Octorylene
                but it has to be a certain ratio and
                higher percentage than Avobenzone itself.
                Still it is a bit of gamble, it isn&#39;t
                ideal and you don&#39;t know how long it
                lasts so I can see where your concerns are 2020-

                Great review Sarah, as always. To those
                who aren&#39;t aware. Alot of chemical
                sunscreens can irritate the skin (if
                you&#39;re sensitive) and alot of
                sunscreens harm marine life, such as coral
                reefs 🐠, dolphins 🐬, fish 🐟 etc. if you
                are wearing the sunscreen while in the
                ocean. If you care about this issue please
                try to avoid using following sunscreen
                ingredients (while in contact with the
                ocean): Oxybenzone, Octinoxate,
                Octocrylene, Benzophenone-1, Benzophenone-
                8, 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, Para-
                aminobenzoic acid (PABA), Nanoparticles

                they have similar names. Also Tinosorb M
                and Tinosorb S. Just remember that

                sunscreens using Tinosorb M don&#39;t have

                which also leaves a white cast, has to

                I wish I could get along with chemical
                filter because they are mostly very
                aesthetically pleasing with the textures
                and what not but doesn’t matter what
                filter it is, if it’s chemical I break
                out. Even for most sunscreens that have
                chemical &amp; physical filters. Like the

                When to apply sunscreen is so confusing!
                My understanding is chemical sunscreen
                needs to sink into the skin, so applying a
                moisturizer that has a film forming
                barrier ingredient like silicones (which
                most do), can prevent it from penetrating.
                On the other hand, if you apply
                moisturizer and makeup on top, that could
                weaken it. What I do is skip the
                moisturizer and use a chemical spf that is
                also a moisturizer, or even better, a
                moisturizing primer with SPF (ie. Emma
                Hardie Amazing Face Protect &amp; Prime
                SPF 30). I usually add some Drunk Elephant
                DBronzi drops for a bit of colour, and set
                it with and spf mineral powder.
                Dermatologist Youtuber Dr. Dray also
                suggested adding Dermablend Flawless
                Creator Liquid Foundation drops if you
                want more coverage, as that formula does
                not effect the efficacy of the
                SPF.<br><br>Mineral/physical SPF sits on
                top of skin, so when I use them, I do
                apply a moisturizer under it, and usually
                add a tint. I also use IT Cosmetics CC+
                cream SPF 50 (mineral), but you need to
                cake it on to get that coverage. If
                I&#39;m working outside I will use a thin
                layer of my Some By Mi Truecica Mineral    2020-

                Thanks for the review of this product and
                your reviews of other skincare products.
                My go-to sunscreen when I am out in the
                sun for extended periods is the Bioderma
                Photoderm Max SPF 50 (PPD 33). I get the
                large spray bottle version which is the
                most cost-effective since it&#39;s 400 ml
                (currently the price is $49.50) so I can
                use it for myself and my family. I&#39;ve
                been purchasing this product from a US e-
                tailer called <a href="http://

                not affiliated with them but wanted to
                share this with others because I have been
                happy with their service/products since
                they actually order directly from France   2020-

                SPFs that have added antioxidants are
                primarily for marketing purposes. SPF is
                meant to create a protective film/barrier
                and is NOT meant to actually penetrate
                into the deepest layers of the skin. So
                even if there were antioxidants added they
                wouldn’t technically be beneficial to the

                   Hi Dr. Dray, I just found your
                   channel and I am so excited to
                   watch your videos. Your videos
                   have wealth of information about
                   skincare &amp; skin conditions. I
                   started implementing the use of
                   sunblock on a regualr basis in my
                   skincare regimen. I noticed in
                   your morning regimen you layer
                   your sunscreens. Do you layer the
                   same 2-3 sunblocks every two
                   hours throughout the day or do    2018-

                   Thanks - how lucky can one be -
                   I&#39;ve just orderede the Nivea
                   and Biore sunscreens from Japan
                   when this shows up. Last week I
                   had a coupon code for a German
                   pharmacy I use and had no idea
                   what to buy. I googled this
                   Bioderma sunscreen, and voila -
                   1st hit - my German pharmacy :).
                   So I&#39;ll try this as well - I
                   thought the Shiseido was my
                   winner, but how can I know,
                   without checking the others to
                   know for sure 😉. I like the feel  2018-
                   of the Shiseido, but it smells    01-

                   I use the Jamberry nail wraps
                   when I (rarely now) do my nails.
                   I like that they are such fun
                   designs and don’t require dry
                   time or have the horrid smell.
                   But they do require a bit of
                   practice and technique before you
                   get good at applying them. They

                   Are they effective at all? Also
                   would you mind telling us about   2018-

                   Dr Dray,<br>Can you say a few
                   words about hyperplasia of the
                   sebaceous glands and preventative
                   care? I thought they were
                   remnants of chicken pox scars
                   only to find out differently. Is  2018-
                   this an autoimmune process? Can   01-

                   There is a website called <a

                   that have all of the European
                   sunscreens. Awesome customer
                   service. Have been using them for
                   years. My personal fave is the
                   LaRoche Posay 50plus Lait. But
                   you place your order, and every
                   Sunday evening they order them
                   from Europe to ensure freshness.  2018-
                   Highly recommend if you are       01-

                   I have been looking through your
                   videos to see if you had used/
                   reviewed a moisturizer that I
                   found online, available at
                   Target. It is Alba Hawaiian
                   Refining Aloe &amp; Green Tea
                   Oil-Free Moisturizer- 3oz. The
                   more I read about it and many
                   other of the Alba products, the
                   more interested I become. Of      2018-

                   the ornaments off and put them
                   away. I&#39;m gonna keep it there

                   I was wondering I use a facial
                   oil and is it best to apply it
                   before a moisturiser or after?
                   <br><br>Also, I have pigmentation
                   under my eyes which I was born
                   with because I&#39;m South Asian
                   and have darker skin. Is there
                   anything you&#39;d recommend to
                   fade it or is that impossible as  2018-

                   Yes, Doc...my favorite sunscreen
                   is Daylong from Switzerland and
                   uses Tinosorb.  I love it also
                   because it doesn&#39;t sting when
                   I apply it around the eye area.
                    Wish we could get it here in the
                   US, have to either bring it back
                   from a visit or have someone      2018-

                   Hi Dr. Dray! I love your videos.
                   I was recently put on a
                   medication to clear my skin that
                   I had a reaction to and broke out
                   really, really badly. I have
                   stopped the medication and was
                   put on a different plan, and
                   it&#39;s starting to heal, but do
                   you have any estimate on if it
                   should clear faster if it was
                   just a reaction? Or will it still 2018-
                   take the same length of time? I   01-

                   Thank you for this review! Q and
                   A suggestion? PMLE! Personally, I
                   have used so many kinds of
                   suncreams, covered up most
                   exposed skin and limited direct
                   sun exposure during the warmer
                   months or on holiday, however, I
                   invariably get it every time.
                   Thank you for always keepin it

                   Hey Dr. Dray, I was wondering
                   what your thoughts are on the
                   Corsx BHA Blackhead Power Liquid.
                   I rarely get acne (just one
                   pimple every couple of months)
                   but my nose and chin area are
                   roughly textured with large pores
                   plugged with white stuff. Would
                   you recommend salicylic acid? I
                   have been using the Paula&#39;s   2018-
                   Choice 2% BHA liquid but it       01-

                   Canada also has both Tinosorbs in
                   its Bioderma sunscreens and has
                   for years and so does LaRoche
                   Posay and Avene. Also, up to 5 %
                   percent Avobezone is allowed here
                   combined with Titanium or Zinc
                   oxide or Tinosorb. It&#39;s crazy
                   that in the US all you can have
                   is 3 % percent Avobenzone and
                   it&#39;s not allowed to be
                   blended with Zinc or Titanium
                   dioxide. What is going on with

                   a great sense of humor!  Can you

                   Did you like the feeling on your
                   skin that Bioderma aquafluide
                   gives? I didn&#39;t :( Problem
                   for me was that slightly tacky
                   feeling and this mat effect that
                   somehow leaves something on my
                   skin, something similar to some
                   extra fine micro powder but I
                   feel it and I do not that
                   feeling. And it comes into my
                   fine lines so in time I see the
                   white marks around my lips and on
                   my forehead.. I really try to put
                   enough cream onto my face so
                   maybe that is the problem, maybe
                   I put far too much. How did you
                   feel this cream? I tried almost
                   all of the spf creams and fluids
                   that we have hear in my country
                   ( all bioderma&#39;s, all
                   avene&#39;s, all from la roche
                   and SVR, aderma, Roc, all eucerin
                   spf products and so many of spf
                   face creams...). I cannot find
                   the one that I enjoy. :(((( My
                   skin is combination, with
                   hormonal acne. The best sensory
                   feeling gave me eucerin fluid spf
                   30 that I think you don&#39;t
                   have it in usa. It is with
                   tinosorb S also and is so light
                   on the skin that I cannot feel it
                   ( and has alcohol..). The second
                   best is a new sunscreen from
                   Greece, the brand name is
                   Frezyderm. I will send you the
                   link. <a href="https://

                   face-spf-50/</a> That thing is in
                   silicones and you absolutely do
                   not feel it or see it on your
                   skin because as it is totally mat
                   and invisible. I would be so
                   happy if you could comment the
                   ingredients list of this
                   sunscreen. I would happily
                   provide you with that info :
                   ) What I found out for now is
                   that unfortunately it i not so

                   Hi Andrea, yes the sunscreen
                   gives us an oily unnatractive
                   look, specially if we have oily
                   skin, we use it because protects
                   our skin of a lot of problems,
                   begining with cancer, more
                   dangerous than the greasy
                   appearance, but other way we
                   wouldn&#39;t put it on our faces,
                   I hope we can buy sunscreens that 2018-
                   don&#39;t have these unappealing  01-
                   problems in a next future. Thanks 06T19:

                   Hi Dr. Dray, I have a quick
                   question to ask: I know you are
                   vegan and are very mindful of the
                   things you put &quot;inside your
                   body&quot; but I don&#39;t see
                   the same approach when it comes
                   to beauty products or the         2018-
                   &quot;outside of your body&quot;. 01-
                   I would love to know your take on 06T18:

                   Have you tried Starbucks Italian
                   Roast? They dont call it
                   &quot;express&quot;o but for all
                   extents and purposes it is! It is
                   very dark and stroooooong! I love
                   dark, strong coffee but that one  2018-

                   Your mom&#39;s nails look very
                   nice! I&#39;m curious about your
                   experience with the Essie TLC
                   polish. I&#39;m addicted to nail
                   polish and the Essie TLC
                   &quot;treatment&quot; is my very
                   favorite since it requires no
                   base coat or top coat and
                   actually benefits the health of
                   my nails. Unlike other
                   treatments, it doesn&#39;t cause  2018-
                   them to chip or peel. Hope you    01-

                   The Geezer and I used to
                   subscribe to Gevalia - I think we
                   got 2 boxes a month. We never
                   tried the espresso - just the
                   regular coffee. We really loved
                   the flavor - mild, but complex.
                   Ultimately gave up the            2018-
                   subscription due to the desire to 01-
                   try other coffees as well. Happy  06T17:

              I like this spf a lot even
              though it does leave a bit of a
              cast, but I usually top it with
              a tinted mineral spf to negate
              that. This is actually available
              in Canada in store because
              we&#39;ve approved Tinsorb S and
              Tinosorb M in spfs which is
              great! I do notice if I wear

              I tried the ultraceuticals SPF
              30 mattifying sunscreen and omg
              it actually irritated my skin!
              I&#39;m so bummed, I also
              don&#39;t think it&#39;s matte,
              it definitely isn&#39;t very
              shiny or as shiny as many other
              can be but I think it still
              leaves a bit of shine and it is
              definitely not a glow, looks
              more like grease, it&#39;s a bit
              of oily sheen, but like I said,
              not as bad as many others, it
              has essential oils and a citrusy
              scent, it has 2-3% nicainamide
              as well. The citrus scent is
              light and didn&#39;t bother me,
              it does dissipate quickly. But I
              am a bit annoyed I spent a lot
              of money on it and it didn&#39;t
              work, also didn&#39;t provide
              the matte finish it promised!
              You might end up liking it
              because you have dry skin. I
              don&#39;t know what bothered my
              skin, if it&#39;s one of the
              active ingredients or something
              in the base formula. But the
              active ingredients in this
              formula are 5% avobenzone, 4%
              ensulizole 3% octocrylene, 2%
              tinosorb s and 2%
              octinoxate.<br><br>To sum it up,
              it irritated my skin and I
              didn&#39;t like the finish it
              left because I have oily skin, I
              don&#39;t think it leaves a
              matte finish and I don&#39;t
              think it is
              &quot;mattifying&quot;.<br><br>I

              maybe it has corn starch to
              absorb excess oil? idk xD but I
              think they include 3 different
              oil absorbing powers in the
              formula? Also the very strong    2020-

           I love this
           sunscreen, I
           think this is my
           new holy grail
           ( though
           I&#39;ve been
           only using it
           for 4 days now)!
           When I first
           used it though,
           I accidently got
           a bit near my
           tearduct, it was
           fine for a while
           and made me tear
           up after 30
           minutes, and I
           stupidly rubbed
           my eyes even
           more – which
           meant more
           crying. Aside
           from tears, my
           nose felt stuffy
           and runny too. I
           had to go to the
           supermarket
           later and my
           mask can&#39;t
           keep up with how
           much snot I had
           lol (sooo
           embarrasing).
           Because I really
           want to like it
           because it&#39;s
           quite expensive,
           I used my make
           pr:em Blue Ray
           Sun Fluid around
           my eyes while
           using this, it
           was great.
           Yesterday, I
           felt lazy to
           apply a mineral
           sunscreen around
           my eyes first.
           So, I carefully
           applied it
           around my eyes!
           After
           application, I
           washed my hands
           and avoided
           touching my
           face. After 15
           minutes, I
           applied
           Innisfree No
           Sebum powder, so
           the sunscreen
           wouldn&#39;t
           move. Wow, it
           was perfect, no
           eye stinging
           throughout the
           day, and with    2021-

           In the defense
           of this
           sunscreen: the
           slight white
           cast dissapears
           on its own after
           some minutes
           without rubbing.
           2. It&#39;s ZERO
           comedogenic,
           which is almost
           impossible to
           find and 3. The
           protection is
           really great in
           constrast with
           other
           controversial
           products. Plus:  2021-

                                                          slight discomfort
                                                          to my eyes but it
                                                          was alright, it

                                                          took a while to
                                                          blend in and left a

           So, I&#39;ve used
           this sunscreen
           but where I live
           it says that it
           is water
           resistant and it
           has a more watery
           consistency
           ( fluid like )
           It&#39;s not
           greasy but at the
           same time it
           wouldn&#39;t feel
           great for people
           who have oily
           skin, ( I have
           Combo skin )
           it&#39;s working
           for me till now,
           sometimes when
           wearing a mask it
           rubs off and it
           makes your skin
           looks flaky and
           you need to
           reapply, I need
           to double cleanse
           for it to be
           removed
           completely off of
           my face. I would
           give this
           sunscreen 4/
           5 stars for
           texture and 5/
           5 stars for UVA
           protection ( PPD
           42 vivo ) the
           white cast looks  2021-

           I know that this
           is a very good
           sunscreen for a
           lot of people but
           I have not had a
           good experience
           with it. It is
           smooth on its
           own, but when I
           apply it onto my
           skin it dries out
           too quickly and
           turns sticky,
           which makes it
           hard to spread
           around without
           using excessive
           force. That way I
           tend to damage my
           skin. If I put a
           little bit more
           so it spreads
           easier then it
           becomes too wet
           and just forms
           like a thick
           layer of product
           sitting on my
           skin and clogging
           my pores. I also
           refrain from
           using it close to
           my eyes because
           it travels down
           with sweat and
           stings my eyes
           really bad.
           Protection wise
           this is of course 2020-
           a great one. I’ll 12-
