                I watched your review
                just a day after
                purchased this laptop.
                No regret except at the
                brightness of the       2021-
                screen. I think it is   09-
                too dim and a bit hard  09T08:

                Hi there! Great video.
                I am probably going to
                buy this Lenovo E14
                Gen2 with i7 11th gen,
                16GB Ram and MX450
                graphics card but the
                issue is 14 inches. I
                haven&#39;t used any 14
                inches laptop before so
                do you think the screen
                is too small or is it
                considered to be
                normal? I am going to
                study CS this year and
                I am assuming this
                laptop with high specs
                (intel i7 and discrete
                graphics card) should
                be okay for me for 4    2021-
                years. I would be happy 08-
                if I can get an answer. 30T14:

                                                                         good sweet spot of screen

                                                                         inch laptops you do feel as

Mr. Biplob      Please E15-Gen2 review  01:54Z     0     0
                Hello.<br>I bought this
                laptop. I notice that
                on my laptop, the
                screen has no
                magnet.<br>So when I
                close the computer, and
                put it vertically (in a
                bag for example), the
                screen tends to open
                slightly. You too? Or
                have you noticed that
                your screen has a
                magnet that allows you  2021-

                Hi Mr.
                BsianDad!<br>Question:
                In this one can we put
                a normal USB-C docking
                with power and hdmi
                ports and plug a
                monitor in it? <br>My
                previous laptop was an
                IdeaPad s340 and
                doesn&#39;t support
                video over the USB-
                C port. Something
                related to
                &quot;DisplayLink&quot; 2020-

                Thanks for your patience all, I got
                in contact with Lenovo regarding
                about the display dimming and here is
                the official word, thank you to
                Lenovo ANZ team for the
                clarification. <br>Lenovo response -
                <br>With respect to display
                brightness, it‚Äôs hardcoded in the
                Thinkpad E14 G2 AMD BIOS to balance
                battery life and performance. One
                component that drives battery
                consumption is the LCD brightness.
                Therefore when running in Battery
                mode, the display will dim to some
                extent to get back to a ‚Äúbalance
                battery life/performance‚Äù status.
                <br>
                <br><br>However there‚Äôs a brightness
                adjustment in AMD Radeon settings
                that will enable you to manually
                overwrite the selection.<br><br><a

                Good Review. These E and L series
                ThinkPads have extremely pathetic
                battery and its batteries are prone
                to losing its capacity over time.
                Check thoroughly before buying. In
                this price range the LG Gram has
                phenomenal battery. ThinkPad&#39;s
                main advantage is their keyboards but

                Is it just me or did everyone face a
                problem with the boot? I bought this
                laptop and the moment I turned it on,
                I ran into the a boot loop. At first
                I thought that it was because the OS  2021-
                wasn&#39;t installed so I got my USB  10-

                I wonder if you can share with me
                some information regarding the model/
                spec of SSD storage since the model I
                found only has 256 GB and 8 GB DDR4.
                DDR4 3200 MHz I can find them on      2021-
                amazon. But I get confused on the SSD 02-
                storage. Does WDS500G3X0C or          16T05:

                Great review with everything I need
                to know! I think I&#39;m going to go
                with one of these. I&#39;m not a
                business user, but a home user that
                likes to tinker with things like some
                music production and digital drawing,
                and some legacy gaming where I
                don&#39;t need a majorly powerful
                GPU, although it looks like the
                integrated Radeon in the Ryzen 4000
                series is nothing to sneeze at
                either. My reason for honing in on a
                Thinkpad though, is that I value the
                durability and upgradeability, as I
                usually keep my laptops for 5 years
                or more, plus with this E series
                model it doesn&#39;t really cost much
                more than a lot of consumer laptops
                with Ryzen and similar specs. I can
                take the &quot;cost cutting&quot;
                measures of the E series as I really
                don&#39;t need that many ports (nice
                that this still has full sized HDMI
                and a flip-down Ethernet jack that
                doesn&#39;t need a dongle though),
                and it also loses the 2 signature
                silver hinges from the L series and
                up, but I think this one actually
                looks cleaner. Another reason is
                nostalgia. The first laptop I bought
                with my own money after doing odd
                summer jobs as a kid was a somewhat
                gutted IBM-made Thinkpad from circa
                1997 used on eBay, I forget the exact
                model. I found all the missing
                components, like a refurbished
                battery, AC adapter, RAM, a decently
                large hard drive, a PCMCIA modem card
                (family was still on dail-up ugh) and
                the CD ROM drive (it had one of those
                hot-swappable drive bays, remember
                those? I later got the floppy disk
                one too) and installed Windows XP
                which was current at the time, and
                had a really decent computer for
                cheap. Other than a number of modern
                developments like thin-ness and
                display bezel size, the basic shape
                and design of these newer Lenovo
                Thinkpads really hasn&#39;t changed
                all that much. I&#39;m excited to
                mess around with the TouchPoint nib
                too, as I got really good with it on
                my childhood Thinkpad because it only
                had the TouchPoint as an on-board
                pointing device and no touchpad. That
                webcam is kinda meh, but looks
                perfectly serviceable for video
                calls, and it looks like it has
                decent low light performance too.
                It&#39;s no worse I think that the    2020-
                webcams in MacBooks that cost twice   12-
                as much, I think they still use 720p  30T12:

                       Never buy any LEVENO PRODUCT.. They are thieves.<br><br>I bought a laptop Levono Legion Y540
                       on Jan 1, 2020. But within 6 months it started giving me blue screen problem. Due to covid19
                       and home from home situation, I could not send laptop for repair. On November 30th, when my
                       work was little off, I called the customer care for the service. On calling Lenovo for 2
                       months, regularly every week, I got nothing. Finally, I heard from Lenovo when I decided to
                       write to ¬†Better Business Bureau, and a technician was sent to my house for the repair.
                       However, after the repair is done, I figured out that the Lenovo has stolen my 1 TB SSD and
                       replaced with 256 GB SSD. I prefer to use word &quot;stolen&quot; with a reason, which I
                       believe will be clear later. I immediately sent an email to the Case Manager, Executive
                       Customer Care of Lenovo about the same, and she offered me the $300 for that and rejected to
                       give me back my 1 TB SSD.<br><br>I decided to buy Lenovo with 1 TB SSD for a reason and did
                       not go with 256 GB SDD in the first place. My work requires me 1 TB SSD that is why I paid
                       $1500 for the laptop and there is no way I will settle with 256 GB SSD. Ever since my SSD is  2021-
                       replaced, I have not been able to perform my work and that has caused me too much of stress   05-

                       independently while we cannot move our souls or spirits independently of our body.<br><br>---

                       I rejoice that you found a laptop that seems to work for you! Personally, I noticed some
                       things about this Nano which were not so enticing for me. First, Lenovo rates the weight at
                       2.19 lbs for the touch screen model (and 2.27 if it has WWAN) so it isn&#39;t really under 2
                       lbs. Second, the display is only 2K which is a deal-breaker for me (I&#39;d rather get the X1
                       Carbon at 2.4 lbs with a 4K display). Right now I am watching--and writing--on a new Samsung
                       Tab S7+ (1.3 lbs) which has a 120 HZ Super AMOLED 3K display and weights considerably under 2
                       lbs even with a keyboard. For photo pros the higher resolution is just too important to
                       consider weight as the biggest selling feature. Also, with any lightweight device, having pen
                       input is so sweet and adds tremendous value (note taking; drawing; letter writing, etc.) that 2020-

                       I&#39;ve got a ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6, and although there&#39;s a lot that I really love about
                       it, there are a few things about it that soured it for me. I found that when using it on my
                       lap or my desk pad the fan intake gets blocked and it ends up getting hot and loud, I really
                       hate that they put that tiny air intake there. I also noticed that if you plug it into a 60w
                       charger while using it, the top left of the keyboard gets uncomfortably hot because of the
                       fast charging. Finally the USB C ports feel really mushy and weak, and a plastic bit even
                       broke off the inside of one of the ports a couple of months after getting it. I ended up      2020-

Andrei Taranu          this excitement about the keyboard is not going to age well                                   36:04Z     0     0
                       i used the ipad pro for a year...then added the keyboard... i found it beefy and heavy...if
                       it had a dual boot with macos then i&#39;d accept it cos i have best of both worlds BUT
                       it&#39;s just pados which is for me is still a glorified iphone with some &quot;pro&quot;
                       apps. I&#39;ve actually just go rid of it because i found it so frustrating to use - i&#39;d
                       start something on it but have to finish it off on my imac... it&#39;s great for drawing but  2020-
                       when it&#39;s pushing into the ¬£1000+ bracket with the keyboard - it should be doing so much  10-
                       more... it feels outdated due to it&#39;s limitations<br><br>I&#39;m going back to a laptop   04T14:

              Hey nice
              video.<br>I m
              looking to buy
              this laptop but
              confused between
              ryzen 5 5500u
              and ryzen 7
              5700u. There is
              67$ difference
              between the two.
              I am a casual
              user but looking

              Very helpful
              video....thank
              you! Can you
              please confirm
              that the memory
              really is
              running in dual
              channel mode,
              such as looking
              at the memory
              page of CPU-Z.
              Since the memory
              you buy for the
              SODIMM is
              unlikely to have
              the same specs
              as the soldered
              memory chips, it
              is kind of a
              crap shoot if
              the memory
              subsystem will
              really be able
              to run in dual
              channel mode.
              But if this
              Crucial memory
              you bought works
              for you in dual  2022-
              channel mode, I  04-

                  Ohh, I see a downgrade in the
                  keyboard department from E480 that
                  I own: in E480, you just pop out
                  left and right touchpad buttons,
                  unscrew two bolts that are hidden
                  under these and pop out the
                  keyboard, place a new one in and
                  that&#39;s it - and I had to
                  replace it like that when it got
                  damaged very easily when I wanted
                  to clean it with a damp (maybe
                  slightly too damp) cloth;
                  fortunately I got a new one mailed
                  in from Lenovo authorized service
                  for free, no questions asked. Here
                  I see the keyboard protrudes from   2021-
                  below of the top cover, so          01-

                  Good review bro.If I hadn&#39;t
                  seen this computer I can almost
                  have paid $375 more to another
                  laptop.I ordered this.I guess it
                  will come 1 or 2 days. My only
                  concern when I buying was the
                  quality of the video card.I hope
                  it&#39;s good quality, I don&#39;t
                  know much about amd&#39;s graphics
                  card.I liked all the other
                  features.I&#39;m Electronics and
                  Communication Engineering Students
                  and I believe this laptop will be a 2020-
                  good choice for me.<br><br>Thank    10-

                  Great review!!<br>I have a question
                  about the keyboard. Is it a backlit
                  keyboard or is it like the L480
                  that isn&#39;t                      2020-
                  backlit?<br><br>I&#39;m a ThinkPad  10-

             &amp; MSI modern 14 b10mw

             on i5 10 th gen. In ThinkPad e14,
             FHD Anti-glare TN display is used,
             whereas in msi FHD IPS 60 hz
             display is in use. MSI also claims

             Hi bro, I have the same laptop.
             Been using it for the past 5
             months. Awesome performance. Only
             area of issue I have is the battery
             degradation. Currently, it has
             reduced to 42.33 Wh compared to the
             initial 45 Wh, while checking on
             the lenovo vantage application.

             mine, his ideapad with 35 Wh        2021-
