Nice sunscreen but pricey and makes face little shiny too
its good for dry skin
I like the high UVA protection that the suncream offers but it does give that whitecast, especially in the eyebrows and beard which looks quite bad. Also, sometimes it peels so bad that you regret applying it in the first place.
This sunscreen is extremly good at sun protection. The only thing which i doesnt liked was it leaves white patches on skin after applying
It has no scent so that's the best part actually product seems to be good but my skin just reacted little different and when informed the seller was kind enough to respond quick and resolve.
Superb.  Go for it
It’s a good product recommended by my dermat, but needs to apply in intervals. Depends on skin type. Works perfect for combination skin.
Great packaging, Trusted and reliable technology for very high sun protection and this product is better in every aspect than the previous one, truly worth the extra 200INR, doesn't burn or sting in the eye for me, cream to fluid consistency, Provides one of the highest UVA Protection in the market.I hope they come out with bigger volume packaging, that would be perfect.
I bought this after lot of deliberation and I am glad I did. I have very very dry skin so the sun cream I bought in past were sticky and would give me a feeling of sweaty, which was not a great feeling. I used this (almost finished) and I wouldn't mind a little bit of fragrance but this has none which is okay. It gives white cast after one spread and if you keep evenly spreading the cream on the face the white cast is gone (in few circular motions).  All in all I found this cream amazing.

I am satisfied with bioderma SPF 50. It actually protects from harsh UV rays.

Very nice productdry touch texture is awesome

It’s really good! Would be perfect if the price were cheaper or the size were bigger. My skin is sensitive. Wrong product will irritate it, cause acnes, or worse, make it darker. But this one feels so light, doesnt have any scent, and so far I dont have any problem using it. It doesnt leave much whitecast tooI am going to buy one more now since we’re going to beach soon.

I do recommend this sunscreen because it gives light and glossy finish to your skin.I think 50spf is suitable for indian skin.After applying this within few minutes sweat is on ,so tap with ur finger or with cotton fabric it will set quickly.This sunscreen will work great in winters
I purchased this sunprotection cream for my sister as she has very sensitive skin. This is a nice cream and has good texture n is light in weight. It has nicely suited my sisters skin type. It is more water base n less greasy.
I am very particular about sunscreens, because I have combinstin skin so I always prefer non-sticky sunscreen and trust me it is one of them and my skin is feeling fresh  and breathing otherwise I always need wipe it off.
I love all bioderma products as it suits my sensitive skin. This sunscreen is also great, provides good sun protection (spf 50+) and is water resistant too. Good product overall.
I am giving this review just after using the product only from a week and it was wonderful. It was absolutely ultra matt . Its spread is good as i took only 3 or 4 drop all over my face. It is completly perfect for all type of skin eother men can also use. Also i dnt feel sweat on face after applying it
Good for dry skin
Good product, will recommend it.
Very bad packaging and product looks like a copy of the origin. Doesn't look genuine.
Bioderma spf50 phptoderm max cream completely suits my skin, smells good, light on skin, non-greasy and perfectly absorbs im the skin. Perfect for all those who drives bikes like me Overall nice product
