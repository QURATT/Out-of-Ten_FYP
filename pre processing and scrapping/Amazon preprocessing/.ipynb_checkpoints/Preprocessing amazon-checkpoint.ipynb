      "nice sunscreen but pricey and makes face little shiny tooits good for dry skini like the high uva protection that the suncream offers but it does give that whitecast especially in the eyebrows and beard which looks quite bad also sometimes it peels so bad that you regret applying it in the first placethis sunscreen is extremly good at sun protection the only thing which i doesnt liked was it leaves white patches on skin after applyingit has no scent so thats the best part actually product seems to be good but my skin just reacted little different and when informed the seller was kind enough to respond quick and resolvesuperb  go for itits a good product recommended by my dermat but needs to apply in intervals depends on skin type works perfect for combination skingreat packaging trusted and reliable technology for very high sun protection and this product is better in every aspect than the previous one truly worth the extra inr doesnt burn or sting in the eye for me cream to fluid consistency provides one of the highest uva protection in the marketi hope they come out with bigger volume packaging that would be perfecti bought this after lot of deliberation and i am glad i did i have very very dry skin so the sun cream i bought in past were sticky and would give me a feeling of sweaty which was not a great feeling i used this almost finished and i wouldnt mind a little bit of fragrance but this has none which is okay it gives white cast after one spread and if you keep evenly spreading the cream on the face the white cast is gone in few circular motions  all in all i found this cream amazingsatisfiedi am satisfied with bioderma spf  it actually protects from harsh uv raysgoodvery greasy tends to break out  i had smooth skin lost d texturei have been using for  months nowexcellent stuffas if applied powder paste that will melt with just touch of waterwasted moneysubmitted same on their official websites but no replyvery nice productdry touch texture is awesomedefinitely buying it againits really good would be perfect if the price were cheaper or the size were bigger my skin is sensitive wrong product will irritate it cause acnes or worse make it darker but this one feels so light doesnt have any scent and so far i dont have any problem using it it doesnt leave much whitecast tooi am going to buy one more now since were going to beach soon it has no scent so thats the best part actually product seems to be good but my skin just reacted little different and when informed the seller was kind enough to respond quick and resolvesuperb  go for
