Thank you Maybelline foundation for finding me I had given up wearing foundation years ago after Clinique stopped making their sports makeup foundation Maybelline for normal to dry skin is just as high a quality as Clinique It may even be better because the other car no my allows me to buy more shade variationsNow I own several variations of colors ranging from porcelain and ivory to nude buff considering which part of my face gets the foundationI am a visual artist painter so this makeup thing should be easy for me The issue has been a battle for economy together with quality With Maybelline I have found both economy and qualityThank you Amazon and Maybelline ,0.084,0.056,0.86,0.5106,Positive
I love it Doesnt clog my pores and my skin is GLOWING I do not like the thick matte type foundation and this is very light and doesnt feel heavy Ive used many many MANY foundations in my life and this is by far my favorite of all time,0.135,0.04,0.825,0.7261,Positive
I love how this makeup feels on my skin I have very sensitive skin and other products cause me to break out I am 35yrs old and have rosacea and I get flare ups when using other products this product works great for my skin and is my go to I highly recommend,0.198,0.0,0.802,0.902,Positive
I purchased this foundation in fair porcelain to mix with a make up I have  like in medium and it worked  just fine for that Other than that this shade is for the exceptionally exceptionally pale A hard to find shade when its what you seek but this would look too chalky and pale on most people,0.087,0.027,0.887,0.3246,Positive
I love how smooth this foundation is It literally gives you full coverage from the first application not to mention it last all day  make sure you put on primer Definitely one of my Go Tos and fave ,0.268,0.0,0.732,0.9022,Positive
I was looking for a foundation to cover my super red skin due to constant rosacea flare ups I also have textured skin with large pores Im not a professional when it comes to makeup and I have spent entirely to much money trying products that just didnt work for me  But I took a chance on this one because of the super affordable price So beyond happy that I did My skin feels hydrated looks dewy and it covers my redness without feeling like I need to apply half of the bottle Glad I tried something other than a matte finish as I now know its just not compatible with my skin I do not use a setting powder just a setting spray And finally I found something that makes me feel confident enough to take a selfie without a filter I will definitely buy more of this foundation,0.157,0.046,0.796,0.9636,Positive

I must rave about this foundation I normally put on powder and call it good The other day I decided to give this a try and I am impressed We live in Kentucky and It is very humid here I did my makeup and headed out to run school arans I was nervous about stopping at the farmers market with the new makeup on and the fact that we are dealing with 87 humidity right now I gave it a go and went into the heat and did my shopping I came back to the truck and looked into the mirror to find that not only was the makeup still perfect it has a nice dewey glow to it which made my face look even more natural I went ahead and ordered a shade down to add to my collection so I can use it during winter when my tan is gone,0.102,0.025,0.873,0.9117,Positive

Just received this today and was immediately disappointed by the shade I wear shade 110 in the Maybelline Fit Me matteporeless foundation Ive worn it for years and Ive never had an issue I also have shade 120 dewysmooth and 330 in the same line I use the 120 as a summer shade or bronzer in the winter time and the 330 as a contour I find that contouring and bronzing with foundation lasts longer blends better and gives a more natural lookThe pictures are lineups of all of the foundations and the one Im reviewing is moved forward so you can tell the difference Please excuse the background my vanity is an antique secretary desk so its not exactly photogenic lol The one I purchased in this order is shade 110 in the DewySmooth and its darker than the shade 120 from the same line How is that possible Very disappointed Im guessing its a knockoff but if it isnt its extremely annoying that Maybelline would mislabel the foundation like this 110 is almost exactly my skin tone and 120 is what I use if I have a tanSecond pic is the lids again the one Im reviewing is moved forwardThe third pic is all of them a watched on my skin and blended at the bottom to see coverage and true color I stuck my arm next to an open window so you can get natural light and see it more clearly The order from elbow to hand is 110 this one 110 matteporeless 120 330 I have a bit of a tan on my arm now from driving so Im getting into my summer shade on my arm face is lighter but you can pretty clearly see that this 110 is WAY darker than the actual 110 matteporeless and a bit darker than 120 dewysmooth Its also more of an orangey shade than the 120 is DEFINITELY NOT PORCELAIN Again the 330 is a contour shade so chill lolThe fourth pic is the same as the 3rd just at my vanity so you can see it under different lightingThe fifth pic is the backs of each You can clearly see the difference in labeling I will say the shade 120 that I have has different labeling from all of them so Im guessing that is a change by Maybelline and Im very willing to accept that 120 is a possible knock off I also ordered on Amazon but either way shade 110 in matteporeless and dewysmooth should not be this differentVery disappointing For less than 4 Im not going to return it but Im bummed because Im out of my foundation and now Im stuck with a shade I cant use for a long time The consistency feels the same and the bottles are constructed the same Three stars solely because its still not a bad product,0.114,0.043,0.843,0.9901,Positive
Amazon often has fit me a lot cheaper like70than the stores so I can get several colors which is nice because I dont like my face all one color fit me is a buildable foundation  can look really natural It does tend to slide off I assume if you set it was powder it would hold better although I do use settings spray still seems to slide off abit But cant beat its natural but nice coverage and maybe my primer just doesnt work well with it,0.194,0.041,0.765,0.9044,Positive

I reintroduced myself to this company just recently after not using any Maybelline products for easily over 20 years I am in my 40s I bought it because I saw a MUA try it online and they raved about it I couldnt agree more I love a full face of make up because I have sun spotsmelasma however I dont want it to feel cakey to the touch or even when you put it on This foundation is super buildable which is great goes on easily and doesnt oxidize I have used high end foundations and this one is wayyy up there on the list of my favorites Dont let high end companies fool you into thinking makeup has to be expensive in order to be good Its all about good products and techniquesapplication The pic in the jean jacket is from my birthday I wouldnt  wear the foundation on my special day if I didnt think it was great Other pic and vid are from shortly before and you can see it looks flawless on skin  Full face of makeup but not caked on I promise you wont be disappointed I hope this helps,0.136,0.062,0.802,0.9189,Positive

I mean its good for the price  it came a little smaller than I thought but that was my fault I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING FOR A LIGHTER COLOR I got the porcelain 110It doesnt have any type of dispenser so it might be a little hard to take the foundation out of the bottle without making any messIt does the job its not full coverage in case you want to knowIts light weight and you cant really feel it once you put it onIt doesnt make your skin dry or oilyIt does cover redness you can still see your freckles which is what I wanted but I know some people wont like that,0.069,0.065,0.866,0.0961,Positive

I love this one I have normal to sometimes a bit dry skin and this one has the perfect coverage for me without looking like a cake I just need a little bit of it because my skin is pretty clean It leaves my skin dewy which I like and is easy to apply Unfortunately these doesnt come with a pump I really dont like that In Europe those foundation comes with a pump in each bottle so you dont have to worry about getting too much out of the bottle Thats why only 4 starsI picked ivory shade but found out its a tiny bit darker then the fit me matte and poreless foundation which is a bit annoying but next time I try the lighter shade or mix it a little bit,0.119,0.075,0.806,0.7085,Positive

I got shade102 This is everything for a nice no makeup makeup look or a natural beat Im not super into glamming it up with high coverage thick makeup beat to the gods so this is great for me I dont really wear make up all the time but when I do I like a nice medium coverage I do have acne scarring and hyperpigmentation as well as very fair neutral skin Like Im truly Casper the friendly ghost in the winter and neutral af so unless its truly neutral it will look either to pink or to orange aka crazy foundation mask that side note being said it runs a touch pink but I warmed it up with bronzer and it was fine Id say this is light coverage that is buildable to medium I have dry sensitive skin as well so you can imagine the struggle to find something that works We have a winner here this stuff didnt break me out Hallelujah I will say I love a natural finish but I do have texture and it shows however thats not the foundations fault I have texture no matter what primer or foundation I use especially because I like a dewy more natural finish Get it foundation even if ur on the fence it was like 4 bucks so you cant go wrong even if you dont like it,0.296,0.056,0.648,0.9967,Positive

I am SHOOKI have been looking for my perfect color match since 2018  I used to use Lancome Teint Idol in 555 not 555 Suede C which is the replacement of the former the shade 555 has been discontinued unfortunately and since they switched everything up I have just been throwing dollars at makeup to find or make my perfect shade Between adding pigments buying and mixing foundations and taking online quizzes like the one for Il Makiage and those found on Findationcom I was just lostI needed to reup on foundation since all the ones I bought last year before the pandemic were starting to get a lil crusty to say the least This was on sale and I figured why not I literally have nothing to lose except like five bucksI received it in the mail today and looked at it and was disappointedThis gon make me look ashy as hell I thoughtBUT BOY WAS I WRONGI put it on my face and nearly screamedListen  to all my chocolate humans out there this this might be the one yo lolALSO CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE SKIN FEEL LIKE okay sorry screaming  BUT ALSO LOLLike we all love a little matte moment especially when the pores are opening up like theyre fulfilling their lives dream of being moon craters but also when the skin is acting right and we just want a dewy moiskerized even tone to match our silky smooth base THIS IS THE ONE PERIODFor those wondering about undertone and stuff like that I would say that I have a rather warm or neutral tone Yellows oranges and golds are my colors but Ive been told that I have cooler rosy undertones I also love greens and blues but they just dont flatter me in the same way Whichever I am this foundation feels like its undertones are spot on for my skinAll in all 1010 Id say if you feel like you have a similar tone to me this foundation may work in your favorHave a blessed day poo,0.138,0.025,0.837,0.991,Positive

This is the best foundation I have used in a long long time I have a very big issue with foundations being extremely drying on my face I guess I have dry skin especially now in the winter I get small dry patches that are honestly not even noticeable until I put foundation on depending on the foundation This foundation applies so easily and smoothly and does not cling to any dry skin on my face The coverage is buildable maybe not to full coverage but definitely buildable to medium I have spent around 60 dollars for bareminerals pro foundations got two of em and they looked horrifying on me Made my skin super dry and flaky and looked cakey I cant believe a 4 dollar foundation beat the expensive ones by a lotttt This is the best foundation if you want to look flawless dewy and moisturized Obviously would look better on normal to dry skin Get this you wont regret it Dont forget your primer and setting powder makes all the difference,0.19,0.027,0.784,0.9835,Positive

I strongly recommend finding your color match in a drugstore and then buying a few extras online if you really love it I bought one of these for an event thought I had the correct color and I ended up having to wipe my makeup off and start from scratch because of how pale I looked A little definitely goes a long way Id even mix a few drops into your moisturizer to make a tinted moisturizer Unless you really know your shade dont buy this online,0.138,0.0,0.862,0.8885,Positive

Coming from someone with acne prone oily skin I was a grease pit in a few hours To save from having a savage breakout I washed it off after 3 hours In the winter this might be okay May have to try it again then Great price point As for the shade range it went from too pasty white to too orange I mixed two 105 and 102 together matched somewhat closer to my skin tone not really though It has buildable coverage and it did settle into fine lines a bit I didnt want to push it too far an cake it on because I was not sure how my oily skin would like it Apparently not so much I tested it on my arm first it was very smooth and blurred a bit So for those of you with drier skin this will be perfect,0.115,0.041,0.843,0.9004,Positive

This makeup is nice and buildable if you apply a little bit its just enough to cover up darker blemishes and make your skin tone look even It is so moisturizing without feeling oily never feel like my face is getting dry throughout the day when I apply it over my lotion Some other brands kind of seem to suck up the moisture from my lotion and eventually look cakey or cracky What Ive noticed about this the most is that it has one of the smoothest looks of any makeup Ive tried It never looks overdone or like a mask it literally never settles in creases and is so spreadable I still cannot find my exact skin tone so I apply a little bit of orangey ccostume makeup  with it which is hilarious but it works great together  I think the vitamin e in this product really helps me before I was using my current moisturizer I was using a much oilier moisturizer and I would always mix in  vitamin e because its great for healing scars and its good for my skin personally even though it breaks out some other peoples I have not noticed this at all breaking me out even nights when I leave it on from tiredness It has almost no noticeable fragrance at all which is great And it is so cheap on Amazon which is awesome,0.166,0.04,0.794,0.9899,Positive

I originally bought this foundation for a night out because I dont wear foundation normally Pretty much every day I just have concealer under my eyes and on some blemishes set with powder and Im ready for the dayNow I did get it maybe a shade or so too dark but I had enough time to order another shade to mix and got my perfect shadeFirst off this foundation is about a medium coverage I dont have problem skin but I have the usual redness and a few acne scars here and there My only problem are severe dark circles that are unfortunately genetic and I dont expect any foundation to begin to cover up hence the concealer that I mentioned earlier This foundation builds up nicely though I really only did a base layer and a thin second layer around my nose and forehead because of acne scarring and redness In no way is this cakey or thick and uncomfortable unless of course you pile a ridiculous amount on your skin which would make any foundation look pretty badThe consistency of this foundation is kind of liquidy but not super runny and hard to work with I apply pretty much all foundation makeup with either a damp beauty sponge or a buffing kabuki brush like the Real Techniques Expert Face or Buffing brushes I tried both and found that they both work equally well but I tend to favor brushes so I applied it with a flat top kabuki making sure to buff and blend but not too much as to blend the foundation right awayNow I found that even though I have combination skin oily in tzone pretty dry around brows and cheeks I only had to touch up once throughout the night Three hours of pretty much continuous dancing and I barely saw any oil forming Now I did set this with a powder beforehand but I could have probably gone without This foundation didnt wear off or separate throughout the whole night and the finish was great Good job MaybellinePROSGreat priceAmazing finishGood lasting powerNice consistency and feel almost like nothing is on your faceFANTASTIC color selection even better instoreCONSI got the wrong color at first but thats really my fault because I didnt see the color in personIf you have very oily skin you may want to see if you will like this but I know some of my friends who use this with oily skin and love it but its personal preference really,0.185,0.064,0.751,0.9958,Positive

I used to wear foundation in the 90s when the stuff was so thick you needed a paint roller to apply  I guess sometime in the early 2000s I stopped wearing liquid foundation and switched mineral powder though I wasnt completely thrilled with it  I then moved on to tinting my facial moisturizer with my mineral powder  A few years ago I discovered Burts Bees BB Cream which for the most part I was ok with  Then just a few weeks ago I saw FitMe on sale and I thought Why not So as Im applying it  I thought  Ugh I cant believe Im putting this stuff OMG this is soooooooooo easy I love this stuff  So now Im like Why didnt anyone tell me about this  Jealous people dont want anyone else looking good I dont know This is great I can only hope they wont change the formula,0.143,0.078,0.779,0.9039,Positive
I have been looking forever for a truly dewy foundation and I cant believe this is it I have spent up to 50 on others with disappointing results My skin is always dry no matter how much I moisturize and matte foundations only highlight my fine lines This is super light dewy and leaves my skin looking radiant while hiding my fine lines,0.234,0.105,0.661,0.8126,Positive

I have this foundation in both the matte  poreless and the dewey  fresh and I have them in the same shade number  which I understand is supposed to be universal across the Fit Me line However this one is a bit darkerwarmer than the same number which is 110 by the way than the Matte  Poreless version I think the coverage is excellent and it has a great textureconsistency It also wells pretty darn well and is easy to blend and layer if you need fuller coverage My only complaint is the tone The 110 in the MP is a nearperfect match for my skin but as my skin tends to skew dry it really only works for me in the summer when I generally need a slightly darker shade go figure I wish the tones were reversed because that would be perfect But if you are looking for an affordable foundation that has great coverage and is easy to work with I absolutely recommend the Fit Me line,0.231,0.009,0.761,0.9892,Positive

This foundation is one of the best Ive found Unlike the Clinique foundation I used to use this doesnt dry out my face or show the dry spots on my cheeks I use lots of moisturizer and cleanser as it is so the fact that the Clinique still showed dry spots was disappointing since that cost me over 20 But this stuff is cheaper and it could be used for more full coverage but I like using it as light coverage to just even out my skin It works pretty well with my sunscreen too And it stays on all day unless I accidentally wipe it off with my napkin at the restaurant oops but I use setting spray with it so that definitely helps it stay on Plus it is more sheer so it matches my skin tone pretty well while also giving me a slight tint to look more tan D,0.179,0.03,0.79,0.9786,Positive

Moisture  Very nice not too much  Nice finish  Spreads very easily no waste Not too sheer not cakey and doesnt look like im made up  Fragrance is overpowering  This wont work for my sensitive skin  Had to wash it off and by that time my eyes were glassy and running  Sorry  This is good foundation otherwise  You just might want to pass on it if you have rosacea or any skin sensitivity  Too bad  Didnt know how to rate it  If I didnt have the sensitive skin issue I would rate it at 5 but with skin issues I would give it a 3 just to make people aware of the fragrance issue   it seemed overpowering to me,0.059,0.087,0.854,-0.3397,Negative

I am so impressed with this foundation  I just tried it on and while I was blending I realized that I hadnt used my moisturizer first  I dont think Ive ever put on foundation without a moisturizer but I was curious and went ahead  It is a GREAT foundation My skin feels totally comfortable and very slightly dewy I am 59 years old my skin is dry and I have some fine lines So I think this is amazing There are no dry patches and the fine lines dont show at all Without a moisturizer Its a very clean look and feels light and fresh  I have been looking for a foundation that is similar to Clinique Extra Help Makeup for years since they discontinued it  Back then in my 20s my skin was pretty perfect and still somehow that makeup made it look and feel better This is the closest thing I have found to it The Clinique color was PorcelainI bought the Fair Ivory and it matches my pale skin with pink undertones  Update with moisturizer underneath its even better slightly more dewy with not the slightest greasy sensation,0.261,0.013,0.726,0.9954,Positive

Its taken a lot of trial and error recently to find a foundation  So many of them feel like youre wearing a waxy mask  The last one by Loreal was nearly impossible to wash off  I wanted something full coverage that felt light and smooth  Fit Me works beautifully  It goes on smoothly with a makeup brush I tapped it in with a Beauty Blender  It blurred and blended well in concert with the matching concealer  It moisturizes nicely without making your skin feel sticky  No creasing or running throughout the day even in the humidity I didnt feel like I was wearing a shield on my skin which was the first plus  The best part came in taking it off  It washed off easily with mild face wash and water  No residue in my pores no breakouts in the morning  I think I found a keeper,0.17,0.059,0.771,0.9538,Positive

I have very pale aging acne prone and dry skin I use curology to combat these problems But I have found foundations to be a factor in my skin problems I WAS using Maybelline Fit Me Matte  Poreless and I found it to be very drying and patchy on my skin Seemed to cause excessive acne as well But THIS foundation is so moisturizing for my skin It does not go on patchy AT ALL It goes on as a light coverage for me but I just apply another layer for more pigment It looks so natural and easy on my skin Get this if you have similar problems Color seemed too orange when I saw it at first but it went on PERFECTLY like it was made for my skin tone And that is a very hard thing for me to find usually since Im so pale,0.15,0.077,0.773,0.9429,Positive

Ive been using this foundation for 7 years now and have just this week purchased an airbrush makeup system for myself  I didnt want to spend a fortune on buying the foundation thats meant for an airbrush makeup machine so I used this Maybelline fit me foundation and mixed it with Mehron makeup mixing liquid to thin the foundation out like it needs to be for an airbrush I only used maybe a tbsp of this foundation a tablespoon or two of Mehron and a half a tsp of elf makeup setting spray I purchased some 2oz squeeze bottles and metal beads to mix my diy airbrush foundation and it works so amazingly Its perfect because this Maybelline is water based and exact what I needed Im glad I can keep using my favorite foundation and dont have to start shade hunting all over againThis foundation alone was never very good at staying in place Which was my only complaint but mixing it and adding setting spray into the blend made it perfect All day wear and no fading smudging or moving,0.087,0.048,0.865,0.8466,Positive
Not sure if its my luck with products but mine seemed to apply more on the watery side like spread oil on water paint  I seen the color difference laughs to self clearly not my shade but perfect for blending  I tried working it with another product in hopes to thinking it up more  Even different brushes  To me I think this product my skin just wasnt a match  It could be for you to find out an test for yourself in my opinionjust never know until you give it a whirl  but totally wish I had a video to show it applied ,0.224,0.013,0.763,0.9785,Positive

Ive found that there are two different colors in the FIT Me collection that work for me There is both  a warm and cool shade that when used together is exactly what I need I made the mistake of getting a FIT ME shade that was much too light for me Porcelain and so I ordered Nude Beige Ill admit I was devastated when I saw how orangey the Nude Beige was but when I applied it I couldnt believe how well it blended with my skin I use the Porcelain on the parts of my face that I want highlighted and then the warm Nude Beige everywhere else It actually works out well and it gives my skin a warm glow Take into account how cool or warm your natural skin tone is before finding your perfect shade or shades Also it is of VITAL importance to consider your skin type Is your skin dry Buy the dewy foundation Is your skin naturally oily Consider the matte I made the mistake of ordering matte the first time and it is DRY If you have issues with dry skin do yourself a favor and get the Dewey  Smooth foundation,0.181,0.063,0.756,0.9737,Positive

Maybelline Fit Me Dewy  Smooth Honestly this is the best drugstore foundation Ive ever tried I usually like a matte foundation but lately have found that my skin has been covering both ends of the combination spectrum and the foundation on my more dry cheek and forehead areas looked patchyflakey I love how smoothly this applies and it covers well without looking too thick The areas I need to keep matte  I apply setting powder to The areas that tend to patch up or look flakey I just left alone This combination has made my foundation look absolutely flawless Its well worth the small amount of money vs more expensive high end foundation Without a setting spray this will likely transfer off throughout the day but I found that a good setting spray will do the trick for that I use NYXs spray it works wellThe only issue I have with this is that I was a classic ivory in another one of Maybellines brand of foundation but this was significantly darker than the other classic ivory If you can go somewhere to swatch thatd be idealOverall for the price paid an extremely good value,0.18,0.018,0.802,0.9871,Positive

This is my favorite foundation ever You get such a great quality product at an amazing price I normally wear foundation 34 times each week and this bottle ends up lasting me at lease 4 months I would say the coverage is light to medium so if you are just looking to even out your skin tone or cover up a few small spots then this is the foundation for you I have pretty pale skin and I have had a hard time finding a good foundation that didnt leave me looking orange and I finally found this one It works really well with my skin tone and the color stays true and doesnt oxidize and get orangey like a lot of other foundations do I have pretty dry skin and have found that this works best if you exfoliate a few times a week and moisturize first about 30 minutes before applying the foundation so it doesnt have any dry patches to stick to I think that for the price this is an amazing foundation It applies smooth and the coverage lasts all day for me without having to reapply I do recommend using a setting powder over top of the foundation if you like it a bit more matte because this foundation can tend to look a bit shiny if not,0.188,0.006,0.806,0.9909,Positive

I am 50 years old and my skin can tend to be dry  I have a few wrinkles as would be expected and was really tired of foundation settling into the lines on my face and helping me look worse Also i found that since my skin has aged foundation just seemed to be sitting on top of my skin and didnt have a blended appearance  My daughter suggested that i try Dewy foundation for aging skin  Wow that really made a difference  It had not occurred to me that i needed something different since my skin had started to really show the signs of aging  I used MAC with mineral foundation for years and loved it but it didnt look the same recently  This foundation is exactly what it claims  Its dewy and my skin seems to feel softer immediately  the color blends flawlessly and I could not be happier  I used it the first day with a primer and it was great  I used it the second day without a primer and couldnt see any difference  I consider that a bonus  if your skin is aging and your younger foundation isnt quite the same i would definitely give this a try,0.117,0.038,0.845,0.945,Positive

I have been using a sealer and powder powder on my face for about 12 years because I never liked how liquid foundations didnt blend easy or would look really really thick and this has my mind blown I used a makeup brush and this it took me maybe 3 minutes to do and it covers so nice and leaves a nice Dewy look and lasts all day No more powdered or concealers needed Im so glad I finally bought it to try it out,0.125,0.078,0.797,0.732,Positive

This foundation was really beautiful on my skin It provides medium coverage and didnt settle in my 54 year old lines The finish was very skin like Initially I was very happy even though I wasnt thrilled the formula having parabens in it I could have overlooked that My skin is normal skewing towards sensitive After wearing this for two days my face started erupting in red mounds Only one ever filled with a liquify white head Its now been three days since discontinuing wear and Im still experiencing the occasional mound Im not someone who suffers breakouts nothing had changed but this foundation Even though I loved the look of this foundation I cannot recommend I also realize mine is not the only review stating this issue,0.106,0.041,0.853,0.8655,Positive

Not a bad foundation for the price I have dry skin and this stuff really helped stopped that cakey look many foundations give me It Is Dewey If youre not wanting that glow then use their Matte versionI am ungodly pale and the 110 matches my skin nicely I would suggest trying out different primers before applying this foundation I prefer silicone based primers but they didnt look right under this foundation So when I use this stuff I opt for Ultas hydro prime Much better pairingCoverage This foundations beings a good medium coverage that could easily be built up to full with a second go around with a beauty blenderCons after an hour or so the foundation starts to make my pores more noticeable But a quick blot with some oil absorbing sheets and the problem is fixed Not a bad trade off for a high performing yet inexpensive product,0.149,0.032,0.819,0.9613,Positive
I only gave it four star because its not the best match for me I wanted this dewy because I have dry skin versus the matte poreless coconut But turns out I like the other one better as far as matching This one gives a lot of yellow undertone so does the mate poreless but a lot less I just use the poreless coconut and make sure to moisturize well I also use a shimmer prime for the dewy look,0.157,0.027,0.816,0.8889,Positive
Im biracial black and white and this is the closest commercial product I can find to my skin tone I was excited to see it in the store for the first time because it has a yellowishgreenish tint instead of a pinkish tint My issue with brown makeup is most companies make it very pink so it doesnt match my natural colorI only apply once in the morning but I also use a matte finishing spray so that likely helps I got a compliment on how good this makeup looks from one of my African American colleagues who said she also has trouble finding foundation that matches her skin because its usually too pink I told her to try this Cosmetic companiespay attention Ditch the heavy pinktinted foundationsGlad to have found this on Amazon because its less expensive to buy here than the store,0.105,0.034,0.861,0.887,Positive

I purchased the Maybelline Fit Me Dewy  Smooth Foundation in shade Mocha 360  It arrived earlier than the delivered by date and was in great condition  No spillage cracks or broken seals  Yes the dewy foundation is runnier in terms of consistency than the matte version but thats just how Maybelline made the formula  So do use a light hand when pouring this product outAlso you the dewy foundation will have to be built up depending on what type of coverage you like  In my opinion this product had a strong reddishorange undertone when it was first applied  However as it dried and set the undertone wasnt as strong  I put on one coat and didnt need to reapply at all  I would recommend the dewy formula other people with dry skin because it did help to keep my skin feeling hydrated unlike when I use matte foundationsWill definitely be purchasing this product again,0.2,0.021,0.779,0.9849,Positive

So I am a foundation lover I often purchase and try new ones searching for the perfect one This one isnt bad It perfect for a light coverage foundation It evens skin tone but still allows imperfections to show through making it look natural It is one of the more dewy foundations I have tried but as someone with extremely dry skin its defiantly not as dewy as Id hoped It does cling to any of my dry spots but it has a more satin finish It will move so I have to set it with powder It reminds me of LOréal fresh wear,0.172,0.0,0.828,0.9498,Positive

I got shade 110 which is Porcelain so should be super light right It goes on an orangey tan color And its not like I can order a lighter shade I also thought this was supposed to be a full coverage product but its super sheer It doesnt apply smoothly to my face either I honestly though this would be the solution to my foundation woes but its not going on my dry skin any better than all the other foundations Ive tried And dewy More like greasy And smooth It probably goes on most peoples skin smooth but on mine it just breaks apart and looks like peely skin Also maybe I got a bad bottle but it feels a little grittyewww I tried to take a pic for you but my phone wouldnt focus closely enough to show you what Im talking about,0.121,0.098,0.782,0.6851,Positive
I love Maybelline fit me foundations and Ive always used 102 in the matte variety even though I have dry skin because Ive never been able to find fair porcelain in the dry skin kind I was so excited to see this especially because it has spf in it It came in one day and the shade is perfect however the bottle was missing a chunk of glass which fell out of the bubble wrap it was in and nearly cut me So that was definitely disappointing But I would probably buy again just because this is the exact shade in the exact formula Ive been looking for,0.128,0.047,0.826,0.798,Positive

this is a really great product  i got a small sample and tried it out  it went on very smoothly and had a very natural finish  its is also very light in texture and therefore not noticeable once on the skin  it doesnt mask your actual skin and it does give nice enough coverage as long as you dont have a need for a fullon maski think this product comes in 2 types  because the sample i got was for a particular shade and that shade really fit me well i got the same type and shade when i made a purchase  the dewy smooth is nice enough but those w combination skin should be aware that it does leave a truly dewy finish ie a bit of shine  if you like a really natural unfinished look this is greati have tried many brand names that cost 810 times the price i paid on amazon and this product would stand up favorably against all of them,0.169,0.008,0.823,0.9748,Positive

the fit me collection is probably one of if not THE best foundation you can buy from a drug store brand I have kind of temperamental skin it will be super oily one day and then super dry the next so on my dry days my face tends to be pretty dry even after my thorough moisturizing routing  so when using the matte  poreless foundation it would just enhance pores and textures I am a man too so I had even more texture than my lady counterparts and I just thought that was just how makeup was gonna look on me for the dry days and then I found out how revitalizing dewy foundation is and I am ecstatic long lasting moisturizing and just a steal of less than 10 get it,0.121,0.047,0.832,0.8815,Positive
Im 43 Used with a blurring primer first and next time wore with a moisturizer Both times it didnt look dewey It felt dry on my face looked chalky in some areas and I felt like it clearly showed my pores My skin is very dry and aging I thought this would be a good foundation but its just not for my skin type  Maybe it will compliment those with a dewey skin type anyway but I have a lot of pores on my face and this just amplified them Im not out much money and when I was a little younger this brand was great but even with a primer or moisturizer it didnt look good Next time I may use the tarte Amazonian clay powder to set it as it usually can soften the skin a bit and I also blame myself too thinking I can take dry skin with tons of pores and make it look Dewey somehow Those miracles dont happen lol,0.114,0.036,0.85,0.9202,Positive

So glad to find the lightest shade  fair porcelain  here on Amazon  Its about a shade darker than fair porcelain in the matte and poreless version but still light enough for my super fair complection I have normal to dry skin and the dewy and smooth worked wonderful  It gave my skin a nice dewy look but not greasy  I will say if you have oily skin this might not work as well  Im 46 and this didnt accentuate my fine lines  Id say it has a medium coverage  I applied this with my fingers  or a beauty blender and both methods worked fine  Its a thin liquidity foundation and doesnt feel heavy on the skin This is one of the best foundations Ive ever tried   I paid 599  If you have pale maturing normal to dry skin then you might really like this Hope this review helps,0.267,0.034,0.699,0.9923,Positive

This foundation has a very pretty finish but I cant find a perfect shade for my lightmedium olive skintone I bought this one for my summer shade and its very peachy kind of orange I would not recommend this finish for anybody who has scarring or blemishes It was light to medium coverage at best for me and it didnt build well with brushes or sponges However it has a very natural look and doesnt smell bad or feel heavy on the skin,0.164,0.094,0.742,0.8238,Positive
My new favorite foundation I have been using a foundation that caused the skin on my nose to peel and crack while at the same time rubbing off within just a few hours revealing the redness of my nose Basically it was disgusting Before trying this foundation I thought the cracking of my skin was just because it is extremely dry but when I put this foundation on i realized that it stayed put on my nose all day and I no longer have a peeling nose When you put this foundation on it feels like there is nothing on your face and it is very buildable The only problem I have with this foundation is that my eyeliner wears off way quicker and smudges on my undereye but that can be fixed with a little powder which I dont do because of my dry skin Love it,0.073,0.057,0.87,0.5423,Positive

I am on my 3rd bottle of this and absolutely love it This seller sent the product as described with no issues I intially tried this foundation as an alternative to the maybelline fit matte poreminimizing foundation There is definitely a color difference between the two with the matte one being lighter than this one is I was hesitant to try this product because I have combination skin and I did not want oil to become prominant in all of the wrong places Although this foundation says dewy I find that it goes on smooth and resembles a more natural look with good coverage I still need concealer but minimal The sunscreen is definitely a plus For me I have a 8 hour day at school and the foundation holds strong without my face looking oily as long as I use powder on top of it,0.139,0.043,0.818,0.9341,Positive

So awesome in general but especially at this cheap price point I wasnt even expecting much I just looked up a few reviews and threw this in my cart to get to 35 Most foundation brands low and high end dont carry shades light enough for me That was my first pleasant surprise that the shade was actually a good match It has pretty good medium coverage and a really nice finish and doesnt do what so many more expensive foundations have done which is create dry patches on my skin The only minor flaw is that even on my dry skin after a few hours the glowy finish can start looking a bit oily which is why I dont think this would be a good foundation for oily skin types I have skin thats a bit acne prone too and after using this for two months I can confidently say it hasnt caused any breakouts either,0.211,0.018,0.772,0.9878,Positive

Im usually into highend foundations  Becca Mac Tarte and Id recently bought one that was a shade too dark so I thought instead of dropping another 40 on a second foundation to lighten it out why not buy a drugstore brand Ive heard good things about this foundation and its considered a dupe for Macs studio fix liquid foundation so I went ahead and purchased off here WHERE HAS THIS BEEN LL MY LIFE I have the worst case of oily skin and have tried baking mattifying primers setting sprays YOU NAME IT I decided to try it alone and my foundation has never looked so fresh and smooth for so long I work about 89 hours a day and this has lasted me the entire day without me looking like I just did the most intense HIIT workout And for the price buying this would be a nobrainer,0.051,0.072,0.877,-0.4983,Negative

So the positives first the color matches my skin wonderfully and it is very moisturizing Now the negatives it leaves your skin feeling sticky like you can feel the make up on your skin all day And the smell way too perfume for me Product is a little too sheer More like a tinted moisturizer All in all for the price I will keep it and when my skin is super dry probably use it,0.214,0.0,0.786,0.9515,Positive

In general Im a fan of the Fit Me line there are 2 formulas a ton of colors to choose from the price is reasonable and I can buy it at the grocery store I have drycombination skin so I picked this up as an alternative to the matte formula which can sometimes accentuate my dry patches Unfortunately I still far prefer the matte formula to this I found this difficult to blend even with a beauty blender I bought the same shade as I would in the matte but upon application it oxidized to a weird orangey tone in some places of my face It didnt settle into my skin throughout the day and lookedfelt like it was just sitting on top of my face I wasnt happy with the coverage either and didnt find this to be very buildable and gets cakey looking if you add more I havent thrown this away yet and occassionally come back to it hoping for better results every time I give it another chance but end up disliking it every time I wear it,0.114,0.068,0.818,0.8255,Positive
Ive been having trouble finding a foundation that will work with how dry my skin is so I decided to give this one a shot First of all this foundation smells really good The scent isnt very strong though you wont smell it while wearing it Im pretty pale and have pink undertones so I ordered shade 115 per the recommendations of the shade guide on Maybellines website and its perfect I used my Fenty Beauty sponge to apply and it went only evenly wasnt cakey and made my skin look dewy but not too much It also hid the dry patches I have and didnt flakeHowever this foundation is a bit runny and you have to pour it out so be carefulBut as of right now I would definitely purchase this again,0.093,0.04,0.867,0.7956,Positive

This foundation gives very good coverage and goes on feeling very smooth It was darker than I hoped thats more Maybellines fault for not making lighter shades of this foundation for pink skin tones but it thankfully doesnt oxidize I like that its not matte and I dont necessarily need to put on highlighter to look like a normal face It does get a little cakey and move around even with powder Its especially bad under the nosepads of glasses However it was pretty good at controlling oily parts of my face even though this is targeted towards dry skin,0.152,0.109,0.739,0.603,Positive

I bought the 225 medium buff and Im surprised what a wonderful color match it is It gives a beautiful finish very buildable and lightweight What I love about this is that since the color matches me so perfectly I dont have to wear it all over my face I use it only where I need itOne little regret I have is that I shouldve gone for the Matte  Poreless line The one I have is Dewey and Smoothcuz I have dry skin I cannot complain it looks beautiful but at a closer look it does settle into my pores I might have to use a primer Im taking one star away for settling in my pores,0.143,0.016,0.841,0.9059,Positive

I would have given this 2 12 stars I dont dislike it but I dont think I have much use for it Some pros it is lightweight not cakey doesnt settle into fine lines but wore off after a couple hours I dont mind doing a concealer touch up but I dont like having to bring foundation with me to redo my foundation by lunchtime It is a good color for very fair skin and a good neutral  neither too yellow or too pink I would probably not buy again unless I found a good makeup setting spray that made it stay on longer then I would give this another try since I like the feel of itI will say though that if you only need makeup very briefly  like for just taking a photo or quickly going on an appointment you need to have some makeup on for an hour or two  this has nice coverage and is not an obvious looking makeup as some foundations For this purpose I think it is pretty useful,0.154,0.054,0.792,0.9661,Positive

I like this product because you can find a shade nearly exact to your skin tone no matter what it is Whether I am tan during the summer or pale in the winter months I can find a shade that works for me I usually use the matte version of this foundation but I wanted that dewey glow thats popular right now so I bought this one I will say that the color is spot on perfect but the actual consistency of the foundation is very light coverage It goes on well but I need to reapply it at least once during the day to keep the same coverage Blends super well though,0.187,0.013,0.8,0.9666,Positive
I got a sample of this in the mail and took a chance and tried it I was amazed at the coverage and figured it was just a fluke But I just had to order it and see if the full size was just as good When I saw how cheap this makeup was I almost didnt bother ordering it because how good could it really be for this price of around 5  all I can say is WOW I have medium skin tone with combination skin and my skin is picky so I guess it might be a little sensitive I only have to put a little of this and it covers my blemishes and feels really light For 5 everyone should try it I would suggest going to the store first though so you can see the color you should get You really cant tell online how a color is next to your skin,0.13,0.0,0.87,0.9625,Positive

It looks ok but I STILL have to mix it with moisturizer so that my skin doesnt dry out Hence the 1 star deduction Once applied however it definitely makes my skin look flawless I also use a pore reducing primer It lasts all day and it looks natural on me You can barely tell I have it onOverall I absolutely love it Despite needing moisturizer added in I love the results A little bit goes a LONG way,0.284,0.0,0.716,0.9805,Positive

I have really light skin and often find it really hard to get makeup that worksfits my skin This foundation provides pretty good coverage and is lightweight Also you dont need to use very much of it at all which is nice I use Dr Jart  BB cream then this foundation and I cover it with Bare Minerals  Matte powder and this combination works really nicely on my skin Like I said I am really pale so this is the closest thing Ive found to my skin tone it is not as white as Id like but it does the job I will probably buy another bottle when Im through with this one Maybelline products are generally always a good buy,0.125,0.011,0.864,0.9011,Positive
Im shocked at how great this foundation is for a little I paid I was in need of something with good coverage and stay power and this was perfect and what makes it even better is it doesnt break the bank If you havent tried Fit Me then I would highly suggest you do My skin type is normal to dry  especially dry in the winter so I purchased the dewy and Im in love My skin breathe and it doesnt leave my skin thick and sticky feeling either It blends out nicely has great coverage and lasts me all day long I will be buying this foundation again I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for good quality coverage and affordable foundation,0.232,0.031,0.737,0.9813,Positive

I am not crazy about liquid foundation but I am a fan of Maybellines concealers so I decided to give it a try  The color was perfect color for my fair skin Its a thinner foundation so its not heavy feeling on my face It blends very smoothly and evenly Considering I am not a fan of liquid I do like this one I normally wear the  Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse Foundation and I definitely still prefer it over the Fit me but if you like liquid foundations I would definitely recommend this,0.353,0.014,0.632,0.9886,Positive
I rarely wear foundation but I do I wear this It is darker than my skin but it blends evenly and I like the final look I dont like to apply this with my fingers and I refuse to use sponges or brushes so I no longer wear this Itd have to be a very special occasion for me to wear makeup nowadays For now I only wear bb cream and even thats not dailyYou will need a setting powder andor spray with this product I always felt particularly slick with it,0.113,0.071,0.816,0.5981,Positive

I really like this product but the thing is that it wasnt what I thought See I was searching through the Maybelline liquid foundations and there were two kinds of this FitMe Foundation There was the dewy kind and the matte kind I passed on the dewy because Im trying to avoid a wet looking face and chose this one assuming it was matte But I was wrong Its dewy So that kind of caught me off guard but actually when I tried it on it wasnt so bad Especially after I brushed on some of the FitMe Matte powder So it all turned out great The color was exactly as expected and matches my skin tone perfectly So it was a lovely surprise,0.266,0.046,0.688,0.9893,Positive
I love this foundation because of the price but it also works great for my dry skin The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it really needs to come with a pump component I dont use a lot of foundation at once so opening and closing the bottle numerous times allows for the product to oxidize and change colors over time I know a pump would up the cost a bit but it would be worth it Other than that its a good product,0.194,0.0,0.806,0.9555,Positive
Ive been using this type of foundation for years and been happy with it  The colour is a little different but Im not sure what is at fault  By this I mean that I use this and then put a Maybelline Fit powder on top  My powder is 120 and the liquid is 115 but when I put the powder on it lightens everything up  Either the liquid is darker or the powder is lighter,0.099,0.076,0.825,0.204,Positive

This is my favorite liquid foundation I had never used it until I purchased on here I was pleasantly surprised with how well it matched my skin color especially since I wasnt able to see it in person before buying I used the match me finder on Maybelline to find my color I like that this foundation has SPF in it to help protect my skin from the sun so I dont have to worry about applying any sunscreen before or after applying my foundation This foundation has offered me great coverage  it lasts all day even in the heat whenever sweating happens I will be purchasing more of this foundation for sure it is by far my favorite,0.229,0.0,0.771,0.9792,Positive

Moisturize before using Its amazing and for fair skin so if your pale this is it You can build up coverage cause the first layer is a sheer finish Throughout the day my face gets dewy but at first putting it on its almost like a powder foundation which i recommended as well The consistency is runny would work better with a pump but you cant beat that price,0.209,0.0,0.791,0.9268,Positive

Ive been using this foundation for a couple years now  I got it because it was recommended as a cheaper dupe for the Nars foundation  It comes very close to the Nars foundation and has the added benefit of a sunscreen  I buy Dewy because it helps hide my wrinkles better and add moisture to the dry areas on my face but Ive used the matt poreless and its really good as well  If you like liquid foundation and you find a close enough color match you will really like this product  It truly covers well and makes me look younger without feeling heavy or greasy,0.233,0.039,0.728,0.9727,Positive
It is so easy to apply and is very long lasting Will definitely buy again At first I thought this toffee 330 Dewy smooth would be too light for me but it was a great match I also use 335 classic tan on occasion I do not mix they both fit me really well individually,0.261,0.0,0.739,0.9452,Positive

I really like this product Yes when you first apply it it looks very greasy but it fades as it sinks into your skin and if you apply powder on it I have pretty dry skin so that is probably why do I wouldnt recommend this to anyone with oily skin But the colors dont go super fair and 115 Ivory looks pretty yellow and tan on me I probably just got the wrong shade though,0.137,0.15,0.713,-0.2802,Negative

Its oily first of all and too much of a watery texture that it covers very poorly it does even out the skin tone at the beginning but it fades very fast The worst thing of all is how the color gets so terrible throughout the day Im an Asian with normal Asian skin tone so I chose the shade nude beige since it matches my skin tone so well or at least it seemed to When it was first applied it seems to blend in very well it doesnt really cover anything though and with a feeling that all my pores are blocked and my skin cant breathe Anyways just about 3 or 4 hours later when I look in the mirror I see a red to brown face with patches of uneven color That is horrible Not only was it darker than my original skin tone but it also gets my face all that redness and unevenness as if I got a bad tan It might be the SPF ingredients that caused so but this is a foundation product people expect to get a stable coverage from it And then its oily too oily as for such low SPF It doesnt stay on well either when I try to blot the oil on my nose and forehead it would be taken off just like that leaving my nose red So then I have to apply some other foundation powder product This is a pretty inexpensive drugstore foundation after all but really its not worth it,0.092,0.102,0.806,-0.7042,Negative

I usually wear the matte 110 porcelain version of this However I ordered without knowing its the dewy version I feel the dewy version is very orange The matte has more of a yellow tone I find orange patches on my face when it oxidizes too Why does the matte one match my skin flawlessly and this one is considerably darker  If you are super pale like I am I would highly suggest the matte version But it does offer the same coverage I use a setting powder on it which makes it matte rather than dewy because my skin feels greasy with this foundation Thats more of a personal preference though I will likely use this more in the summer when I have a little bit of color in my skin,0.046,0.0,0.954,0.5574,Positive

I love this foundation This product is such a great buy for the price and if you know how to use makeup there is little difference between drug store and high end makeup For foundation especiallyBesides that this blends so perfectly and goes on smooth The only issue I have is the way the bottle is designed This makes it hard to get product onto a sponge and ultimately makes my makeup routine take a bit longer,0.165,0.017,0.819,0.9356,Positive

I have tried so many upscale foundation brands Armani Lorac MAC iT Clinique Clarins and though Armani was it for awhile I have never gotten compliments the way I have since I started wearing this foundation 2 weeks ago So many people including a cosmetologist told me how beautiful my skin looks how pretty and fresh I look and Im past 50 I use this all over with a bit of matteporeless on my T zone and my skin looks almost flawless,0.152,0.028,0.82,0.8793,Positive

Love this foundation  Perfect colour for my pale pale skin and no irritation on my overly sensitive skin  It is truly amazing that none of the other much more expensive foundations have worked as well  In fact so many of them irritated my eyes and looked so orange on my skin that I really didnt hold out much hope for this one  Sadly the ones that had worked so well in the past had been discontinued I hope this one stays around for a while but Im stocking up just in case it doesnt  Thanks for asking for my review,0.147,0.097,0.756,0.5486,Positive

This is the perfect product and goes great with my skin but as the day goes on it gets darker I only use it on the areas where Ill bronze over  because I love the finish but I need a different one for my T zone and highlighting areas Might look into getting a super light one for those areas and hope it doesnt get too dark by the end of my work day,0.232,0.043,0.724,0.9531,Positive

This is a great choice for dry skin Many foundations make my dry patches stand out which is an obvious giveaway that Im wearing foundation This made my skin feel hydrated It blends fairly easily and I was able to build up the parts of my face that needed fuller coverage The consistency is very liquidy The smell is faint but I would decribe it as smelling like sunscreen and baby powder Product loses one star because it contains butylparaben and ethylparaben,0.088,0.035,0.878,0.5499,Positive
Im a makeup artist I used this on a wellknown actress who was filming a movie locally Her look required a very natural appearance and this foundation was perfect,0.228,0.0,0.772,0.7574,Positive
This is another great Maybelline product and even though I purchased it online it was easy to guess which would be right for my skin color  If youve purchased from them before they tend to have the same color lines that cross over  I have used this product prior and knew what to expect  I like to wear this in the summer time because it is lightweight and doesnt feel so cakey with the coverage  It has a moderate amount of coverage and I think works well if you use a power finish to go over it,0.118,0.0,0.882,0.891,Positive
Pleasantly surprised that the lightest shade actually goes with my skin tone I am fair skinned with freckles and this is buildable coverage  with a foundation brush you can build the coverage to conceal freckles age spots etc The formula I received also minimizes pore appearance so it gives a smooth matte finish I actually forgot to put on setting powder the first time I used it because the appearance was so finished I like this foundation a lot because having acne scarring and freckles I want something that has buildable coverage but doesnt look fake This has a very smooth nice appearance to it and feels very silky going on,0.143,0.0,0.857,0.9125,Positive
This is a medium coverage foundation that works wonderfully  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily  I would say this foundation has an 8 hour wear before you need to add another application  The application can be messy because the foundation is generally very runny and if the bottle is knocked over it will instantly spill out  My advice for application would be to use a good foundation primer brush setting powder with a beauty blender and youll have a flawless application  In this picture Ive used the maybelline fit me concealer too,0.184,0.024,0.792,0.946,Positive
I love the matte poreless Fit Me foundation Its the best foundation Ive used It is probably the only one Ive ever used that I dont have to mix 2 colors together or have a funky foundation line I love that its inexpensive too The only other foundation that was this good was 25 and was discontinued I havent even been tempted in the last 2 years to try another foundation Word of caution when buying as an add on item you may get the dewy foundation instead of the matte So be careful when buying online,0.194,0.013,0.792,0.9636,Positive
So this foundation is comparable to the Smashbox hydrating foundation but at a much lower cost I do love the smashbox foundation but I cant spend 36 on it anymore This foundation is hydrating light weight and the coverage is pretty good It doesnt cling to all my dry patches like other foundations,0.265,0.043,0.692,0.9468,Positive

I wasnt a fan of this foundation  For the price I figured it was worth a shot and it was  The color worked well for me but instead of feeling dewy and smooth it just felt watered down and hard to get coverage  I have dry skin so that I like having moisturizing in my foundation but this one unfortunately was just not for me,0.126,0.093,0.781,0.3041,Positive

I really liked the coverage this product was able to give I gave it a 4 star only because Im afraid of all the chemicals used in this product I researched about it after buying the product On EWG reviews this product was a 610 10 being super dangerous I ended up buying a natural organic foundation recently It makes me happy But overall if you dont mind the chemicals this foundation is TRULEY the best drugstore foundation Ive ever used I chose the color simply by looking a reviews on YouTube and blogs and it a tad lighter but I can still use it,0.139,0.02,0.841,0.9071,Positive

I bought a different shade before but I tried this shade because it was cheaper and also I want to try if it matches my skin better Wow was I surprised It perfectly matched my sun tanned skin It looks like I dont have any foundation at all but the difference is my skin looks smoother and even toned But I guess months from now when my summer skin gets a few shade lighter then I have to buy a lighter shade of this foundation,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.9716,Positive

I found that this foundation oxidized a bit througout the day and also didnt have enough shades for me to find a perfect match but it was decent considering the price and 5 hour wear without needing powdering or touchups There is no funny scent to this formula and it comes in a pour bottle which doesnt get messy if tighly closed,0.137,0.043,0.82,0.724,Positive
I love this brand so decided to order this one from Amazon It came a little lighter than I expected which is a bummer but I guess it could be worn in the winter time since thats when folks usually get lighter I like that I dont constantly have to keep applying it and it lasts I would just recommend checking your color in the stores before purchasing it online,0.147,0.065,0.788,0.705,Positive

My daughter has very fair skin and its hard for us to find anything light enough for her in the local stores without buying department store makeup We found this one and she LOVES it It is actually light enough for her and has a great finish She loves how it goes on and the coverage she gets Once she sets it with powder she doesnt have to mess with it the rest of the day She is 16 but has dry skin She still uses a light moisturizer underneath this foundation,0.114,0.012,0.873,0.8302,Positive

Ive bought this brand and this shade many times porcelain so I know what it should look like The one I received was extremely darker than usual and no safety seal tape The label on the cap and the bottle matched so only other explanation is that its expired and oxidized Unless Maybelline let mispackaged foundation pass inspection and sent to Amazon It looks about 6 shades darker than porcelain So if you receive a much darker shade than expected its probably a mistake,0.082,0.054,0.864,0.34,Positive

This range seems so inconsistent with color I always buy the classic ivory which isnt actually as light as the shade leads you to think The matte and the dewy are different colors in the same shade I usually buy the dewy one in this color and this time I got it and I noticed the color is super dark almost like a medium tan colorI love this foundation and have been using it for years but they must have changed the formula in some way because the color doesnt match me anymore Mind you Ive literally used this shade and range for like 6 years,0.09,0.0,0.91,0.8158,Positive

I ordered shade 355 and I have to say that Im happy with the color and pigmentation It isnt terribly opaque so it is easy to build the color from sheer to medium coverage This foundation color is perfect for those with yellow undertonesWhen I first put it on it was QUITE oily which was surprising seeing as I have dry skin But as the foundation sets and oxidizes it becomes truly dewy and not as wet as it was when I first put it on I would definitely suggest wearing it with some loose powder on top because its easily transferable,0.205,0.026,0.768,0.952,Positive
I was expecting the liquid to match the stick foundation which I was running out of  The liquid 120 is a bit darker and not as creamy as the stick  In all other respects it is a good foundation not too heavy or cakey and covers well without looking like you are wearing much  Provided the color really does Fit You  I went to 110  instead and am more satisfied with the lighter color,0.168,0.027,0.805,0.8768,Positive
The dewy formula oxidizes much more than the matte formula I loved the matte one of this and the lightest shade perfectly matched my pale skin the dewy one is pretty but its more sheer and looks a little bit darker than the matte even though its the same shade Also wears off later in the day but I didnt set it,0.113,0.0,0.887,0.7311,Positive

I bought this in both the matte  dewy formulas The matte came in the normal correct extremely pale shade As someone who looks like theyve never seen the sun thats what I was going for Unfortunately I purchased two bottles of the dewy formula as well and though labeled 110  were both deep shades of orangetan Not sure how quality assurance missed this one,0.102,0.096,0.802,0.1124,Positive

I wont buy this again It goes on a little more sheer than I prefer it resembles more of a lightweight tinted moisturizer than a full coverage foundation  It applies really smooth and looks very dewy which I love but I guess I prefer a more full coverage foundation which I didnt even realize till I used this one  When I put it on it was darker than I expected but after going on vacation I got a little sun and its perfect now Im not worried about that but what i DO hate is although it looks like I have foundation on when I apply it and look in the mirror  EVERY SINGLE picture of me since wearing this  IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE NO MAKEUP ON Im not talking I look natural Im talking it looks like I just woke up and my face looks like crap  I hate being wasteful so Ive been making myself wear it but it seems like its going to last forever so I think I just need to pitch it and find something else  My usual foundation had been discontinued and I had high hopes for this one after seeing some review pics  Sadly this is NOT it for me,0.14,0.107,0.754,0.7505,Positive

i really wanted to like this because its the perfect color for my pale complexion but i just cant it has about a medium coverage at best so if you have anything other than an absolute perfect skin youll need to use lots of concealer thats just a minor flaw though the big thing is that it just looks terrible on the skin it made my pores look HUGE even with an expert brush and the right technique it looks grainy and chalky when youre done but is extremely oily to the touch and soaks up any kind of finishing powder it gets right up in every little line you have after about 2 minutes of wearing it and makes you look about 10 years older so the color is a big yes everything else is a big NO i tried everything imaginable to make it work and i wear make up on a daily basis but a bad product is a bad product and no technique in the world can fix that,0.118,0.105,0.777,0.3252,Positive

I usually buy this T my local drug store but price was great on amazon so I got it on here My favorite by far does not make me sensitive skin break up gives me a nice dewy look which I like I like matte but personally I think it looks awful on drier skin and thats what I have I love the dewy finish look at it last all day,0.323,0.047,0.63,0.9769,Positive

Disappointed  Expected more  Drying on my skin  What are us baby boomers to do now that we are older  Make up is catered to the young that have oily skin or combination skin  There is a market out there for foundation for older women who no longer have acne and our skin is dry and we want to cover up uneven skinn tones now  The make up market doesnt look at us as spending dollars  Please there are lots of older women begging for a sheer foundation that covers just enough and is moisturizing  And is luminizing  Reflects light  Sheer tints dont work either,0.034,0.05,0.917,-0.4019,Negative

Ibought this product after purchasing the maybelline fit me 355 n coconut which was way too light and yellow and immensely  mattifying I then bought the Maybelline dream velvet in 95 coconut which was also too dark and oxided horribly darker i bought this product in 360 mocha with hopes that maybe it would be a match but alas it is way too dark  and it also oxidizes I decided to mix the 355 and 360 together because evidently i am a shade in between however that also went horribly wrong as the 355 has a very yellow under tone and the 360 a red under tone do the result was comparable to the black opal hazel nut before it oxidizes  or the ridiculous new formula in the new Maybelline super matte line 356 war coconut obviously this was not for me as this brand does not make my shade i included a pictures below,0.063,0.133,0.804,-0.9287,Negative

Tried it because I heard many many good things  everyone claims its THE drug store foundation Im unfortunately accustomed to using high end foundations but wanted to give more affordable alternatives a try Color match was fine  Im East Asian and got it in Sandy Beige However I was shocked that it could only go on smoothly with a makeup sponge Also theres no pump  That mightve been fine but then I found that the foundation runs off my face halfway through the day leaving it an obvious patchy oily mess by the end of the day A foundation that requires touchup No thank you,0.085,0.119,0.796,-0.5994,Negative

I thought this might be the foundation I was happy with Not so Although it is easily applied it is very oily Oily is not even a good description its more like greasy I had to slather on oil absorbing powder after application of Fit just to dull the wet look Oh well the price is not too bad and I will keep searching for that perfect foundation,0.253,0.065,0.682,0.9317,Positive
Its a good foundation and doesnt have a pinkish tone to it The only problem I have about this foundation is that when I put it on I can always see the foundation streak or it looks dryish I think it might be bc Im using a brush to apply it and I might have to use a sponge but overall its alright bc it gives a really nice glowy appearance and covers most little scars and imperfections,0.115,0.025,0.86,0.7743,Positive

I usually use Matte and poreless I thought I would try the Dewy and smooth I received HALF OF A BOTTLE I am so angry that I got screwed over I have a pump that I put in my bottles that dont have pumps When I opened up the bottle to add the pump half the damned bottle was already gone I sure as hell didnt pay half price  I dont know if it was Maybelline or the seller but I wont be buying from either one again Ill stick to my NYX,0.032,0.148,0.82,-0.8813,Negative
The color is fine and it blended well but the oily feeling it gave me was not good at all  I felt like my face was greasy the whole time I wore it and couldnt wait to get it off  I am used to using bare minerals but have also tried the Mary Kay Timewise foundation and definitely liked the Mary Kay better  Maybe I should have gone for the Matte rather than dewy and smooth,0.221,0.036,0.743,0.9318,Positive

I really like to love this but it just not enough If you are looking for a full coverage then this is NOT for you I bought the MATTE one and that is way better than this DEWY type I keep on reapplying but it just wont cover that much Also the first time I spread it I felt blah and not amazed Then it took me hours before I experienced the DEWY effect on my face This is not just for me Ill stick with the Matte type,0.091,0.094,0.815,-0.0679,Negative

This foundation is one of my top 5 foundations that I like to use it has a nice consistency which smooths over and blends nicely with my skin leaving a lovely natural finish It has good coverage and does a pretty good job at concealing my pores and imperfections It doesnt leave my skin all oily by lunchtime like alot of other foundations do The only downside to this foundation I found is it doesnt last all day by early afternoon Im needing to apply more,0.293,0.02,0.687,0.9749,Positive

This foundation oxidised on me after about 23 hours and also came off a lot from my nose and chin To start with however the finish  coverage was good and it looked natural,0.153,0.0,0.847,0.6597,Positive
So Ive used this foundation on and off for a few years now While I do appreciate the price I wouldnt say its really poreless I noticed around my nose it actually exaggerated my pores a lot and the matte effect was quite drying so i would definitely recommend this foundation more if you have skin thats on the oilier side One thing I do love about it is that it has a great shade range and is one of the only cheaper foundations that makes a shade pale enough for me so thats fabulous It also has great coverage and is super buildable and blendable its okay on my skin when paired with a hydrating primer therefore i would use it again but i do not recommend this product for gals with dry skin itll make you look crusty,0.165,0.008,0.827,0.959,Positive

Matte everything is the big trend at the moment and a matte foundation is the perfect thing for us oily skinned ladies This product certainly reduces the appearance of pores and provides great coverage however I find that it refuses to stay put on my face no matter what primer and setting spray I use It moves around on your face a lot and slides off very easily So overall Id say its a fairly average product that looks good when first applied but certainly wont stay looking that way all day,0.153,0.017,0.83,0.8734,Positive
I had heard that this particular matte foundation wasnt that great just through friends ands friends of friends but because I love matte foundation and have tried a few that have been suggested to me and They have failedI decided to try this oneand omg I LOVE this its so good on my skin and it doesnt irritate me either Its not cakey and I wore it for a few hours one day without setting spray and it was still fine when I got home  I find it blends really well also It is pricier then some Ive used but its my 1 foundation at the moment ,0.263,0.018,0.719,0.985,Positive
This foundation is my first try of Maybelline Maybellines one of those brands you can easily online or at most chain stores When they launched this new line last year I was interested to see what this would be like I purchased this in a bulk lot from Trade me because I like bargain hunting Typically in New Zealand foundations can be priced medium to high range Theres always other ways to try and find foundations and at an affordable rate like at Red Bucket sales etc My skin type is dry combination with large pores I get acne every time I try a new foundation or skincare product Thankfully not with this one,0.159,0.0,0.841,0.9403,Positive

I have recently learned from a BR pro lovely that my skin is not dry and sensitive like I previously was told  Its combination and can be quite oily in the T Zone area  I previously used the Fit Me dewy finish because I thought the shining dewy look was better for my dry skin  But little did I know that although in places it looked good in the oily areas it made it even oilier,0.155,0.0,0.845,0.8658,Positive
I wear this at night when I go out its cheap enough and does the job My friend let me use hers one time and I just had to go out and get it as well as the  smooth and dewy foundation for during the day  Great range of colours and blends in nicely,0.207,0.0,0.793,0.9062,Positive
I have very visible pores but Im not a big fan of silicone primers I dont even need to use a primer with this One of my favourites so far it keeps me matte all daycovers up my pores and has pretty good coverage The price is good considering what you get Id repurchase again definitely,0.239,0.038,0.723,0.9338,Positive
After reading all the fuss about the original Fit Me foundation I decided to give the matte and poreless version a try And I love it I love the mediumfull coverage I love the way it sits on my skin and bigger pores and I love how it covers my acneThe only thing is the colour choice with Maybelline is hit or miss when it comes to their lighter shade I feel Im in between Ivory and Classic Ivory,0.245,0.018,0.737,0.9682,Positive
i used to wear the original fit me and then tried the mattepore one and it went matte far to quickly i didnt get a chance to apply it to my skin properly and it went all patchy then i tried a friends one a few days later and it dried after i have applied it to my skin and smoothed it out,0.128,0.028,0.844,0.7319,Positive
I cant get enough of this foundation Im on my third bottle Its so easy to blend out with buildable medium coverage It stays matte long enough for every day and is fairly affordable too I took one lippie off for not having a pump on the bottle  if other Maybelline foundations have pumps why not this one,0.065,0.0,0.935,0.5777,Positive
I initially was not the biggest fan of this foundation I at first found that this didnt sit right on my skin and highlighted my large pores After some experimentation however this foundation has certainly grown on me I find that you need a well hydrated base and a good pore filling primer With these steps in place this foundation then provides a really pretty matte mediumfull coverage which I find lasts all day without looking cakey or shiny,0.136,0.025,0.839,0.8373,Positive
I really like this foundation however Im between colours which is really annoying It also would be better if it had a pump bottle It gives a buildable coverage and is matte but not too matte Lasts pretty well and doesnt get too oily on me,0.213,0.039,0.748,0.8316,Positive
I love love love this foundation I have tried so many different foundations that promise you perfection but this one doesnt lie It matches perfectly too Will definitely be buying this again,0.479,0.0,0.521,0.9645,Positive
I bought this foundation at one of the makeup sales as I had been looking at it for a while and wanted a cheap everyday foundation I found the colours for lighter skinned ladies are either too grey or too pink I went for the more grey option as my skin is already quite pink but it still wasnt quite the right colour maybe I need to try a different colour I found the coverage was medium which is good for everyday wear for me but I would choose a more high coverage foundation for the weekend It is a fairly matte formula but I still use a light powder as my skin can be quite oily towards the end of the day I will mix with another foundation to use the bottle but probably wouldnt purchase again,0.048,0.0,0.952,0.6187,Positive
I picked this up a few months ago as I was curious with the matte formula Ive tried the original Fit Me foundation years ago and although I liked it then it wasnt the best for my oily skin,0.229,0.078,0.693,0.6738,Positive

the final result,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can Nestle seed align the middle of my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

of like redness and it covered,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but everything else still looks like,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
and its great it kind of has eight like,0.485,0.0,0.515,0.765,Positive
Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt make the test result just effect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately so on my other face but half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of my face Ive been buying this one I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try to go and get to color that was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closest to it but spoiler alert it does,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
packaging theyre very similar but are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we so so happy that they came out with a,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.726,Positive
pump like this should have had a pub,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
like I wish hopefully they will add a,0.725,0.0,0.275,0.7845,Positive
pump to this foundation because its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great but its such a to just try,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
and pour it on your head and then put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but it also looks very very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose and I do think that this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is emphasizing it which is why I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally recommend to always mix it,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
with the other version I feel like it,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
makes the like perfect foundation,0.674,0.0,0.326,0.7351,Positive
because this one doesnt emphasize three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches whatsoever so if you have dry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin definitely recommend it but this,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.3818,Positive
one I do like it except around my nose,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
the super stay at full coverage,0.438,0.0,0.562,0.5994,Positive
foundation definitely has more coverage,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
and I dont feel like this emphasizes,0.0,0.297,0.703,-0.2755,Negative
the dry patches around my nose as much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
however I do think it emphasizes the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pores a little bit more right here where,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they tend to beep I mean most humans,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tend to have them right however I do you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
think you can easily fix that by,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.34,Positive
applying either a pore primer or even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just when I find my powder in a second,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youll see they does tend to help lower,0.248,0.202,0.55,0.128,Positive
them a little bit more but if you dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like to use powder in general I just,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
thought I would throw it up there so so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally I think theres some positive,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.5574,Positive
and negatives about both of these,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally I kind of find a solution,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
pretty easily especially whenever its,0.651,0.0,0.349,0.6808,Positive
something is so affordable I tend to try,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and just find a easy fix that makes them,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
worth it so for this one for example,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
like I said just the poor primers and,0.236,0.292,0.472,-0.1531,Negative
powder youre good to go,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
and this one which is the reason I only,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have my summer shade I tend to use this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
during the summer because it does help,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
control the oils and during the summer I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont have two eye patches so I dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have to deal with it during the winter I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just usually mix it with this one which,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is why this one is like super light I,0.516,0.0,0.484,0.7506,Positive
have the shade 110 so I either reuse,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this on its own or mix them together and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I feel like it makes it perfect combo,0.554,0.0,0.446,0.7351,Positive
that doesnt emphasize the dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so other than that you can see the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage is really good on my forehead,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
its not perfect but I usually dont,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.2498,Negative
tend to go for like super full coverage,0.516,0.0,0.484,0.7506,Positive
on a daily basis so I think these are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
perfect for that it covered mostly,0.425,0.0,0.575,0.5719,Positive
everything you can see you can see a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit of redness on this side to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fit anyone does it have as,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
coverage button on the forehead its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
still pretty good you can see by the way,0.466,0.0,0.534,0.7269,Positive
that the colors are pretty much matching,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
now in my face because it has oxidized,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all my hand is gonna take a little,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
longer because its a little thicker but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so if you were wondering if you have 125,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
120 will match you once its oxidized so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay so I did do the rest of my makeup,0.192,0.0,0.808,0.2263,Positive
theres actually oil coming so if you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like that I like coming but I wanted to,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.3612,Positive
show you what the foundations look like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
with the powder and everything on top so,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
Im gonna zoom you and kind of like I,0.24,0.0,0.76,0.2975,Positive
have mentioned I dont think the powder,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
changes the fact that it doesnt besides,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dry patches the pores are pretty much,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
you know normal to gone looking and this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
side I do feel like the pores are a,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
little less visible once you powder but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I mean we all have pores right so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont really blame the foundation and,0.311,0.0,0.689,0.3078,Positive
again like I said using a pore primer if,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
you are really looking to a poreless,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
look can definitely fix that issue and I,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
dont feel like it emphasizes my dry,0.0,0.26,0.74,-0.2755,Negative
patches as much now the foundation you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can see its fully oxidized now so Im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gonna apply it you like fresh swatch,0.49,0.0,0.51,0.5859,Positive
next to it so you can see how much it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
does oxidize it yeah so you can see it,0.216,0.0,0.784,0.296,Positive
is pretty oranjee compared to the shade,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
it was but if you keep that in mind I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont think its DUP difficult to find,0.0,0.294,0.706,-0.3612,Negative
your shade and Im gonna swatch the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
other one next to it just so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cuz I do think that 125 looks pretty,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
close to 120 of the full coverage once,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its socialized so you can see its good,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
in the middle I guess although the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
foundation is quite thick there I dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feel like on my face theres a,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
difference between the two right now so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so Im gonna go on with my day and I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
will be updating you probably once,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
before the energy day is currently 10,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
oclock in the morning so I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wearing this for at least 10 hours and I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention that I do have really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oily skin although during the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its not as bad but around like five or,0.425,0.0,0.575,0.634,Positive
six hours its usually when I have to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
retouch the powder and everything so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
will be doing that I hope be doing that,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
on camera whenever I feel the need to so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its nothing like the foundation are not,0.0,0.26,0.74,-0.2755,Negative
responsible for that its definitely,0.625,0.0,0.375,0.6124,Positive
just me having very oily skin in general,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but again I will update you to zoom ins,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and everything and keep you updated so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know how I said I would come back in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like five six hours touch it up that,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
didnt happen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because I do not need to I dont know if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

I was wondering the same thing One YouTuber bought a pump either from Mac or Estee Lauder for her Fit Me bottle but she said that the pump fit rather loosely and she had to be careful with storing the bottle Wouldn39t it be cool if Maybelline sold a pump separately as they seem determined not to put pumps on all their bottles of foundation The demand is already there so it seems possible from a business standpoint,0.157,0.021,0.822,0.8807,Positive

Hi honey  lt3 listen I39ve suffered on and off just like most of us have with acne and I39m sure I still will a little in future but I must confess mine hasn39t been as severe as both yours and some of us others out there Now if wearing make up is something that really makes you happy and comfortable then hey that39s perfectly fine some of us women do prefer to where make up but the message that I want to get out to you is no matter how much acne or less acne you have with andor without the make up you39ll always look beautiful  and I39m not saying that you were giving any negative message out there to those of us with acne problems because you weren39t giving out any negative message its just that there are some of us out there whom are very conscious about our imperfections and sometimes we do let our skin problems get the better of us but seriously honey with all due sincerity and respect you39ll always look beautiful with andor without the make up with andor without acne and this message also goes out to the rest of both us women and men out there with acne prone andor non acne prone skin  lt3,0.185,0.104,0.711,0.9692,Positive

Great video Shes so beautiful Id like to share this on here knowing that there will be quite a bit of viewers who may suffer from acne This is from research and from my own experience Acne is usually hormonal and cant be treated with topicals You need a combination of birth control pills that help regulate your hormones and Spironolactone youll need a prescription from your doctor which helps control your bodys production of androgens which causes acne Ive suffered from hormonal acne most of my 20s until I started this medication regime This is the only thing that works So if you have severe acne its most likely whats going inside of your body hormones endocrine issues Diet and exercise as well as sleep are crucial for achieving good skin I just wanted to share that surprisingly most women still dont know this about acne and how to treat it,0.181,0.054,0.765,0.9645,Positive

Hi My son had the same kind of acne as you when he was youngerwe tried everything for several yearsnothing worked It would clear and come back worse than before with some of prescribed creams Finally i had the opportunity to ask an estetician he told me baking soda wash 3 per day Equal parts of water and baking soda by making a paste and using it as a facial scrub Secondly he said to follow up with organic raw apple cider vinegar 25 amp  distilled water mixture 75 toner It worked We kept in refridgerator He saw results within 2 weeks He then started to cut back To twice a day until it cleared This was 8 years ago The scaring is minimal  He maintains once a day in shower still to this day His acne is gone forever now Keep following up wth a water based moisturizer like you are I really hope this helps you and understand this is not a dis to you at all in any way shape or form  Your makeup looks great God Bless,0.128,0.059,0.812,0.9066,Positive

I apologize I know everyone is commenting on the acne just have to share this my son had severe acne starting at 11 years old I put him on acutane and other facial creams prescriptions to clear him up after we finished it immediately started to come back  What we did to cure him was go cold turkey on DAIRY  No milk no cheese no yoghurt no morning cereal no ice cream nothing nothing nothing  He cleared up and was completely fully clear by 16 years old and it never came back  We started drinking Almond milk mostly the chocolate flavoured he still drinks pop eats chips eats candy still nothing  I39m clear now too and I used to break out cystic majorly on my back too  The other thing I find I break out with is 39creamy39 shampoo and absolutely hair conditioner really makes my neck break out if I don39t rinse it out properly  Try to quit hopefully this helps someone out there,0.104,0.077,0.819,0.5746,Positive

When I was 21 I had a horrible breakout on the lower sides of my face I came across some neutrogena at my exs brothers house and tried it My skin cleared in a week or two but I saw results everyday  Heres my advice For severe acne wash your face 3x with a deep cleaning neutrogena that contains alpha and beta hydroxy acid DO NOT put any type of moisturizer on EVER Your skin neeeds to dry out Putting moisturizer and makeup in inflamed pores filled with dirt and bacteria is devastation  My skin routine is so dope I can skip days of using my products and my skin stays clear I also aged better Since neutrogena discontinues products every couple of years I noticed the common denominator of each new product that I found worked for me was a deep cleaner that contains the two acids even if I have to find 2 different washes and combine them in my skin routine Also I never ever use rags on my face or pat dry after I love makeup but when I dont wear it I get compliments that I look better without it Recently my mom told my sister I look flawless and my cousin saw me and told me my skin is soft like a babys butt Things I never heard before Conclusion if your going to wear makeup anyway do a power wash in the  am  Wet face Rub product with a dap of water until it gets foamy Rub in circles around your whole face for about 30 secs wash with warm water repeat 2 or 3x Apply makeup As soon as you get home power wash with the same routine At night do another power wash Eventually youll have to do less and less Its amazing Once your skin is under control you can start dabbling in different types of lotions but dont get happy Also doing it in a steamy shower gives you faster and better quality results  I hope this article changes a lot of lives because my breakout was nasty but once I found a routine I realized it gives my skin a better smoother toned complexion No pores good luck If you try my routine for about a month reply your results,0.141,0.07,0.789,0.985,Positive

Your video was so refreshing to see especially the quality Every time I see a make up tutorial they always have such smooth faces and like there39s no perfection When I apply make up I always see so many imperfections when I am looking I39m looking in the mirror  I39m like am I the only one that see it I39m not saying you got imperfections but  considering you adjusted the lighting and your face in close to the camera that39s what I should be seeing in the other videos because I know no one got a perfect ass skin so I felt relived to know that this is how it should look like and I wasn39t just being paranoid Because sometimes I do I39ll look so good in some mirrors and my skin looks smooth and then look like shit in some mirrors So basically I just wanted to say I39m happy I39m not the only one,0.157,0.095,0.748,0.9003,Positive

I used to have acne and I was on and off accutane for about 6 years Low dose  about 10mg I tried doxycycline at one stage but it was actually a lot harsher than accutane on my skin and I had serious issues with sun damage  I would never recommend it over accutane At the beginning of last year I decided I was sick of accutane and did not want to spend my life on it because I worried about my health but my skin looked AMAZING when I was on it I went off it and after about a month my acne returned and my oil production was absolutely out of control I have finally found a really great brand of skincare that operates to penetrate below the epidermal layer and my skin is pretty much as good as it was when I was on accutane although I still produce more oil than when I was on it I definitely think it is a good idea to talk to somebody who knows a thing or two about skin care  curology sounds like a really good source for that I know how hard it is to live with acne it destroys confidence But thank you for creating a YouTube channel and being so honest about it And for being so graceful when people comment use apple cider vinegar or you need to wash your face every night  dont you know we do that Acne is a medical condition  it aint linked to hygiene because I wash and moisturize my face religiously and have done so since I was in my teens All the best for your journey and I hope you continue to create great content,0.234,0.087,0.679,0.9958,Positive

I dont care for this foundation either it makes my skin look too matte if that makes any sense I only use a little bit bc a little goes a long way but I still end up looking like I put on pounds of make up I have combo oily skin but this foundation made my skin appear dry andflat for lack of a better word It covered my skin a little too well making it appear so unnatural I know next to nothing about make up though and was just looking for a cheap foundation to wear every now and then so I may have applied it wrong or gotten a shade that wasn39t quite right for me,0.08,0.076,0.844,0.1074,Positive

I recently purchased and tried this foundation in a 330 and I like it Like she said it feels light weight gives me good coverage although I didn39t feel that it gave me an unnatural look Before this I used Clinique stay matte in 21 cream caramel but it had an orangered undertone that bothered me I hated that so I needed something quick to try This new Fit me formula for darker skin tones at least is a good one Its true to my skin tone at least and doesn39t try to over compensate with the orange undertone to try and hide imperfections,0.142,0.095,0.763,0.5346,Positive

I love this foundation I dab it all over my face with my finger then spread it a little with my fingers And even it out with a damp beauty blender It is my new favorite foundation It does not apply well with a brush and is best used with a Beauty blender I dab any extra over trouble spots I want to cover and blend that out as well for best coverage,0.285,0.074,0.641,0.9646,Positive
Please blot and take away the oil first and then powder Blot with blotting paper or a tissue and the use a brush or puff to reapply powder because putting powder on your puff and directly on top of the oil will cause the bacteria to be on the puff And then you put the put back in the powder to get more which transfers bacteria on the powder itself and your face,0.056,0.0,0.944,0.4767,Positive

I think this foundation would39ve worked so much better for you if it had been set with powder I have normalslightly dry skin amp I always set with powder I love this foundation I wear it over a good moisturizer apply with a beauty blender amp lightly set it with translucent powder Also when you start to get oily don39t go straight in with powder Blot away the excess oil first with tissue or blotting papers then apply a light amount of powder to reset the foundation Going straight in with powder creates cake face because the oil amp powder mix Hope this helps,0.229,0.0,0.771,0.9747,Positive

There are two different versions of this foundation There is one for dewy  smooth and matte  pore less I tried both foundations I have oily skin and I39m dry around my nose and forehead I used the dewy  smooth version in the shade 220 and I didnt like it I thought it looked unnatural but it was okay because i didn39t have the correct shade 220 was too light for me Then I got the matte  poreless foundation and got it in the shade 228 Hands down the BEST foundation for me I LOVE IT It looks super natural and it doesn39t crease It has medium to full coverage I use the real techniques buffing brush I think the reason Judy39s review wasn39t so accurate was because on the day to day basis you would moisturize and use primer then set it with powder but Judy didn39t I never really comment on videos but I had to for this one I39ve tried about 10 foundations and maybelline39s fit me Matte  poreless is my absolute favorite,0.17,0.008,0.822,0.9877,Positive
