Thank you Maybelline foundation for finding me! I had given up wearing foundation years ago after Clinique stopped making their sports make-up foundation. Maybelline for normal to dry skin is just as high a quality as Clinique! It may even be better because the other car no my allows me to buy more shade variations.Now I own several variations of colors ranging from porcelain and ivory to nude buff considering which part of my face gets the foundation.I am a visual artist (painter) so this make-up thing should be easy for me. The issue has been a battle for economy together with quality. With Maybelline I have found both economy and quality.Thank you Amazon and Maybelline ♥️
I love it. Doesn’t clog my pores and my skin is GLOWING!! I do not like the thick matte type foundation and this is very light and doesn’t feel heavy. I’ve used many many MANY foundations in my life and this is by far my favorite of all time!
I love how this makeup feels on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and other products cause me to break out. I am 35yrs old and have rosacea and I get flare ups when using other products this product works great for my skin and is my go to I highly recommend.
I purchased this foundation in fair porcelain to mix with a make up I have + like in medium and it worked  just fine for that. Other than that this shade is for the exceptionally exceptionally pale. A hard to find shade when it's what you seek, but this would look too chalky and pale on most people.
I love how smooth this foundation is. It literally gives you full coverage from the first application not to mention it last all day ( make sure you put on primer). Definitely one of my Go To’s and fave !
I was looking for a foundation to cover my super red skin due to constant rosacea flare ups. (I also have textured skin with large pores). I’m not a professional when it comes to makeup and I have spent entirely to much money trying products that just didn’t work for me.  But, I took a chance on this one because of the super affordable price. So beyond happy that I did. My skin feels hydrated, looks dewy, and it covers my redness without feeling like I need to apply half of the bottle. Glad I tried something other than a matte finish as I now know it’s just not compatible with my skin. I do not use a setting powder, just a setting spray. And finally… I found something that makes me feel confident enough to take a selfie without a filter. I will definitely buy more of this foundation!
Doesn’t do full coverage and my face got oily. But the price was good. The Matt one is better.
Its sheer, the color is good , moisturing and is good for mature skin. no clumping in lines and wrinkles
Easy to spread and doesn't look caked on....that's a benefit. However, I feel like my skin looks oily and orange. The color match seems off, too. I purchased the powder compact in the same shade and it was perfect, yet the liquid foundation in the same shade was too dark for my skin.
I love how this goes on. It’s not too dewy, but just right. It’s a medium coverage and my favorite. I use it every day.
This was gonna be my new go to foundation I been using the same foundation for 20 years. It was 3.50 when I purchased it to try went back 2 days later to get more since I liked it and it was 7 dollars ugh.. but still worth 7 bucks.
I must rave about this foundation. I normally put on powder and call it good. The other day I decided to give this a try and I am impressed. We live in Kentucky and It is very humid here. I did my makeup and headed out to run school arans, I was nervous about stopping at the farmers market with the new makeup on and the fact that we are dealing with 87% humidity right now. I gave it a go and went into the heat and did my shopping. I came back to the truck and looked into the mirror to find that not only was the makeup still perfect, it has a nice dewey glow to it which made my face look even more natural. I went ahead and ordered a shade down to add to my collection so I can use it during winter when my tan is gone.
Easy to use and easy to spread on face.
lovee it
This makeup gives my skin a smooth natural look.  Sometimes it’s hard to tell that I’m wearing makeup.  I love it!
Don't seen no more like it but have enough thanks
I have tried many different brands of foundation and this is the one that works the best on my skin. I was looking for something with full coverage that wouldn't be cakey or make my skin feel suffocated. In fact, I bought three different brands of foundation on the same day. One was $40, one was $14, and then this one which I paid $4, I think it was on sale. I prefered this product over the other two.
I have worn this brand and color for along time awhile back it was getting difficult to find, but of course I found it here better price and delivered right to me. Thank you Amazon.
The best drugstore foundation for dry skin. I’ve used this in a variety of shades because I self tan and I love them. Affordable, medium coverage and comes in lots of shades. I range from light to medium skin tones.
Good light-medium coverage foundation it's worth it but you need to moisturize very well before you put it on.
Really good foundation for Asian skin! Has an orange undertone! Looks natural and dewy!
I have bought this product three times already and two different colors and love both of them just ran out will be buying another one. Better than morph Sephora and revolution
Good consistency, was unsure of what the "dewy"aspect would look like but was pleasantly surprised with outcome. Will buy again
I love love this foundation. Easiest to blend and spread. I love using this with my beauty blender.
I love this foundation!  It does NOT look cakey!
Fast shipping and good product in general.
Just received this today and was immediately disappointed by the shade. I wear shade 110 in the Maybelline Fit Me matte+poreless foundation. I’ve worn it for years and I’ve never had an issue. I also have shade 120 (dewy+smooth) and 330 in the same line. I use the 120 as a summer shade or bronzer in the winter time, and the 330 as a contour. I find that contouring and bronzing with foundation lasts longer, blends better, and gives a more natural look.The pictures are lineups of all of the foundations and the one I’m reviewing is moved forward so you can tell the difference. Please excuse the background, my vanity is an antique secretary desk so it’s not exactly photogenic lol. The one I purchased in this order is shade 110 in the Dewy+Smooth and it’s darker than the shade 120 from the same line. How is that possible? Very disappointed. I’m guessing it’s a knock-off, but if it isn’t it’s extremely annoying that Maybelline would mislabel the foundation like this. 110 is almost exactly my skin tone and 120 is what I use if I have a tan.Second pic is the lids, again the one I’m reviewing is moved forward.The third pic is all of them a watched on my skin and blended at the bottom to see coverage and true color. I stuck my arm next to an open window so you can get natural light and see it more clearly. The order from elbow to hand is: 110 (this one), 110 matte+poreless, 120, 330. I have a bit of a tan on my arm now from driving, so I’m getting into my summer shade on my arm (face is lighter) but you can pretty clearly see that this 110 is WAY darker than the actual 110 matte+poreless and a bit darker than 120 dewy+smooth. It’s also more of an orangey shade than the 120 is. DEFINITELY NOT PORCELAIN. (Again, the 330 is a contour shade so chill lol)The fourth pic is the same as the 3rd, just at my vanity so you can see it under different lighting.The fifth pic is the backs of each. You can clearly see the difference in labeling. I will say: the shade 120 that I have has different labeling from all of them, so I’m guessing that is a change by Maybelline, and I’m very willing to accept that 120 is a possible knock off (I also ordered on Amazon), but either way shade 110 in matte+poreless and dewy+smooth should not be this different.Very disappointing. For less than $4 I’m not going to return it, but I’m bummed because I’m out of my foundation and now I’m stuck with a shade I can’t use for a long time. The consistency feels the same and the bottles are constructed the same. Three stars solely because it’s still not a bad product.
Amazon often has fit me a lot cheaper (like70%)than the stores, so I can get several colors which is nice, because I don’t like my face all one color, fit me is a buildable foundation, & can look really natural. It does tend to slide off, I assume if you set it was powder, it would hold better, although I do use settings spray still seems to slide off abit. But can’t beat it’s natural but nice coverage, and maybe my primer just doesn’t work well with it??
I love this foundation
Creamy, smooth
Best foundation I've found
I love this foundation.  It spreads easy and has good coverage.  This is awesome foundation at a great price. Get some and you will not be disappointed!
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Not patchy, feels good on the skin, and good coverage. Good value for money
I did the mistake of getting the wrong shade but even with the formula it makes my face look very cakey. This used to be my go to but discovered other foundations that fit my face better.
I like this foundation, but the Dewy version of fair/porcelain is a shade darker than the Matte version
I love this foundation. Covers well but not too thick. Does not feel heavy. The coverage is very  natural. Have been using it for years.
Great coverage
I have been using this product for years and am very happy with how it looks on my skin and how it feels.
Great blend I use with the moisturizing foundation together
its a good foundation but I got a tiny bit to light of a shade but its definitely a nice and spreadable foundation
It’s my favorite  foundation now. <3
Goes on smooth.  Great coverage
It's foundation on a budget
I reintroduced myself to this company just recently after not using any Maybelline products for easily over 20+ years (I am in my 40s). I bought it because I saw a MUA try it online and they raved about it. I couldn’t agree more. I love a full face of make up (because I have sun spots/melasma), however I don’t want it to feel cakey to the touch or even when you put it on. This foundation is super buildable which is great, goes on easily and doesnt oxidize. I have used high end foundations and this one is wayyy up there on the list of my favorites. Dont let high end companies fool you into thinking makeup has to be expensive in order to be good. Its all about good products and techniques/application. The pic in the jean jacket is from my birthday- I wouldn’t  wear the foundation on my special day if I didn’t think it was great! Other pic and vid are from shortly before, and you can see it looks flawless on skin!!!! - Full face of makeup but not caked on! I promise you wont be disappointed!! I hope this helps!!
I love the product because it spreads on easy and gives a smooth coverage. It also keeps my face moisturized.
Maybelline has upped their game. This foundation is as good as any expensive department store product I have used. I’m thrilled to save so much money without sacrificing quality.
My favorite one, is my to go foundation. Blends very well, natural effect, the skin seems shiny and healthy.
I only in the past few years started using liquid foundation to cover up these micro spider veins on my face. works great, and just a dab goes a long way. very light weight, and blends in with my skin tone well!
Love fit me my go to all the time
This NY Fit Me foundation is lovely .... all the manufacturer claims it to be.  This is not my first time purchase, and I will be back for more.  The coverage is so nice. It never cakes up in the facial lines, and lasts all day of normal activity.  Maybelline is certainly a brand name you can trust!!
Color matches my skin well, and it leaves my skin with a dewy glow. Covers well.
It is pretty easy to blend out but the problem I have with it is that it’s too dewy.
I mean it's good for the price 🤷🏼‍♀️ it came a little smaller than I thought but that was my fault 😅I WOULD RECOMMEND GOING FOR A LIGHTER COLOR!! I got the porcelain 110.It doesn't have any type of dispenser so it might be a little hard to take the foundation out of the bottle without making any mess.It does the job, it's not full coverage in case you want to know.It's light weight and you can't really feel it once you put it on.It doesn't make your skin dry or oily.It does cover redness, you can still see your freckles which is what I wanted, but I know some people won't like that.
Great for dry skin. Sheer coverage but you can build it up nicely. Last all day.
I got the wrong shade but it still worked great
My favorite foundation and sooo much cheaper then anywhere else!
I bought this on TikTok recommendation…. Amazing! Goes on smooth. Wears all day comfortably. Blends nicely too. Great daily foundation
First order came broke.  Returned them got new ones.  The product is nice.  Now the  seller is charging me double cause they claim they didn't get the broken ones back. Product good, but make sure it's right cause the seller ain't right.
I love this one. I have normal to sometimes a bit dry skin and this one has the perfect coverage for me without looking like a “cake”. I just need a little bit of it because my skin is pretty clean. It leaves my skin dewy (which I like) and is easy to apply. Unfortunately, these doesn’t come with a pump, I really don’t like that. In Europe those foundation comes with a pump in each bottle so you don’t have to worry about getting too much out of the bottle. That’s why only 4 stars.I picked ivory shade but found out it’s a tiny bit “darker” then the fit me matte and poreless foundation which is a bit annoying but next time I try the lighter shade or mix it a little bit.
I’m dark skin and have oily skin this makeup did cover the lighter pigmentation in my skin only apply little or esle you’ll have to scrub to get it offI had to order another color to get tone I needed but it didn’t rub off on clothes or when I hugged people I would buy again
I don't feel it really stays in place but I do love how it looks when it does stay put
I’m happy with this make-up, it blends well.  I mix it with another kind and it looks really good!!!
I love this foundation it's my favourite
Immensely outstanding quality! Notably fast dispatch. Would buy from again. First-class service. Recommended.
I literally wear this product all the time and have no complaints. Personal it’s affordable and your getting your moneys worth
Been using this for years. Love the color and how it doesn’t dry out the skin
The best of this product is that the material is so easy to  spread. However, it doesn’t come with a special applicator so its difficult to take it out of the container without making a mess
I got shade102. This is everything for a nice no makeup makeup look or a natural beat. I’m not super into glamming it up with high coverage thick makeup beat to the gods, so this is great for me. I don’t really wear make up all the time, but when I do I like a nice medium coverage. I do have acne scarring and hyperpigmentation as well as very fair neutral skin. (Like I’m truly Casper the friendly ghost in the winter and neutral af so unless it’s truly neutral it will look either to pink or to orange aka crazy foundation mask) that side note being said it runs a touch pink but I warmed it up with bronzer and it was fine. I’d say this is light coverage that is buildable to medium. I have dry sensitive skin as well so you can imagine the struggle to find something that works. We have a winner here this stuff didn’t break me out! Hallelujah! I will say I love a “natural” finish but I do have texture and it shows, however that’s not the foundation‘s fault. I have texture no matter what primer or foundation I use especially because I like a dewy more natural finish. Get it foundation even if ur on the fence it was like 4 bucks so you can’t go wrong even if you don’t like it.
Smells good but I picked the wrong shade .
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
I like the price of this product but it is hard to know what shade to purchase. I ended up buying the wrong shade and just mixing it was other foundation. It is also a bit oily for my skin, but it does tend to last a last all day.

I am SHOOK.I have been looking for my perfect color match since 2018 - I used to use Lancome Teint Idol in 555 (not 555 Suede C, which is the replacement of the former; the shade 555 has been discontinued, unfortunately), and since they switched everything up, I have just been throwing dollars at makeup to find or make my perfect shade. Between adding pigments, buying and mixing foundations, and taking online quizzes like the one for Il Makiage and those found on Findation.com, I was just lost.I needed to re-up on foundation, since all the ones I bought last year before the pandemic were starting to get a lil crusty, to say the least -This was on sale, and I figured "why not, I literally have nothing to lose... except like, five bucks."I received it in the mail today, and looked at it, and was disappointed."This gon make me look ashy as hell", I thought.BUT BOY WAS I WRONG!!!I put it on my face and nearly screamed.Listen - to all my chocolate humans out there... this... this might be the one, yo lol.ALSO, CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE SKIN FEEL???? LIKE, okay, sorry, screaming - BUT ALSO?? LOLLike, we all love a little matte moment, especially when the pores are opening up like they're fulfilling their live's dream of being moon craters, but also, when the skin is acting right, and we just want a dewy, moiskerized, even tone to match our silky smooth base?! THIS. IS. THE. ONE! PERIOD!For those wondering about undertone and stuff like that, I would say that I have a rather warm or neutral tone (Yellows oranges and golds are my colors), but I've been told that I have cooler, rosy undertones (I also love greens and blues, but they just don't flatter me in the same way). Whichever I am, this foundation feels like it's undertones are spot on for my skin.All in all? 10/10. I'd say if you feel like you have a similar tone to me, this foundation may work in your favor.Have a blessed day poo!!
GREAT for Mature Skin
I love this ! And always have. One downside is the smile lines it gives you.
This is my go to foundation! It’s cheap and looks good on me!
Always use this makeup. Goes on smooth
bought shade 110 porcelain,  way too dark for me. it is however very dewy and medium coverage,  but feels like it would require a setting powder.
I got this foundation because it was on sale and I’ve always wanted to try it and I’m really surprised that I was able to get my color through Amazon pretty well. The color matches nice and I actually really enjoy this foundation, lol. I never would’ve thought jus bc it was on sale on Amazon.. lol
It’s alright it was not exactly what I was looking for.
I love this foundation, it is especially so much cheaper on amazon, this worked so perfectly for my dry skin, it is so easy to use and look so good.
I love the foundation hate the color
This is MY foundation. The only one I will ever use
Good product, I would go a little lighter next time I order
Love fit me
Incredible foundation especially for the price. It is a quality formula that is buildable and isn’t cakey. Perfect and lightweight for everyday wear. LOVE it.
I was searching for a cheaper alternative for my Clinique and Tarte foundations. While the color match was pretty good, my face broke out in acne after using this product. I have worn it several times to verify the product caused the acne, which it did for me.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
What a high quality product for a little price. I hope they never discontinue making it. My color was perfect. It went on sheer and did not cake. There was really nothing to clean off as it was moisturizing.You won’t be disappointed if you purchase it.
Not bad for middle age skin. Does help with looking too matte for my mature skin. Will purchase again.
When the old style Revlon Age Defying Liquid Makeup / Foundation was discontinued, i tried so many foundations but they were either like water or like putting cement on my face.  This foundation is now my new go-to foundation.  Spreads well and covers perfectly.  Great color match too!
I was a bit dubious about color matching online and using a cheap product but it’s my absolute favorite foundation ever. It goes on really smoothly, covers well and feels like nothing there. I was a bit worried when I got it because it looks darker in the bottle but it’s a perfect match for me. Will never buy expensive again!
It’s medium to full coverage and the amount you get is good for the price.  If you wear a primer, it is moisturizing.  I like that is has spf, but I still wear extra sunscreen.  Overall, it works pretty well.
so cheap and real. buy it here and not double the price in store!
Bella
Goes on smooth,good coverage and great price
This is the best foundation I have used in a long long time. I have a very big issue with foundations being extremely drying on my face. I guess I have dry skin especially now in the winter I get small dry patches that are honestly not even noticeable until I put foundation on depending on the foundation. This foundation applies so easily and smoothly and does not cling to any dry skin on my face. The coverage is buildable maybe not to full coverage but definitely buildable to medium. I have spent around 60 dollars for bareminerals pro foundations (got two of em) and they looked horrifying on me. Made my skin super dry and flaky and looked cakey. I cant believe a 4 dollar foundation beat the expensive ones by a lotttt. This is the best foundation if you want to look flawless dewy and moisturized. Obviously would look better on normal to dry skin. Get this you won’t regret it!!! (Don’t forget your primer and setting powder, makes all the difference)
Wife loves this brand foundation it's her #1 go too budget foundation
I strongly recommend finding your color match in a drugstore, and then buying a few extras online if you really love it. I bought one of these for an event, thought I had the correct color, and I ended up having to wipe my makeup off and start from scratch because of how pale I looked. A little definitely goes a long way. I'd even mix a few drops into your moisturizer to make a tinted moisturizer. Unless you really know your shade, don't buy this online.
This liquid makeup is so smooth and sheer and it goes on great. I needed to replace my previous makeup and this one is great.
This foundation is great. Bleands beautifully and is not too heavy
Got this foundation on a sale and I love how easy it is to spread on my face . I have dry skin so sometimes I end up with patches while using a liquid foundation but with  this one I experienced no such patches . This “ Fit me” foundation is a keeper . I will be buying more “fit me” products . I’m really happy with my purchase.
I was looking for an inexpensive weekend product.It does the job, but is super “watery”.
Not sealed
I read a great article on this item and decided to try. It is a very sheer formula (needs shaking each time), spreads easily no pooling or min creasing hrs later. It does have a nice moisturizing effect, slight dewey but not shiny. I think it’s a nice natural finish that didn’t cause breakouts to my sensitive skin. Worth a try…
This is my go to foundation. Affordable and perfect. Get it
I got it a little to light and is quite watery
It feels smooth and light on my skin
I'm pale but not incredibly so, and I wear this foundation in the shade 120. The photo shows the product on my wrist, which is definitely paler than my face, so you can see the color really well.overall, no complaints. I like this better than the matte+poreless foundation because it is made for dry skin and also has SPF 18.I've only ever tried this and the matte+poreless foundation, so I can't speak to how it measures up to other brands, but I've never felt the need to try anything else out because this works really well for me.
This was a foundation that was a beautiful shade and wonderfully dewy.  But it had such an unpleasant fragrance, I could not tolerate it.  It's a shame.
I forgot my base make up on a recent trip and ordered this. Excellent price for a good product. I’m not switching from my go to makeup but it was a good substitute in a pinch. I was at the beach so a shear coverage was appropriate.
The product is okay not the best but okay
Maybelline fit me has always been my favorite! It looks gorgeous on and it applies beautifully! Always my go to!
Just started wearing makeup because I cheer and so far so good.
Coming from someone with acne prone, oily skin; I was a grease pit in a few hours. To save from having a savage breakout, I washed it off after 3 hours. In the winter this might be okay. May have to try it again then. Great price point! As for the shade range… it went from too pasty white to too orange. I mixed two 105 and 102 together matched somewhat closer to my skin tone.. not really though. It has buildable coverage and it did settle into fine lines a bit. I didn’t want to push it too far an cake it on because I was not sure how my oily skin would like it. Apparently not so much. I tested it on my arm first… it was very smooth and blurred a bit. So for those of you with drier skin, this will be perfect.
The shade I picked is a good match for my skin color. Foundation is sheer and provides a nice glow without shine.
Soooo oily /:
I am in love with this foundation. It’s so smooth 😍😍 I ordered a few shades too dark so I reordered a lighter shade.
Enjoying this foundation, great color range and buildable coverage. Covers everything that needs to be covered and lasts all night
This makeup is nice and buildable. if you apply a little bit it's just enough to cover up darker blemishes and make your skin tone look even. It is so moisturizing without feeling oily never feel like my face is getting dry throughout the day when I apply it over my lotion. Some other brands kind of seem to suck up the moisture from my lotion and eventually look cakey or cracky. What I've noticed about this the most is that it has one of the smoothest looks of any makeup I've tried. It never looks overdone or like a mask. it literally never settles in creases and is so spreadable. I still cannot find my exact skin tone so I apply a little bit of orangey ccostume makeup  with it which is hilarious but it works great together.  I think the vitamin e in this product really helps me before I was using my current moisturizer I was using a much oilier moisturizer and I would always mix in  vitamin e because it's great for healing scars and it's good for my skin personally even though it breaks out some other people's. I have not noticed this at all breaking me out even nights when I leave it on from tiredness. It has almost no noticeable fragrance at all which is great. And it is so cheap on Amazon which is awesome.
This Foundation is a little runny -kept it anyway- I just mix it with my other foundation to add color
I have been using this foundation since it first came out and haven’t ever used anything else! I mix this one with the matte and poreless! Use 118 and 120. I get tons of compliments on my skin at age 60! Between my skin care routine and this foundation being so light, but has coverage it makes my skin look young and dewy(not caked)!!
Great product just a little off in color. Kinda dry when you put it on. It's supposed to be Dewey. Also the color isn't right. I'm fair skinned and color was off it was to light. So I give 4 stars
Nice price for the product.
Honestly was not expecting to love this product. Ive been using a $40 professional foundation for YEARS and it was recently discontinued so i figured I'd try this stuff just to see if would hokd me over until i could get to ulta to have a sales person help me find a new expensive foundation. I did not expect my search to end at a $4 bottle of drugstore makeup. But it did. This foundation is lightweight, dewy and..it covers my sun spots flawlessly!! Im 47. Never in a million years did i think id fall in love with a cheap drugstore foundation..but here we are. Obsessed. This stuff is fantastic!
Can't say enough about how satisfied I am with this product!  Feels like a dream to wear.
I originally bought this foundation for a night out because I don't wear foundation normally. Pretty much every day I just have concealer under my eyes and on some blemishes set with powder and I'm ready for the day.Now, I did get it maybe a shade or so too dark, but I had enough time to order another shade to mix and got my perfect shade.First off, this foundation is about a medium coverage. I don't have problem skin, but I have the usual redness and a few acne scars here and there. My only problem are severe dark circles that are unfortunately genetic and I don't expect any foundation to begin to cover up, hence the concealer that I mentioned earlier. This foundation builds up nicely, though I really only did a base layer and a thin second layer around my nose and forehead because of acne scarring and redness. In no way is this cakey or thick and uncomfortable- unless of course you pile a ridiculous amount on your skin, which would make any foundation look pretty bad.The consistency of this foundation is kind of liquid-y, but not super runny and hard to work with. I apply pretty much all foundation makeup with either a damp beauty sponge or a buffing kabuki brush (like the Real Techniques Expert Face or Buffing brushes). I tried both and found that they both work equally well, but I tend to favor brushes so I applied it with a flat top kabuki, making sure to buff and blend, but not too much as to blend the foundation right away.Now, I found that even though I have combination skin (oily in t-zone, pretty dry around brows and cheeks), I only had to touch up once throughout the night. Three hours of pretty much continuous dancing and I barely saw any oil forming. Now I did set this with a powder beforehand, but I could have probably gone without. This foundation didn't wear off or separate throughout the whole night and the finish was great. Good job Maybelline!!PROS:-Great price-Amazing finish-Good lasting power-Nice consistency and feel, almost like nothing is on your face-FANTASTIC color selection, even better in-store!CONS:-I got the wrong color at first, but that's really my fault because I didn't see the color in person-If you have very oily skin, you may want to see if you will like this, but I know some of my friends who use this with oily skin and love it, but it's personal preference really!
Not a bad product. It is really watery like. It blended in pretty good on my dry skin. It lasted for a little while.
I used to wear foundation in the 90s, when the stuff was so thick you needed a paint roller to apply.  I guess sometime in the early 2000s I stopped wearing liquid foundation and switched mineral powder, though I wasn't completely thrilled with it.  I then moved on to tinting my facial moisturizer with my mineral powder.  A few years ago I discovered Burt's Bees BB Cream, which for the most part I was ok with.  Then just a few weeks ago I saw FitMe on sale and I thought, "Why not?" So as I'm applying it,  I thought,  "Ugh, I can't believe I'm putting this stuff... OMG... this is soooooooooo easy! I love this stuff."  So now I'm like, "Why didn't anyone tell me about this?!"  Jealous people don't want anyone else looking good? I don't know. This is great. I can only hope they won't change the formula.
I have been looking forever for a truly dewy foundation and I can't believe this is it! I have spent up to $50 on others with disappointing results. My skin is always dry, no matter how much I moisturize and matte foundations only highlight my fine lines. This is super light, dewy, and leaves my skin looking radiant while hiding my fine lines.
A little of this product goes a long way.
Overall I think the quality of the foundation is very good - smooth and even. It does have a brown tone to it that does not with with pink toned skin though, so not for me. Also the bottle was open in the package and leaked everywhere...
I love this foundation in matte but sometimes my skin is too dry for it. I bought the same shade (220) in this dewy finish to mix together or use instead on days when my skin is dry. It works great but is a little darker than the same shade in matte.
I've tried many big name and drug store brand foundations, I keep coming back to this one. The color in the 2nd picture is 105 fair ivory, picture 1 is 115 ivory, which is a fair amount darker. I like having both on hand, and use 115 more in the Summer months when my skin is a little sun kissed.I like how easy it spreads with a small amount. It has a light to medium buildable coverage. I just use 1 light layer and blend with sponge, this blend doesn't get stuck in fine lines like some other brands I've tried. The dewy formula is moisturizing for dry skin. Amazing quality at  low price.
Love it!
I am giving this 5 stars even though I returned it.  It was not the right color match for my skin.  I think it would have been quite nice if it matched my skin better
I have combo skin, mostly oily with some dry patches and I live in a humid climate. This is my second favorite foundation across all price points. The first favorite is the matte and poreless fit me foundation! When I try to use up one of my other expensive ones, I come back to this. Note the matte and poreless line has slightly different colors - 118 and 128 are more olive. Matte and poreless matches me perfectly, but I still  prefer this one when I have dry patches.
Adequate coverage, but looks best when applied with a damp beauty blender and then set with a light dusting of translucent powder. Setting spray is good too!
I never thought I could wear an ivory shade but this is the nearest my skin tone.  Sheer buildable for areas needing a little more coverage. I do add a light dusting of Mineral Veil powder because I like a little less dewy feeling.  Love the Fit Me foundation.  Wish it had a sunscreen added.
Light weight feel with medium coverage. It isn't sweat proof and doesn't last all night but I wear to work in an office environment and it gets the job done.
It didn’t break my face out.  A little to orangey for me, I am african american its hard to find good over the countervpick foundation but might be good to mix with other foundation. Did love it but didn’t hate it.
I was looking for an alternative, less pricey, dewey looking, but covering, foundation. This works great! I love that it isn't heavy, especially for the warmer months. It has a nice light coverage and matches my skin well.
I'm not much of a foundations person but this stuff is great! It doesn't go on too thick but it has good coverage. I'll definitely be buying it again.
I've used this off and on over the last couple years and now it is making my skin itch. I am not sure if it is me or the formula. It was shipped and packed well so no complaints there. It has a little color and goes on smoothly. I did not find it moisturizing, it was actually a little dry and cakey on my 60 year old skin. It might work for someone younger.
You will love this one
Very sheer and watery.
I ve been having dry patches since the weather changed so i had to get something moistrizing with some coverage to it, and believe me if u have the same problem , this is what u should get!Ps : i have an acne prone skin and this foundation didn’t make me break at all which was impressive , i usually just stick to 1 foundation because I always break out whenever i try something new
The shade was okay, but i have very pale skin and i definitely had to mix this with something to both lighten it and counteract the yellow, i used nyx lavender color corrector and a little bit of the foundation on the back of my hand and blended until it turned lighter so i could use it. I got 102 the lightest shade
Not great foundation, but it’s not bad for that price.
I wear this all the time it looks great
This is some really good makeup..the only thing is the bottle wasn't sealed but it didn't look used so I took a chance
Blends seamlessly. Coverage is a little light though.
Perfect
I have this foundation in both the matte & poreless and the dewey & fresh and I have them in the same shade number - which, I understand, is supposed to be universal across the Fit Me line. However, this one is a bit darker/warmer than the same number (which is 110, by the way) than the Matte & Poreless version. I think the coverage is excellent and it has a great texture/consistency. It also wells pretty darn well and is easy to blend and layer if you need fuller coverage. My only complaint is the tone. The 110 in the M&P is a near-perfect match for my skin, but as my skin tends to skew dry, it really only works for me in the summer (when I generally need a slightly darker shade, go figure). I wish the tones were reversed because that would be perfect! But if you are looking for an affordable foundation that has great coverage and is easy to work with, I absolutely recommend the Fit Me line!
It's a nice foundation. Beautiful in fact if you can match correctly. Goes on nice and not thick. I had to order twice as my normal color did not match
Really like this product it goes on so smooth!!
I just can't bring myself to spend $30 on luxury brand make up. This works great and you can buy several colors to mix to make your perfect shade. And at under five dollars it's a bargain.  Lightweight. Love the Dewey versions of this. Nice glow without being greasy looking
After using a thicker product for years , changed to this as it doesn't cake up like some. I wear 102 and am happy with the choice. Not this product's fault but was shipped in bottle in poly mailer with no protection for the glass bottle. Opened to find a mess to clean up. The lid had worked itself loose. Still had about 3/4 left so cleaned kept it. The first bottle was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap. Will see how it goes but improvement in packaging would be appreciated. Love the stuff and will stay subscribed to see if packaging improves.
I have used this for years love it.
Easy to spread and color matches great!
This foundation definitely does not last all day on but it does give you that nice dewy look.
Amazing product!
This is my cheapest foundation when I'm too scared to pack my fenty on baecations lol. All that heat and beach water -Maybelline will do just fine.
light and soft on the skin
Goes on well with kabuki brush or sponge. The lightest shades are exactly what I have searched for, as I am very pale and other foundations turn orange y on my pale cool tone skin.
Good makeup
Love it. Good coverage.
Overall, this is a great alternative to more high end demi matte foundations. The price was incredible, especially considering how well the product spreads and how little you really need. It doesn't settle into pores, crack, or dissipate through wear. It is a good match for my pink undertones and covers rosacea and acne scares well. I like it a lot--I can see it becoming a summer staple because it is breathable and doesn't budge when I sweat. I can't say it's the most luxurious foundation I've ever tried, and I wish it was a little more thick coming out of the bottle (also, not easily to use in the sense that there is not pump--I just flip it and then dunk my fingers in the cap), but a great deal for the price. Impressed!
At 60+ years, I have been using this a long time and get complements on my skin all the time!
Went on smooth and was very easy to spread nit give a lot of coverage with having to put on a lot  I bought two shades I wasn't sure which shade would match I think both are beautiful though I love it will definitely buy again
Feels like I’m not wearing makeup and look like my natural skin! Great for mature skin; looks dewy, healthy skin look, easy to spread and lightweight!
dupe for high end foundations -- buildable coverage and no nreakouts
Finally something that does make my face look like chalk
Comparable to fenty foundation! I like this dewy foundation more than the matte one. Surprisingly it blended really well and my complexion is hard to find as a black women. I have a video showing an affordable makeup routine using this foundation check out my video on YouTube called “it’s Shanti”it’s a affordable makeup challenge!  I used the color 330! It’s buildable without being cakey 🔥🔥
Same as the store
This has been my go to for affordable, good quality foundation for a literal decade. I’m not a teenager anymore and so the matte look just isn’t working for me- so I switched to the dewy+smoky finish which I really do love. It works better on my skin now that I have a grown woman’s texture and smile lines etc. my only complaint and why I’m not giving 5 stars is because - if you have always worn say- shade #125 in the matte version, the shade #125 in the dewy+smooth will be at LEAST and entire shade or two darker! It’s extremely frustrating! I had no idea. So if you are switching from matter to the Dewy+ Smooth version, go a shade or two lighter than the shade# you’re used to buying.
Love this brand and the price. This product is very light but does its job. Love that it helps my makeup to stay in place.
I absolutely like this brand.I don’t need to apply much and it goes on smooth.
The dewiness almost looks greasy.  Too shiny by mid day
Wish it came with a pump but it doesnt so i have to pour it out the bottle to use
I’ve been using this brand for years with no complaints. My pores don’t clog and stay clear, this doesn’t cause me to break out. I have sensitive skin and this gives me no irritation. Great blend and shade, I keep two shades on hand for winter time and summer time, and I can even blend the two when it’s spring and fall. First jar I ordered shipped without protection and Amazon shipped a new one and wrapped the second in bubble wrap, no breaks or leaks! I’ve used both the matte and dewy and both are easy to apply, moisturize and don’t make me look cakey.
It works for the price and what it is. The shade is a little lighter than expected but once I added blush and bronzer, it evened out. Recommend
Love the sheerness of this and I will buy again!
I got 110 however I have yellow undertones and while a great foundation It was just too pink, so I gave it to my family member who does have pink undertones. I guess I need a buff fair color.
I'm exceptionally fair with pink undertones and almost every "fair" foundation looks yellow, tan, or orange on me. This is the only foundation I've found so far that actually matches my skin tone (in the shade Fair Porcelain). It goes on with really light, even coverage and the Dewy + Smooth type foundation looks perfect on my somewhat dry / otherwise normal skin. It gives enough coverage to dull my freckles but not completely cover them.
I love the sheerness of the makeup and it has enough moisturizer where it doesn’t break out my sensitive skin.
I tried the matte and feel in love! Matte is better than most high end foundations. Since I prefer dewy I tried this version. It just leaves you looking greasy, even with a person with dry skin. It again doesn’t wear long. I prefer the matte and poreless.
I have used this foundation since it’s release. Provides full coverage for my skin tone and texture. A very little goes a long way for me, I have combination skin type.
Had used this before so I knew what to except. Works very well for me.
This foundation is a great product that is not heavy on the skin.  The color I picked goes great with my skin.  It's a nice full coverage foundation.
Love the low price! And the fact that it goes on well,not too icky or anything,has a really nice dewy but not too dewy look!! Most definitely recommend!!!
Great foundation with high coverage.
Very lightweight great for summer
Light coverage
I don’t like this product, I got fair ivory and the foundation oxidizes to be orange by the end of the day. It was basically sliding off my face after a 5 hour shift despite me powdering and baking and it got to separate pretty weird. It seems very greasy. I used this same foundation in high school thinking I was just bad at makeup, but this just was not quality. I would save your money and invest in something higher quality, physicals formula butter believe it has been a staple for me but I decided to purchase a couple of these because the price was right.
Better than 100.00 brands.Sunscreen  good . Smooth. MoistGet the right color. . . Will love
I have been using this product for 6 years now. And it's flawless!
Good stuff!
Amazing foundation for dry skin and very good coverage
Oddly darker then before as I used this brand many times and this color is much darker then before.
This isn't a bad product, it's has an almost liquid texture which helps to evenly apply it. It's moisturizing and I definitely recommend it. I would triple check when you pick your color though, mine was a bit darker them I had originally thought. Good news is it's the perfect match for my sister!
This foundation is as it says dewy light easy to apply  it works with some products together but not ..
I’m extremely picky about what goes on my face because I have very sensitive skin!. This foundation is moderately priced, foundation does apply pretty smoothly and evenly, and can be built up if you need more coverage. It’s not very long lasting after about four hours it does start to crack. Also I would apply attention moisturizer with it for a little bit of help with the path of the color. The only issue I really have is there’s not a shade to exactly match my skin color but honestly I have not found a foundation yet to completely match my skin tone is so weird. But I would recommend Thang too similar color foundations if you are a light skin tone like me and mixing them together to get the perfect match!. If you ever want to ask me directly about anything please feel free to I am very open to healthy when it comes to make up or advice on anything pretty much you can find my Instagram itz.Leighanna.
For my skin, it's sticky, it's acne-prone, it's not for me
I have pretty dry skin and this looks super nice on my skin! You only really need a little bit and I apply it with a beauty sponge. I got porcelain.
So happy to catch the sale
Didn’t even bother with a refund seems to be an issue when something occurs. Tossed it, the product was a weird texture and wasn’t sure about the quality of it maybe it’s an old one or returned item previously or what ever but yah I’d buy ins tote next time
I had the matte version of this and the shade matches me perfectly, but the texture was really chalky. I got this one, hoping it would give me a healthier looking glow, but it didn't really make a difference.
I wanted to try a new foundation and chose this one based on the description of “smooth and dewy”. I was hoping I chose the right shade since I was basing my choice off of internet pictures, but went with natural beige. I couldn’t be more pleased! It is easy to apply, lightweight, but good coverage. It isn’t cakey. Color is perfect. A great everyday foundation that has spf!
it felt very oily/ greesey, just did not look pleasing to me did not spred evenly but was very soft in texture and in liqued form
Excellent coverage perfect match
Goes on smooth not cakey  Very good coverage
Takes just a small dab and goes on very smoothly with excellent coverage. I’ve tried several of the higher priced cosmetic counter brands and I much prefer this product over those.  This never looks “cakey” and feels so smooth.  Price wise it’s a steal!
I've tried many different foundations. We are talking super expensive foundations!!!.....and none have compared to this! I'm shook that such an inexpensive product leaves me with glowing skin! If you haven't tried this foundation you're missing out!
I love it.  I got a compliment from a woman at the Estee lauder counter.  I only gave it four stars because it doesn't last all day but even high end doesn't so it's great for the price.
Was too watery
Good coverage for price
I'm delighted that this foundation looks so good on my face. I tried the matte and looked awful. This "dewey" style looks so natural.
I've used the matte version beforeThis just feels wet and it does NOT have the same coverage. 1-2 layers of the matte foundation will entirely give you full coverage. But if you do 1-2 layers of this 'dewy' foundation, it DOES NOT WANT TO LAYER and just moves around. Yes, I have tried to let the initial layer dry, but even then, adding the new layer just takes off some of the previous layer/coverage.
Matches perfectly and stay all day without getting oily
Felt a little dry going on. Shade was a bit too lite but that's my bad. All in all a good deal.
This foundation is one of the best I’ve found. Unlike the Clinique foundation I used to use, this doesn’t dry out my face or show the dry spots on my cheeks. I use lots of moisturizer and cleanser as it is, so the fact that the Clinique still showed dry spots was disappointing since that cost me over $20! But this stuff is cheaper, and it could be used for more full coverage, but I like using it as light coverage to just even out my skin. It works pretty well with my sunscreen too! And it stays on all day unless I accidentally wipe it off with my napkin at the restaurant (oops!) but I use setting spray with it so that definitely helps it stay on. Plus it is more sheer so it matches my skin tone pretty well while also giving me a slight tint to look more tan :D
Overall I like it. I wish the color numbers matched.. I use 115 in Matte and 110 is to yellowy for me. I am going to try a lighter shade, the nice part it they are cheap enough to order a few and mix shades to get a true match
Love the look and feel of this foundation. Doesn’t make my skin look flakey. Doesn’t settle into fine line or wrinkles. Looks fantastic.
Moisture:  Very nice, not too much.  Nice finish.  Spreads very easily, no waste. Not too sheer, not cakey and doesn't look like i'm 'made up'.  Fragrance is overpowering.  This won't work for my sensitive skin.  Had to wash it off and by that time my eyes were glassy and running.  Sorry.  This is good foundation, otherwise.  You just might want to pass on it if you have rosacea, or any skin sensitivity.  Too bad.  Didn't know how to rate it.  If I didn't have the sensitive skin issue, I would rate it at 5, but with skin issues, I would give it a 3, just to make people aware of the fragrance issue  - it seemed overpowering to me.
Loved this.  Moisturizing and light.
Recommend it
This product is great for those days you want to look like you aren't wearing makeup! I usually need a full coverage foundation and it always feels like I am wearing a lot of makeup. This is sheer but buildable if you want more coverage. Perfect for non makeup days and for when you want to look your best.
I really like this foundation as I have oily and dry skin. It looks good on my face and smooth
Great coverage. Long lasting wear
I use this light shade as a all over concealer for my aging skin then use my shade of foundation. Works great for me sheer coverage
First of all… I’ve bought this once before but never  realized this:I used to wonder why my skin would look fine before leaving the house, and then by the end of the night I look several shades darker and… flaky-ish ¿ I thought my foundation was the wrong color before realizing that it’s the product.Left: warm sun 334 ( matte )Right: toffee 330 ( dewy )As you can see, after it dries and is slightly blended it’s a completely different color. I thought I was bugging but no , you just get what you pay for and this is my last time purchasing this.
This compared to more expensive foundations is the holy grail. It’s full coverage, very easy to apply, and the price is out of this world 10/10 recommend. Currently ditching my ik makiage, this is my new go to!
Easy application, smooth and bring a glow to my skin
This is a great, inexpensive foundation that use everyday.
Very light. Perfect match to my complexion. I’m pleasantly surprised!
I am so impressed with this foundation!  I just tried it on and while I was blending I realized that I hadn't used my moisturizer first.  I don't think I've ever put on foundation without a moisturizer, but I was curious and went ahead.  It is a GREAT foundation. My skin feels totally comfortable and very slightly dewy. I am 59 years old, my skin is dry and I have some fine lines. So I think this is amazing. There are no dry patches and the fine lines don't show at all. Without a moisturizer! It's a very clean look and feels light and fresh.  I have been looking for a foundation that is similar to Clinique "Extra Help Makeup" for years since they discontinued it.  Back then, in my 20's, my skin was pretty perfect and still, somehow that makeup made it look and feel better. This is the closest thing I have found to it. The Clinique color was Porcelain.I bought the Fair Ivory and it matches my pale skin with pink undertones.  Update: with moisturizer underneath it's even better, slightly more dewy with not the slightest greasy sensation.
I love how smooth this applies and coversI have pretty dry skin and usually I can see other foundations grab on to my dry skin but this seems to make everything disappear.I've bought a few more bottles. I just love this inexpensive but amazing Fondation
It's taken a lot of trial and error recently to find a foundation.  So many of them feel like you're wearing a waxy mask.  The last one by L'oreal was nearly impossible to wash off.  I wanted something full coverage that felt light and smooth.  Fit Me works beautifully.  It goes on smoothly with a makeup brush, I tapped it in with a Beauty Blender.  It blurred and blended well in concert with the matching concealer.  It moisturizes nicely without making your skin feel sticky.  No creasing or running throughout the day, even in the humidity. I didn't feel like I was wearing a shield on my skin which was the first plus.  The best part came in taking it off.  It washed off easily with mild face wash and water.  No residue in my pores, no breakouts in the morning.  I think I found a keeper.
Love how creamy ot was and the match was perfect
I have very pale, aging, acne prone and dry skin. I use curology to combat these problems. But I have found foundations to be a factor in my skin problems. I WAS using Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless, and I found it to be very drying and patchy on my skin. Seemed to cause excessive acne as well. But THIS foundation is so moisturizing for my skin. It does not go on patchy AT ALL. It goes on as a light coverage for me but I just apply another layer for more pigment. It looks so natural and easy on my skin. Get this if you have similar problems. Color seemed too orange when I saw it at first but it went on PERFECTLY like it was made for my skin tone. And that is a very hard thing for me to find usually since I’m so pale.
Very glad I tried this stuff, it really is moisturizing ... I have dry, mature skin and everything cracks on me - this doesn't, it doesn't look cakey either.  If it is a bit oily looking, a quick buff of powder, and your good to go.
I've been using this foundation for 7 years now and have just this week purchased an airbrush make-up system for myself.  I didn't want to spend a fortune on buying the foundation that's meant for an airbrush make-up machine so I used this Maybelline fit me foundation and mixed it with Mehron make-up mixing liquid to thin the foundation out like it needs to be for an airbrush. I only used maybe a tbsp of this foundation, a tablespoon or two of Mehron, and a half a tsp of elf make-up setting spray. I purchased some 2oz squeeze bottles and metal beads to mix my diy airbrush foundation and it works so amazingly. It's perfect because this Maybelline is water based and exact what I needed. I'm glad I can keep using my favorite foundation and don't have to start shade hunting all over again.This foundation alone was never very good at staying in place. Which was my only complaint, but mixing it and adding setting spray into the blend made it perfect. All day wear and no fading, smudging, or moving.
Not sure if it’s my luck with products but mine seemed to apply more on the watery side .like spread oil on water paint … I seen the color difference.. laughs to self clearly not my shade but perfect for blending . I tried working it with another product in hopes to thinking it up more . Even different brushes . To me I think this product ,my skin just wasn’t a match . It could be for you to find out an test for yourself in my opinion…just never know until you give it a whirl … but totally wish I had a video to show it applied .
This is such a good everyday foundation for normal to dry skin. Coverage is Medium. I'd say 118 (Light Beige) is pretty close to MAC NC20. This one leans yellow unlike shade 120 (Ivory) which was a little on the pink side to me. The only thing I don't care for is fragrance. Its not good for your skin and I prefer my skincare and makeup without it.
Goes on smooth, nice coverage. Not drying.  Absolutely love this. Definitely my favorite
I bought the color “porcelain” in both the dewy and matte fit me foundations. The dewy one is way darker than the matte one. What’s up with the inconsistency?
Buy it! This has been my go to makeup for years! usually pay $12.00 or more . This price is amazing!
Received it quick. Gotta say this is cheap but great foundation.. Good coverage without clogging pores.
Finally a foundation that didn't make me look orange and didn't dry my T zone area more than what it is. I've had a lot of trial and error with foundations especially with my dry skin and this worked for me.
I wasn’t trusting the reviews and I didn’t expect to like this as much as I did. This is now my new favorite, it has a great color, great coverage, and it is moisturizing. It’s exactly what I was looking for.
I had previously used the matte formula for this line and my eczema prone skin hated it. I've been using Almay for the past several years and while it gave me great coverage, my dry areas would be flaky by the end of my work day. I recently watched a YouTube review in favor of this dewy formula and decided to give it a try. It wears so nicely! Great coverage (buildable without being cakey) and spreads nicely with a beauty blender, and at the end of the day my driest spots still aren't flaky! It gives a great, natural glow without being shiny or "wet". Not only is this a great change for my skin, but also for my wallet! I'll be buying again for sure!
Wasn’t real impressed with this makeup..
The best product ever I love it
Love it
It’s kind of watery and I don’t like that it doesn’t have any safety seal on it, it looks used.
Everything!
It wasn’t the same color as. My skin tone it was more lighter than I thought it would be so I’m not going to use it as a foundation more like a concealer but other then that it’s great it’s soft and u can spread it easy
Great cover , nice and smooth look with out extra shine (oil). My skin gets really oil and I have a hard time getting my foundation to stay on and cover my acne and this product was a great support
I am in love with this foundation. It leaves A very even finish. Not heavy at all and covers without weight
I use Maybelline Fit Me all of the time and was shocked when I received my order to see the bottle was not filled to capacity, indicating someone had returned the item.  The information on the site says "New," but it was false advertising.
I have a hard time finding my color so this helps I posted 2 pictures of couple foundations that I purchased one with flash and one without
This product was super hard for me to find but I found it here on Amazon and I’m so happy this make up never clogs my pores and never rubs off on my clothing highly recommend
I've found that there are two different colors in the FIT Me collection that work for me. There is both  a "warm" and "cool" shade that when used together, is exactly what I need. I made the mistake of getting a FIT ME shade that was much too light for me (Porcelain) and so I ordered Nude Beige. I'll admit, I was devastated when I saw how orangey the Nude Beige was, but when I applied it, I couldn't believe how well it blended with my skin. I use the Porcelain on the parts of my face that I want highlighted and then the warm Nude Beige everywhere else. It actually works out well and it gives my skin a warm glow. Take into account how cool or warm your natural skin tone is before finding your perfect shade (or shades). Also, it is of VITAL importance to consider your skin type. Is your skin dry? Buy the dewy foundation. Is your skin naturally oily? Consider the matte. I made the mistake of ordering matte the first time and it is DRY. If you have issues with dry skin, do yourself a favor and get the Dewey + Smooth foundation.
I bought this foundation since it says it has a dewy finish. I use it all the time now. It glides on smooth over the skin, I do use moisturizer first. I like that its not thick and heavy but covers mu flaws well without drying my skin out.
I have tried many different foundations and this stuff is great.  I wish I would have found it a long time ago.  It’s my second time purchasing it and I hope they never discontinue it.  It provides perfect coverage and helps moisturize my skin as well.  It looks very natural when you put it on.  I can’t recommend this enough.  I was surprised by how inexpensive it is too because it is such a great foundation.
This is my first time trying any foundation except youniques mineral touch liquid foundation. And this is okay. It's really wet and cold in comparison and I had to use quite a bit more to get coverage, it didn't seem to blend as well. However it is significantly cheaper so I didn't expect it to be the same. I did like that it went on smooth and didn't feel cakey or heavy. But it did feel pretty oily and I was under the impression from their ad it was not supposed to. Feel oily, dewy and oily are 2 different things to me. I will try the matte version and see if that's more. Like the younique foundation I love... I just can't spend $40 on foundation anymore :(... But If I can't find a good replacement I will ugh..Overall for the money I spent I am happy... But just not what I expected because of the way they advertised it... And why is it so cold and slimy at first?? I understand it's a liquid but like I said I'm using a liquid and it's neither cold nor slimy... And yes I shook it.
I’ll probably have to mix two shades. I can’t seem to find the right shade for me. I love the makeup.
I wasn’t sure if this was my tone but it turns out it is and im really happy for it. Smells really good and does what it says
I really love the feeling and blend of this foundation. Its consistency is comparable to Il Makiage but I like this one better. Reasons why: the hydration it provides, it contains SPF (Il Makiage doesn't), and another nice thing is its $35 cheaper. I would like to try more shades. I found the shade that I had, had a lot of orange undertones and I would've preferred some blue undertones with my skin tone. With that said. Their color chart does need more variety but the value for cost is great.
Love the coverage and how light weight it is.  I get headaches from some foundations that have too much scent, this didn't cause problems at all for me.  I also feel like the price point is amazing for the product.  I have very dry skin, and I don't feel like it is a strong moisturizer but it also hasn't dried my skin out or given me acne like other ones, so I love it for the bit of moisture it does give.  Honestly this is my favorite foundation and so much cheaper than some of the others I've tried.
For my entire life, I have worn a foundation that is too dark for me in order to cover imperfections.  I finally went onto the Maybelline site and did a virtual try-on, which I recommend to everybody. I found my FitMe number, which I can use with any formulation.  It is so nice to extend it out to the edges of my face and have no telltale shade dropoff.As far as texture, I am VERY DRY. This foundation appeaers matte on me, which I actually like. I am also very sensitive and it does not trigger any sensitivity for me.
This foundation is as advertised...perfect match.  It's so light; you'll forget it's on, and a little goes a long way.
I had been purchasing high end foundations trying to find a match since Marc Jacobs discontinued my most beloved brand (Genius Gel).  And I returned them. Either too yellow or too orange or too smudgy.So I basically looked at the shade page on this item, and ordered (guessed) and it was perfect. It blends well, I can build up in necessary places (I'm looking at you, cheekbones).My only complaint is that it is very thin and spills easy, but at the price, I'm sold!
Best for the.price I have found. Stays on!!! Like forever. A must buy
The color was a good match. It is a very dewy, light weight, sheer foundation. Would recommend to someone who wants a more natural look.
Color was way to yellow (could have been user error I suppose). I still have to put serums on my face before I use it. It really needs more moisturizers in it.
I don’t dislike this product it’s as well on the skin and works as well as other foundations that I have used. However I bought the matte version first and that color worked beautifully. After searching I finally found the dewy version and that color was a little too orange.
I love how light weight the foundation is
The shade I purchased was a bit too dark but with that aside, this didn’t blow me away as far as finish, wearability, etc goes. I think it’s great for the price but would suggest L’Oréal infallible pro-glow if you’re looking for a drugstore foundation with a dewy finish. I always go back to that one!!!!

A decent product at an affordable price. Didn’t give me the dewey appearance or coverage I was hoping for but it is light, easy to apply and moisturizing.
This is the first time I tried this foundation and I like it very much.  It's definitely good for dry skin and "aging" skin.  Good product.
I love the way this feels on my skin it covers up my hyperpigmentation well it doesn't look like I have one makeup but you do need to use a setting powder or a setting spray or it will smear
Keeps my rosacea calm and has an SPF for protection.
Maybelline Fit Me Dewy & Smooth- Honestly, this is the best drugstore foundation I've ever tried. I usually like a matte foundation, but lately have found that my skin has been covering both ends of the combination spectrum, and the foundation on my more dry cheek and forehead areas looked patchy/flakey. I love how smoothly this applies, and it covers well without looking too "thick." The areas I need to keep matte,  I apply setting powder to. The areas that tend to patch up or look flakey, I just left alone. This combination has made my foundation look absolutely flawless. It's well worth the small amount of money vs more expensive high end foundation. Without a setting spray, this will likely transfer off throughout the day, but I found that a good setting spray will do the trick for that. (I use NYX's spray, it works well.)The only issue I have with this is that I was a "classic ivory" in another one of Maybelline's brand of foundation, but this was significantly darker than the other "classic ivory." If you can go somewhere to swatch, that'd be ideal.Overall for the price paid, an extremely good value.
I had seen several different influencers recommend this and thought I’d try it. It gives me good coverage for my age spots yet looks very natural. I’m very happy!
I ordered shade 110 porcelain after being shade matched on the maybelline website. The first thing I noticed was the very yellow undertone which did not flatter. I thought big deal, I just ordered the wrong foundation for my complexion. After finishing my makeup I looked like middle school barfed on me. It was ORANGE. The swatch on my hand oxidized down orange too. Upon putting a fresh swipe over the oxidized swipe I could see the beautiful fresh yellow contrasting with the ugly orange. This swipe also oxidized to orange. I can't imagine this working for any skin, but if you are very warm it may suit. Besides the awful orange, the formula was beautiful. I wanted it to work so bad. It smells like play doh, like all maybelline products seem to. I'm never impressed with this brand. They always fall short of my expectations. Oh well, returns are free. No harm no foul.
The photos are lighter than the foundation you receive. Foundation was darker then image
The only drugstore foundation that lives up to the hype for me. Not a “dupe” but good. Really pretty finish, lasts all day if you set it. I use this when I don’t want to use my high end foundations. It honestly looks great if ur doing a full face, and you can’t beat $5. I have tried two different colors and I noticed that the lighter shade I used,210 sandy beige, had a prettier finish than the more yellow shade 228 soft tan (pictured). I can’t find a perfect color match so i’ll keep buying 210. 210 is the same shade match as itcosmetics “medium tan” which are both a little light on me. Hope this helps!
So I typically buy expensive coverup brands but I was given this as a suggestion and thought why not for the price. I am genuinely shocked how great the coverage is. Smell is non exinsistant which is good because I hate smelling it, and the spread is awesome. Goes on smooth with a brush application.My only complaint is it can make my nose look a little oily and I need to pat midday.
Matched perfectly with my skin tone .
Ok so only certain foundations look good on my skin. My skin is dry and it can look really flakey and just overall bad after a long day.For a long time I  was using IT cosmetics CC cream but wanted to find something that was cheaper. I tried many drug store foundations and they all flopped before trying this one.All that being said I will not be returning to anything else because I love this product!!! It blends well and is light while giving full coverage. And you cant beat the price!!! ❤️❤️
Hardly any coverage and does not last all day
Look the coverage it gives.I have a natural look which is excellent.  Perfect match
Moist
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
great coverage but not heavy. i wear the same color in pressed powder and it's perfect.
This is my favorite foundation ever! You get such a great quality product at an amazing price. I normally wear foundation 3-4 times each week and this bottle ends up lasting me at lease 4 months. I would say the coverage is light to medium, so if you are just looking to even out your skin tone or cover up a few small spots, then this is the foundation for you. I have pretty pale skin and I have had a hard time finding a good foundation that didn't leave me looking orange and I finally found this one! It works really well with my skin tone and the color stays true and doesn't oxidize and get orangey like a lot of other foundations do. I have pretty dry skin and have found that this works best if you exfoliate a few times a week and moisturize first about 30 minutes before applying the foundation so it doesn't have any dry patches to stick to. I think that for the price, this is an amazing foundation. It applies smooth and the coverage lasts all day for me without having to reapply. I do recommend using a setting powder over top of the foundation if you like it a bit more matte because this foundation can tend to look a bit shiny if not.
Cap for foundation was opened, the product leaked everywhere!! Very disappointed.
I love this. It doesn't look dry and cracked on my face or like I'm wearing a mask. I use Tula for a smooth face before applying.
I like everything about this order thanks Amazon♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
The coverage was smooth and brought some glow to my face. Even though I got a light shade it was not a light enough shade for my face. Would need to see if they have an even lighter shade,
I don't really wear foundation, but when I need to, this one does ok
So smooth going on and great price
I was looking for a new dewy foundation during the pandemic so I ordered a lot of them to try. I like the glass look. I do not think this will give you that look without the proper skin care though. A dewy skincare routine is essential for that dewy look. I found this one and it was great to put over my skincare. It’s a great price too.  However, this is not the current foundation I use because I am focusing on the health of my skin and chose to go with something with an spf in it. Otherwise this would be my choice.
Very thin, runny. The shade is off a little compared to other brands with that name/number.
Love the smoothness , moisturizer and easy to applied perfect sink tone color no flaky hard look Amazing!
I bought this foundation because it was featured in Seventeen Magazine and Teen Vogue and everyone was trying it. The first time I tried it, the result wasn't what I expected, and my face looked really bad. But days later I changed the brush and gave this foundation a second chance and WOW, everything changed, it blended perfectly and my face looked really natural. This foundation has a really good coverage and doesn't make you look like you are wearing a lot of makeup. Just like everything, it has a minor problem, the color. I bought 315 Soft Honey because that's my tone on Covergirl, so I thought it would be the same. For my surprise, it wasn't. It's a little darker but with a little extra blend it can be fixed. If you are familiar with Maybelline products, I think you won't have problem with this. Also, it has like an orange tone, probably to give you a more tanned look. All this is in Soft Honey, I actually don't know how lighter or darker tones work. In conclusion, if you are a makeup beginner like me, I recommend this foundation.
This is one of the best foundations ever! I have loved it for years it makes your skin look so good.
love the price
I am 50 years old and my skin can tend to be dry.  I have a few wrinkles as would be expected and was really tired of foundation settling into the lines on my face and helping me look worse! Also i found that since my skin has aged foundation just seemed to be sitting on top of my skin and didn't have a blended appearance.  My daughter suggested that i try Dewy foundation for aging skin.  Wow, that really made a difference.  It had not occurred to me that i needed something different since my skin had started to really show the signs of aging.  I used MAC with mineral foundation for years and loved it, but it didn't look the same recently.  This foundation is exactly what it claims.  It's "dewy" and my skin seems to feel softer immediately.  the color blends flawlessly and I could not be happier.  I used it the first day with a primer and it was great.  I used it the second day without a primer and couldn't see any difference.  I consider that a bonus.  if your skin is aging and your younger foundation isn't quite the same i would definitely give this a try.
I bought the 2 versions of the Fit me foundation and honestly I like both of them. I  need to mix both of those tones to get mine and I like it. It's gotten a good price for how good it is. If you use a brush you can easily spread it and it smells good. I would highly recommend to use it if you are constantly exposed to the sun bc it really protects and moisturizes your skin. Looking forward to buying another one
I’ve been using Maybelline’s Matte & Poreless Foundation for years & decided to finally try Dewy + Smooth. Wish I’d done it sooner! I was put off by the amount of reviews preferring Matte + Poreless. General comments were that Dewy + Smooth looks greasy. I have normal skin & I actually like the Dewy look more.Many people have also pointed out that Dewy + Smooth runs darker than Matte + Poreless. I went to Walmart to test that out for myself & it’s true. If you’re switching like me, go for 1-2 shades lighter.In the pictures posted (one with flash, one without), the bottom splat is Dewy + Smooth in 115: Ivory & above it is Matte + Poreless in 125: Natural Beige. As you can see, I accidentally poured way too much. The opening is too wide in my opinion, or maybe I’m just that clumsy haha. Haven’t had the chance to take a selfie with this product yet. Will be updating this review!
I love that this foundation works for me AND my much lighter daughter!  The only other foundation I've found that does this is MAC and everyone knows how expensive they can be! I have two shades. One I use to conceal and highlight;the other offers perfect full coverage.
I am older and this stuff works. I use a moisturizer first. As good as dept. store products.
Very smooth finish and spreads really easy.
Ok, the picture was taken to show my new eyeshadow pallete by GenderFluid lol but to get this face coverage I had to do literally 3 layers. I used my fingers to put it on my skin cause there's no dropper or stick. Then I used a brush to apply it, then a brush again to add more. Then I went in with more and a beauty blender for the "final layer". I wasn't attempting like full coverage, I just wanted to kind of hide or blurr some discoloration I have around my nose and I had a little acne along my jaw line. For a VERY light, almost like tinted moisturizer kind of coverage, this is perfect.
it’s so nice and beautiful coverage. blends amazing but the oxidation is horrible :(
Might work if you have really dry skin. Just made me look like a greasy mess.
Good
I have been using a sealer and powder powder on my face for about 12 years because I never liked how liquid foundations didn't blend easy or would look really really thick and this has my mind blown. I used a makeup brush and this, it took me maybe 3 minutes to do and it covers so nice and leaves a nice Dewy look and lasts all day. No more powdered or concealers needed!! I'm so glad I finally bought it to try it out.
Too oily for my face Idk why but my face is dry but it spreads so much oil on my face and doesn't feel like its a dewy foundation rather I feel like I put some heavier full coverage foundation.
This particular seller is getting reviewed not the product which is great but bottle didn't have seal and looked dirty used
It’s perfectly matches my skin tone, but it slightly oily for me. I like dewy look but it’s too much for me. I have order matte kind instead of dewy. Let’s see how it works. Perfect for brown skin
I love this foundation because it's light weight, matches me perfect, doesn't make me break out. I love tgat its affordable. The great thing I also like is that it wears off evenly through out the day. It lasts about 6 hours and then you'll need to put more on if you're going out again. This is good to even out sking tone. This is not for those who are looking full coverage. The matte it better for that. This is low maintenance. If someone rubs you you dont have to worry about it being suoer noticeable.
They're her color she likes. The price. Was paying 9.00 local. Not anymore. Thank you. Deputydog 🐕‍🦺.
This is a reorder. Covers well without being too thick, wide choice of shades, looks good.
I bought this for my teenage Neice who says she likes how smooth it goes on and last all day. Her skin tone matches the shade she chose.
this foundation is pretty good considering it's price. however, while putting on face it is a little bit oil and hard to be spread. too dark with time goes on and will shade too soon
I love the light feeling but good coverage of this. Works great with my dry and sensitive skin!
This foundation is the best economic foundation in the market according to me.It’s light yet gives coverage.
I love the coverage but I must it another because it can be orange
I have no complaints. Matched my complexion perfectly. Goes on smooth & light with buildable coverage. It worked great in Northeast Cold & Florida Heat lol. It is was perfect for me.
This is a must to have at your makeup bag I really like the fit me foundation it won’t disappoint. It’s super inexpensive and super affordable and it leaves a light sheer feel to face.I use the ivory 115 shade.
Does have the thickness that I’m used too. Too runny. Spreads easily but you have to apply more due to the sheerness.
I had to return bc I got the wrong color but I still tried the formula to make sure it was what I wanted. I have dry skin and can't usually use foundation without looking like a powder donut (i dont use powder) This stuff however was very smooth and blendable and made my skin look soft and even! I loved it and will be buying myself a lighter shade.
A bit dark but I have been using it & for the price, it's ok. It does provide good coverage & spreads well.
This foundation offers a dewy feel and gives super overall coverage!
It was good, made my face sting a little, kind of weird
Good product for older skin I'm 44 this seems to smooth on nice I don't use primer or any of that stuff. You'll need you to set this with a light powder,  or  it will slide all over your face but it looks natural, covers everything. I'm used to just buying the lightest shade of makeup they have, any brand.  Not in this one it was way too light, go darker than you think you need to go . be sure you know your undertones. lots of color choices here, it took me awhile to get it right but once I did I love it.
The coverage on this is amazing! It covers enough to cover up all up my red spots and ance but my freckles can still shine through! I'm sure you could layer it on a little thicker to cover up the freckles if you wanted. It's very lightweight on the face but stays put. I've worn it all day and didn't have any problems with it fading or sweating off. Also, I have combination skin, my tzone is oily but the rest of my face is a little dry and this works perfectly for that!I will definitely be buying this again and again!
This spreads well but it is very sheer and the consistency is thin. Poors out of the bottle almost like water. But for the money it’s pretty much what I’d expect.
I ordered ivory and although it has the right number on it, it is a couple shades darker.
It was runny and you have to apply multiple times before it looks like you have any makeup on
I have always used Maybelline's mascara and recently starting using their foundation , and wow where have I been . It works fantastic and I will never stray from Maybelline .
Worth It!  Really light, clean, smooth coverage.  I apply with fingertips. So easy!  Nobody knows I’m wearing makeup.  Sweet.Almost invisible but no redness or minor blemishes can be seen.Really lovely.  I have used this for 3 years off and on.  Always my go to base.  Especially when traveling.  Easy to buy pretty much anywhere unlike several of my favorite expensive brands.
Been using this for years. This really is dewy, good medium buildable coverage, lasts long, looks natural as long as you make sure to blend it in. I use a very dense brush to blend after I dot directly on my face. I do use it with Maybelline primer and a bit of setting powder. 110 is perfect color, so pretty, just a little pinkish. You can't beat the price. This is every bit as good as expensive high-end foundation in my opinion.
This foundation was really beautiful on my skin. It provides medium coverage and didn’t settle in my 54 year old lines. The finish was very skin like. Initially I was very happy even though I wasn’t thrilled the formula having parabens in it. I could have overlooked that. My skin is normal, skewing towards sensitive. After wearing this for two days my face started erupting in red mounds. Only one ever filled with a liquify white head. It’s now been three days since discontinuing wear and I’m still experiencing the occasional mound. I’m not someone who suffers breakouts, nothing had changed but this foundation. Even though I loved the look of this foundation. I cannot recommend. I also realize mine is not the only review stating this issue.
I got the classic ivory since I’m a little more fair skin and it was so yellow!! Complete waste.
Initially, I tried the Maybelline Fit Me matte & poreless, but it was too drying for my skin, and would look flaky after applied.My skin tends to be drier and sensitive, so I just wanted some light, hydrating coverage.  It’s lightweight, easy to spread, and gives my skin a more youthful dewy glow.  Pictured, I first washed my face with Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser, used Neutrogena hydro boost water gel as a face moisturizer, then applied this Maybelline Fit Me dewy + smooth in ivory #115.  I have eye/eyebrow makeup on, but no other makeup on my skin.  I’m glad I found this product!
I don’t like the oily ness of it and it makes me feel like I have it caked on my face def not good to wear in the summer
Very good product considering its price. I finally found a shade that matches my skin tone and I will deff be repurchasing. Applies amazingly with a beauty blender or even a brush.
Loved the price on Amazon and thought this would be perfect for my daughter's normal/dry skin.  While the foundation was moisturizing and went on great, unfortunately the color was too orange and we had to return it.  Will try again in a lighter, more neutral shade.
It does ok , it’s worth what you are paying for it
Not a bad foundation for the price. I have dry skin and this stuff really helped stopped that cake-y look many foundations give me. It. Is. Dewey. If you're not wanting that "glow" then use their Matte version.I am ungodly pale and the 110 matches my skin nicely. I would suggest trying out different primers before applying this foundation. I prefer silicone based primers, but they didn't look right under this foundation. So when I use this stuff, I opt for Ulta's hydro prime. Much better pairing.Coverage! This foundations beings a good medium coverage that could easily be built up to full with a second go around with a beauty blender.Cons: after an hour or so, the foundation starts to make my pores more noticeable. But a quick blot with some oil absorbing sheets and the problem is fixed. Not a bad trade off for a high performing yet inexpensive product.
I only gave it four star because it’s not the best match for me. I wanted this dewy because I have dry skin versus the matte poreless coconut. But turns out I like the other one better as far as matching. This one gives a lot of yellow undertone, so does the mate poreless but a lot less. I just use the poreless coconut and make sure to moisturize well. I also use a shimmer prime for the dewy look
I'm biracial (black and white) and this is the closest commercial product I can find to my skin tone. I was excited to see it in the store for the first time because it has a yellowish/greenish tint instead of a pinkish tint. My issue with brown makeup is most companies make it very pink so it doesn't match my natural color.I only apply once in the morning, but I also use a matte finishing spray so that likely helps. I got a compliment on how good this makeup looks from one of my African American colleagues who said she also has trouble finding foundation that matches her skin because it's usually too pink. I told her to try this. Cosmetic companies--pay attention! Ditch the heavy pink-tinted foundations!Glad to have found this on Amazon because it's less expensive to buy here than the store.
Great for dry skin. Light / Medium coverage
Good thing I have some light foundation to mix with this but light ivory is more like light tan. Other than that formula is good
I like this foundation very much.  It has nice build able coverage, stays put and just "feels" good.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have a pump to dispense.  I feel a pump dispenser keeps your product fresher, longer - and no waste.
Has an orange tint to it. I mixed it with my other foundation and it looks great.
This product gives great coverage,  smooth and does not cake. Worth the price!
I bought this product at first time and it’s good one . I’m glad that I purchased this items.
Super moisturizing and brightening foundation. These come in many different shades, something which I consider crucial for a beauty product. I highly recommend this product for those who have dry, eczema and/or acne prone skin! Most makeup products tend to irritate my skin, however this did wonders and covered up nearly all my patches without breaking me out or burning
Bottle was not sealed (loose top) so some some foundation spilled out. They color is not for me it has too much pink in it. I did try it to see if I would like the formula and I would purchase it the right color. If you like a dewy finish, then this is for you!
This is my winter foundation and I love it the only problem is that it isn't completely full coverage mostly just medium to almost full coverage but other than that it's amazing
I purchased the Maybelline Fit Me Dewy + Smooth Foundation in shade Mocha 360.  It arrived earlier than the delivered by date and was in great condition.  No spillage, cracks, or broken seals.  Yes, the dewy foundation is runnier in terms of consistency than the matte version, but that's just how Maybelline made the formula.  So, do use a light hand when pouring this product out.Also, you the dewy foundation will have to be built up depending on what type of coverage you like.  In my opinion, this product had a strong reddish-orange undertone when it was first applied.  However, as it dried and set the undertone wasn't as strong.  I put on one coat and didn't need to reapply at all.  I would recommend the dewy formula other people with dry skin because it did help to keep my skin feeling hydrated unlike when I use matte foundations.Will definitely be purchasing this product again.
I used many foundations in over 5 years of my life because I sweat more quickly in cool weather too. I expected the foundation should be smooth and blend quickly and it is. This review may help for wheatish and dry skin toned.  it stays long even during humid. This foundation makes you appear natural and compound greatly well with the skin. I recommend this product also for people one who sweat more even in ordinary weather, so this is the good product you can try .. it won't create mess even you sweat :)
My first time trying Fit me. Good coverage. Held up all day. Color was not a perfect match,but that's because I bought online vs being able to open up and look in-store. Overall happy for spending the 5$.
It's a good foundation. I like the texture. I've yet to find a liquid foundation that has longevity,  so I couldn't give it 5 stars in that category. But everyone's body is different & products react differently  for everyone, so I suggest everyone just don't take what I say for you also, try it out for yourself. It might be perfect for you. It's nice & creamy & smooth. Good value for the money.
It’s great product but it wasn’t factory wrapped.it was only half full, IF THAT! although it was wrapped in bubble wrap for shipping purposes.I won’t be using it bc of it being opened already
I have larger pores, uneven skin tone & several flaws that I aim to hide when I wear my makeup. Maybelline New York Fit Me Dewy + Smooth Foundation is perfect for me. The foundation blends flawlessly and it's not a heavy thick formula. Instead it offers a light weight, supple & smooth finish. Amazing job at covering my imperfections. The shade selection is quite large as well so there are many color options to choose from.I assure you that a little goes a long way. This is my new favorite foundation hands down!
This works just as well as my $45+ Liquid foundations. I’ve tried clinique, born this way, Marc Jacob’s, urban decay, etc and I’m definitely not going back. I have dry skin, my face doesn’t soak it all in and leave a cakey mess on my face after a few hrs. I love it. It has good, buildable coverage and doesn’t feel heavy. I will be buying more for sure.
Love the medium coverage.  Blends well and lasts.  Doesn't settle into lines.  I use it daily and will buy it again.
I just applied the foundation for the first time so i cant say how the longevity of the foundation is, but i have eczema, so my skin gets dry fast i like that my skin feel hydrated; And moreover, I have a hard time finding shades for women of color with the right tones to match my skin, i love this shade i use concealer to highlight but its so natural i really didnt need to use it. My shade i tried is 330 TOFFEE for the FIT ME DEWY AND SMOOTH. Great quality once you have the right shade.
This product is not only a great price, but it also spreads easily and holds all day. A small amount goes a long ways and it doesn't feel heavy on my skin.
I love this drug store product and the price makes it even better. I have used so many different foundations high end to drug store and this is by far my favorite no creases or cake face which is the best and getting it shipped to my house instead of searching through racks and paying more money this is the best
It works well for every day use.
My first time trying this formula and I give it a thumbs up! I haven't worn foundation much recently because I'm 60 and older skin looks scary with too much makeup.  But this is not as thick as other foundations that I've used in the past. The color blends in evenly and the feeling is like you're not wearing foundation is all. It evens the skin tone very nicely yet still looks light and natural.
I had been spending way more on foundation until I found this...one of my holy grail products...in 2018. I've been using it ever since. My face is always chronically dry, but this foundation helps tremendously. I pair it with ELF hydrating primer. The coverage is great and the price is even better.
Need a good sticky primer or else it moves a lot. Not easy to get an even finish. Leaves skin looking and feeling greasy. I really like the super stay and decided to give this one a try. Good price and may work for someone else just not for me.
I like my item but the delivered not good
Great for the price
This won’t be your typical full coverage foundation, but I’d say with a little buildup you can get it to a medium coverage. Makes your skin look fresh, it has a nice natural finish, not too dewy, which I like. The price was great! Definitely will purchase again
Very natural
Easy to use.  Spreads easily.  Good coverage
I love this product
Good value good color
I love this foundation. I get it every few months. My last couple bottles that I ordered unfortunately got broken by the shipping personnel though, but that is not the seller's fault.
Nice product, nice coverage and not cakey at all
This is my go to for lazy make-up daily wear. I hate wearing the stuff. This is my favorite for full coverage and to slap on and go.
Without masks, visor and sunglasses I tan easily and use natural beige or even a more tan color like medium beige/tan in the summer. Those colors are too yellow and dark for my untaned  skin right now and the switch to Nude Beige works very well at the moment. Whenever masks will come off, the darker colors can be easily mixed with the lighter ones.
This is my first time ever buying and trying makeup and the 355 coconut fits my skin perfectly. Maybe a little too perfect actually. It blends well and it had a nice smooth glow to the skin. My skin is oily and dry and it actually looks good even after I bake which tones down that dewey look a little. The bottle is tiny though:(  I will try matte one next time but I think its worth the try.
So I am a foundation lover. I often purchase and try new ones searching for the perfect one. This one isn’t bad. It perfect for a light coverage foundation. It evens skin tone but still allows imperfections to show through making it look natural. It is one of the more dewy foundations I have tried but as someone with extremely dry skin it’s defiantly not as dewy as I’d hoped. It does cling to any of my dry spots but it has a more satin finish. It will move so I have to set it with powder. It reminds me of L’Oréal fresh wear.
Great product
What a mess! So disappointed two of them were broken
I have used this product in alteration with the matte one for years. It never fails. Recently I'd been using a different brand that I also love, but living in California for the recent months has been very hard on my skin. I've been extremely dry and my foundation has been looking terrible. I decided to go back to this one and it's been a great decision so far. I love the dewy look and it's been helping my dry skin. I'm very pleased
I got shade #110 which is Porcelain so should be super light, right? It goes on an orangey tan color. And it's not like I can order a lighter shade! I also thought this was supposed to be a full coverage product but it's super sheer. It doesn't apply smoothly to my face either. I honestly though this would be the solution to my foundation woes but it's not going on my dry skin any better than all the other foundations I've tried. And "dewy"? More like greasy. And "smooth"? It probably goes on most people's skin smooth but on mine it just breaks apart and looks like peely skin. Also, maybe I got a bad bottle but it feels a little gritty...ewww. I tried to take a pic for you but my phone wouldn't focus closely enough to show you what I'm talking about.
I love Maybelline fit me foundations and I've always used 102 in the matte variety even though I have dry skin because I've never been able to find fair porcelain in the dry skin kind. I was so excited to see this especially because it has spf in it! It came in one day and the shade is perfect, however the bottle was missing a chunk of glass which fell out of the bubble wrap it was in and nearly cut me. So that was definitely disappointing. But I would probably buy again just because this is the exact shade in the exact formula I've been looking for
It looks so natural and goes on smooth. Love it. Will buy again.
this is a really great product.  i got a small sample and tried it out.  it went on very smoothly and had a very natural finish.  it's is also very light in texture and therefore not noticeable once on the skin.  it doesn't mask your actual skin and it does give nice enough coverage (as long as you don't have a need for a full-on mask).i think this product comes in 2 types.  because the sample i got was for a particular shade and that shade really fit me well, i got the same type and shade when i made a purchase.  the "dewy smooth" is nice enough but those w combination skin should be aware that it does leave a truly "dewy" finish, i.e. a bit of shine.  if you like a really natural, unfinished look, this is great.i have tried many brand names that cost 8-10 times the price i paid (on amazon), and this product would stand up favorably against all of them.
I love this foundation.  My skin is just starting to get a bit dry. I have gotten many compliments about my "glowing" skin since wearing this Apply lightly gir a natural glow or it can appear heavy.
Love this drug store foundation and can’t find a better price than here on Amaazon!
Great price! Great product!!
I love this foundation. I have dark spots and a skin disorder that causes hyper pigmentation on my cheek and neck and without concealer this covered my problem areas without any problems. It also give you a dewy glow and does not dry out my already dry skin. Will be getting this again.
I will order this foundation again, however, I should have ordered a shade lighter for my skin (not the company's fault by any means, just realized my skin is more fair than the shade I ordered which I didn't know until I wore it once).  I would recommend it, but would recommend if you think you know your skin tone, or base it on the color of other foundations you've used, you might want to go a shade lighter for this brand.
Moisturizing, easy to spread. You can look great using a little or a lot. I use a lighter color in winter and this next color darker in summer so my face and my neck match!! You can wear it sheer or use more for more coverage. Good for sensitive skin.
If you need a sheer water infused coverage to compliment your skin THIS IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET!  I really work hard on my skin and it shows - I dont do fillers or botox and I constantly get complimented on my skin as "Glowing" when I wear this foundation.  You can achieve Glass Skin with this product. I love it and own it in four shades
I have so many allergies & I think I found something I can use.
This is my go to foundation. It’s easier to spread with a kabuki brush then I blend it in with a sponge. it’s inexpensive, for me it’s full coverage and though my skin is oily, the matte never works for me though.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist and a make up artist. I worked for MAC for 3 years, and I have literally tried everything from Make Up Forever to Estee Lauder to Lancôme. This is by far my most favorite EVER among high end and drugstore brands.This foundation is perfect for my combination skin. Now that I've hit my late 20's my skin has changed drastically. Before it was oily and acne prone, now it's dry AND still acne prone to breakouts, especially with most high coverage liquid foundations. It was impossible to find the balance between coverage, moisturizing and not breaking out. This foundation has done it for me. It's a buildable coverage that goes on like silk and matches my skin perfectly. It covers all imperfections, including remaining acne blemishes. I combine it with yellow under-eye concealer (more for brightening than coverage since this does great on its own), and set it with Sephora MicroSmooth Mineral Powder. I end up with a flawless, dewy complexion and NO breakouts! At this price, you can do no wrong but to try it for yourself!
the "fit me" collection is probably one of, if not, THE best foundation you can buy from a drug store brand! I have kind of temperamental skin, it will be super oily one day and then super dry the next. so, on my dry days my face tends to be pretty dry even after my thorough moisturizing routing /: so when using the matte + poreless foundation it would just enhance pores and textures (I am a man too so I had even more texture than my lady counterparts) and I just thought that was just how makeup was gonna look on me for the dry days... and then I found out how revitalizing dewy foundation is and I am ecstatic! long lasting, moisturizing and just a steal of less than $10! get it!
I’m 43. Used with a blurring primer first and next time wore with a moisturizer. Both times it didn’t look dewey. It felt dry on my face, looked chalky in some areas and I felt like it clearly showed my pores. My skin is very dry and aging, I thought this would be a good foundation but it’s just not for my skin type.  Maybe it will compliment those with a dewey skin type anyway, but I have a lot of pores on my face and this just amplified them. Im not out much money, and when I was a little younger this brand was great, but even with a primer or moisturizer it didn’t look good. Next time I may use the tarte Amazonian clay powder to set it as it usually can soften the skin a bit, and I also blame myself too thinking I can take dry skin with tons of pores and make it look Dewey somehow. Those miracles don’t happen lol
This foundation goes on smoothly and easily. Sheer coversge that will not cake and does not emphasize lines. Leaves face moisturized and glowing. Tried many. This my favorite. Delivery swift and price the best.
So glad to find the lightest shade , fair porcelain , here on Amazon . It's about a shade darker than fair porcelain in the matte and poreless version but still light enough for my super fair complection. I have normal to dry skin and the dewy and smooth worked wonderful.  It gave my skin a nice dewy look but not greasy.  I will say, if you have oily skin this might not work as well.  I'm 46 and this didn't accentuate my fine lines.  I'd say it has a medium coverage.  I applied this with my fingers  or a beauty blender and both methods worked fine.  It's a thin liquidity foundation and doesn't feel heavy on the skin. This is one of the best foundations I've ever tried .  I paid $5.99.  If you have pale ,maturing, normal to dry skin then you might really like this. Hope this review helps.
I love this product so much! Makes your skin look beautiful!
I've tried several expensive products. I've been color matched at the cosmetic counter and liked the product in the store , only to get home and find the color is off, that its too thick, settles in my fine lines. This product , I ordered out of desperation. I ran out of my good stuff . Feels light on my skin. Just enough coverage but doesnt look like I am wearing foundation. The dewey adds a nice , natural glow. I can't believe how affordable my new go- to is. Try it !
Like the color and they way it is full coverage.  Easy to put on
I never tried the dewy and smooth one and I absolutely loved it. I like the way it’s looks and the way it goes on. I actually use a lot less that the matte and pore-less one so this one is going to last longer. I love this foundation! If you have mixed skin when sometimes it’s oily and sometimes it’s dry this is perfect for you.
Looks ok
It does spread pretty good and cover your face good I've ordered this like months ago and still have tons of it to use it's like I never opened it. A little goes a long way
I have used Christian Dior or Estee Launder. This actually spreads better and doesn’t break me out!
This foundation has a very pretty finish but I can't find a perfect shade for my light-medium olive skintone. I bought this one for my summer shade and it's very peachy, kind of orange.. I would not recommend this finish for anybody who has scarring or blemishes. It was light to medium coverage at best for me and it didn't build well with brushes or sponges. However, it has a very natural look and doesn't smell bad or feel heavy on the skin.
My new favorite foundation. I have been using a foundation that caused the skin on my nose to peel and crack while at the same time rubbing off within just a few hours revealing the redness of my nose. Basically, it was disgusting. Before trying this foundation I thought the cracking of my skin was just because it is extremely dry but when I put this foundation on i realized that it stayed put on my nose all day and I no longer have a peeling nose. When you put this foundation on, it feels like there is nothing on your face and it is very buildable. The only problem I have with this foundation is that my eyeliner wears off way quicker and smudges on my undereye but that can be fixed with a little powder which I don't do because of my dry skin. Love it.
What steered me to this product was not only the selection of colors, but the price.  I thought I would be 'settling' for a bad product, but low and behold, it spreads great, and last all day.  I am always changing my color because of the difference between spring, summer, and winter.  Now, I have found that many retailers sell this line, so I don't have to get it in one place.
I am on my 3rd bottle of this and absolutely love it. This seller sent the product as described, with no issues. I intially tried this foundation as an alternative to the maybelline fit matte, pore-minimizing foundation. There is definitely a color difference between the two with the matte one being lighter than this one is. I was hesitant to try this product because I have combination skin and I did not want oil to become prominant in all of the wrong places. Although this foundation says "dewy", I find that it goes on smooth and resembles a more natural look with good coverage (I still need concealer, but minimal). The sunscreen is definitely a plus! For me, I have a 8 hour day at school and the foundation holds strong without my face looking oily (as long as I use powder on top of it).
A little dark as I'm usually pretty good at shade matching. Light to medium coverage but it is buildable.
My skin is extraordinarily weird: I get really oily yet my skin is still flaky and dehydrated. Almost everything I've tried has stuck to dry patches on my skin making my skin look very bad. However, I tried this once it came and it basically didn't stick to any dry patches and left my skin with a nice, smooth finish. Overall, I like this product a lot! Quick tip: even if you have dry/dehydrated skin you might want to put a bit of setting powder on your T-zone just because this product is quite dewy.

I really love this! My skin is combination/dry and it works for me!
This is my holy grail truly ?
I've always been a fan of maybelline fit me, it's not a your typical drug store foundation. It's not thick, nor too runny. And it doesn't look caked on when applied to your skin. It's smooth and the smell isn't bad at all, it makes me skin look so finished EVEN with my freckles. See, I could never wear foundation because of my freckles. They just didn't collide well together when you have faded freckles poking thru foundation. But maybellines fit me foundation, fits me! My freckles are still clearly visible, yet my skin looks flawless. What more could I ask for? And at this price? I love it! Thank you Amazon, I don't even need to go to the drug store anymore! Btw packaging was perfect and kept it safe from cracks or holes. Recommended 100%! I order shade 115 in ivory for my light skin. I usually get 112, but they ran out so I settled with this and it fit just as well!
So awesome, in general but especially at this cheap price point. I wasn't even expecting much, I just looked up a few reviews and threw this in my cart to get to $35. Most foundation brands, low and high end, don't carry shades light enough for me. That was my first pleasant surprise, that the shade was actually a good match. It has pretty good medium coverage and a really nice finish, and doesn't do what so many more expensive foundations have done, which is create dry patches on my skin. The only minor flaw is that even on my dry skin, after a few hours, the glowy finish can start looking a bit oily, which is why I don't think this would be a good foundation for oily skin types. I have skin that's a bit acne prone too, and after using this for two months I can confidently say it hasn't caused any breakouts either.
I had an issue with my concealer being patchy, and I thought replacing my 2 year old foundation might fix the problem, but it didn't.  The foundation is nice but still doesn't blend well with my concealer.  Don't know if its the foundation or the concealer causing the problem but I would definitely buy!  Make sure its the right shade though, I bought a bit too dark for me.
I used to purchase Avon Foundation in Chestnut.  They discontinued it recently.  I searched high and low for the perfect foundation for my brown skin.  Voila!!!  I came across this.  I have it it warm coconut which blends perfectly with my skin.  It's very radiant and long lasting.  People compliment me all all the time on my natural looking foundation.  This is my new favorite "go-to" foundation and it's very inexpensive.  I strongly recommend this brand.  It goes on smooth and very evenly.
I'm usually into high-end foundations ( Becca, Mac, Tarte) and I'd recently bought one that was a shade too dark so I thought instead of dropping another $40 on a second foundation to lighten it out why not buy a drugstore brand? I've heard good things about this foundation and it's considered a dupe for Mac's studio fix liquid foundation so I went ahead and purchased off here. WHERE HAS THIS BEEN LL MY LIFE??? I have the worst case of oily skin and have tried baking, mattifying primers, setting sprays, YOU NAME IT. I decided to try it alone and my foundation has never looked so fresh and smooth for so long. I work about 8-9 hours a day and this has lasted me the entire day without me looking like I just did the most intense HIIT workout. And for the price buying this would be a no-brainer.
I’m torn on if I like this foundation. It works ok but spreads really strange. Kinda patchy. But it’s good coverage. Less dewy than I expected but you obviously get what you pay for which is great. For anyone on a budget.

Tool dark.
I loved this and it was my favorite for months however after my kid sister insisted I switch I did. And I really wish I hadn’t thrown it out because it was a good foundation so I’m pissed at her for that. That being said the dewy works for if you have dry skin to illuminate it. And distract from the patches.
So the positives first, the color matches my skin wonderfully and it is very moisturizing. Now the negatives, it leaves your skin feeling sticky, like you can feel the make up on your skin all day. And the smell, way too perfume for me. Product is a little too sheer. More like a tinted moisturizer. All in all for the price I will keep it and when my skin is super dry probably use it.
I have never found a foundation that actually worked, looked natural, and didn't break me out. I have mature skin so it is a difficult thing to find one that moisturizes but doesn't cause blemishes.This is it. It is amazing. I absolutely positively and highly recommend this.
The product got here before the estimated arrival and it was in perfect condition and everything. It obviously matches my skin tone and it is easy to put on like look flawless.... for a while.... I have oily skin and I don't like checking all the time if I am getting shinny anywhere on my face. I do have to powder a lot more often than I usually do, but I can not stop using it. It is a really good foundation and the finish is just amazing. I would rather keep blotting my face than keep reapplying foundation over and over again. I would buy this again and I would support other people to try this product as well. If you have oily skin you just have to be more causious, but to be honest I mainly get oily around my nose and my T zone is perfectly fine for a while.
I started wearing foundation for dance recitals. They were always too dark for my ginger skin. I didn’t look like me. So as I grew up, I decided to never wear it until there were options for people with skin as fair as mine. It took decades, but that has finally occurred. This looks great on my skin and goes on smoothly. It doesn’t oxidize on me. I may now commence with the happiest of dances.
Excellent and good
I really like the foundation! My skin is really dry, and is easy to show spot on my skin, but this product is not showing the dry spots. They are not that good to cover thing up, but they can apply many time in my skin.
Arrived with a broken top, other than that product is great
Love this makeup. Sits well, doesn’t cake. Looks natural and moisturizing.
Love this! I am just starting out in the makeup world after turning 35. I have little to no background or education in picking or applying makeup except for what I see on YouTube. I tried another foundation product before this one, and I hated it- it was very greasy and gave very little coverage. This foundation is amazing! It is light, but does give full coverage. Very easy to spread with fingers or makeup sponge as well. Lasts ALL day, and does not cake up or flake off.
In general, I'm a fan of the Fit Me line-- there are 2 formulas, a ton of colors to choose from, the price is reasonable, and I can buy it at the grocery store. I have dry/combination skin, so I picked this up as an alternative to the matte formula which can sometimes accentuate my dry patches. Unfortunately, I still far prefer the matte formula to this. I found this difficult to blend, even with a beauty blender. I bought the same shade as I would in the matte, but upon application it oxidized to a weird orange-y tone in some places of my face. It didn't settle into my skin throughout the day and looked/felt like it was just sitting on top of my face. I wasn't happy with the coverage either and didn't find this to be very buildable and gets cakey looking if you add more. I haven't thrown this away yet, and occassionally come back to it, hoping for better results every time I give it another chance, but end up disliking it every time I wear it.
I've been having trouble finding a foundation that will work with how dry my skin is so I decided to give this one a shot. First of all, this foundation smells really good! The scent isn't very strong though; you won't smell it while wearing it. I'm pretty pale and have pink undertones, so I ordered shade 115, per the recommendations of the shade guide on Maybelline's website, and it's perfect. I used my Fenty Beauty sponge to apply and it went only evenly, wasn't cakey, and made my skin look dewy but not too much. It also hid the dry patches I have and didn't flake.However, this foundation is a bit runny and you have to pour it out, so be careful!But as of right now I would definitely purchase this again!
Better coverage than other products. moisturizes well. Needs to set on face and dry before touching.
Light weight and easy to spread. Very watery so be careful applying it your brush/sponge and face. It's sheerness brings out a natural shine for the foundation.  If you want a more non-matte look this is the way to go.
This foundation gives very good coverage and goes on feeling very smooth. It was darker than I hoped (that's more Maybelline's fault for not making lighter shades of this foundation for pink skin tones....) but it thankfully doesn't oxidize. I like that it's not matte and I don't necessarily need to put on highlighter to look like a normal face. It does get a little cakey and move around, even with powder. It's especially bad under the nosepads of glasses. However, it was pretty good at controlling oily parts of my face, even though this is targeted towards dry skin.
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I love this foundation and it's really good for the price. It's kind of my go-to when I need foundation asap or don't wanna spend $25+ on foundation. It honestly is just as good as some of the pricier options. It creates a dewy look, as advertised. This is good when you have dry skin like me. Just add a little powder with your T-zone and you're good to go or facial spray if you're super dry. Also, did not break me out.
I bought the 225 medium buff and I'm surprised what a wonderful color match it is! It gives a beautiful finish, very build-able and lightweight. What I love about this is that since the color matches me so perfectly I don't have to wear it all over my face. I use it only where I need it.One little regret I have is that I should've gone for the Matte & Poreless line. The one I have is Dewey and Smooth(cuz I have dry skin), I cannot complain, it looks beautiful but at a closer look it does settle into my pores. I might have to use a primer. I'm taking one star away for settling in my pores!
Amazing coverage but the transfer is horrible cute for pictures not for long wear
I love this foundation! I have about 3 different shades. 332 334 & 310. At some point due to the seasons changing my skin tone change. 334 is definitely my summer color. 310 is the dewy finish which I like in the winter as well as the  332 matte.
Iv bought this several times. It helps keep my face moisturized. Goes on very well with beauty blender. I do wish it lasted all day but I do love it.
Okay this stuff is awesome! Blends beautifully and looks great. You cannot beat the price.
For the last 5 years or more, I’ve been using “high end” make products.  Like IT, Laura Gellar, etc.  Obviously, pricey.  I saw the pretty good reviews on this foundation and I ordered the soft tan.  When it arrived, it looked like it might be too dark.  But it was a perfect shade.  I have blonde hair, blue eyes and usually order medium.  I wore this today for the first time and ran errands.  It went on great, looked great and, 8 hours later, still looks great.  Maybe I will picking up more drug store make-up!!  :).
This makeup is SO lightweight and I feel it's medium coverage (which I prefer so it looks like my skin but better). After watching countless reviews on YouTube, I was able to find my perfect shade (240) during a time where you can't get samples.I definitely look flawless and it doesn't make my skin oily at all (I have combination skin).Recommended!
It is a very good product, it worked on my face
For years I used the matte and poreless version and it's a wonderful product but my shade warm  nude was never available in the matte selection so I purchased the dewy version in the exact same color and I'm very happy I did! I have dry skin and the matte version sometimes made my skin have dry patches where my skin was dry but the dewy foundation hid all the dry patches on my face and made me look radiant! I know everyone says this oxidize fast but I've had no trouble with that. Very natural looking! This is now my go to foundation!
Nice coverage. In question as to if it had been opened or a returned  item.  I am use to products sealed and hard to remove pkg. This hd no seals on bottle or inside cap.
Finally a makeup that doesn’t make me break out! My skin looks so dewy and healthy when I wear this.
I have neutral undertone and this appeared extremely orange on me. There is no guide for choosing shades based on undertone!
Good brand to purchase
I love it! It’s everything it is advertised to be.
Texture is creamy, devine. Medium coverage is so smooth. The best ever ...I may have unlocked a key. Dab Pink Madison firming cream six - eight times around lip, forehead, cheeks, and chin areas. Spread/ smoothe over skin (not massage) with fingertips  Have your cereal, fruit n coffee. Fifteen minutes later apply this lusciously creamy foindation. Create a natural LITE even all over with a brush or sponge if possible. Skip the areas of your face that do not need medium cover. Hope this helps!! Reall, really happy with mine.
I hate makeup and have really bad skin. I have rosacea/acne. I bought this as a last-ditch effort. I bought it in two different colors. It perfectly matched my skin (their website had a tool to help me find the right shade with a selfie). It doesn't feel like I'm wearing makeup. Seriously. I just apply it with my fingers.
I would have given this 2 1/2 stars, I don't dislike it but I don't think I have much use for it. Some pros: it is lightweight, not cakey, doesn't settle into fine lines, but wore off after a couple hours. I don't mind doing a concealer touch up but I don't like having to bring foundation with me to re-do my foundation by lunchtime. It is a good color for very fair skin, and a good neutral - neither too yellow or too pink. I would probably not buy again unless I found a good makeup setting spray that made it stay on longer, then I would give this another try since I like the feel of it.I will say though that if you only need makeup very briefly - like for just taking a photo or quickly going on an appointment you need to have some makeup on for an hour or two - this has nice coverage and is not an obvious looking makeup as some foundations. For this purpose, I think it is pretty useful.
This is a nice foundation that isn't heavy or a full coverage makeup.  It gives a nice natural look to skin and doesn't give that "too much makeup" look on mature skin.  It is easy to apply and blend.  I really like this Maybelline New York line and I want to try some powder if it's available.  That would be nice to set the makeup and to help with oily skin.  A nice product.
I just cant sleep without leaving a perfect review for this Foundation, it is the best and it matched perfectly with my skin color. I ordered the shade Pure Beige actually it was fine but ta bit light for me and its not the products fault at all because I am trying all the shades. Ive been using Sand and Beige in other brand and I feel like lately I got darker and all the foundation ive been using makes my face so light and doesnt match my neck and shoulders its like cake, so I tried the Toffee!!! and its the best shade ive ever used, everyone's telling me my face looks flawlessly tan, its so easy to apply and it dry so quick. Really perfect for my dry skin. I SO LOVE IT SO MUCH...
It’s buildable so you can add more on if you need it. It’s not dry and cakes like other foundations. However I hope amazon can carrying a wider range of shades as it’s not my exact fit.
I love this product. It's great for people who are just starting out in make up. The matte one is a bit lighter and has more shades but the dewy is perfect for my skin. It's a light to medium coverage and buildable. It blends easy. I always use this brand.
I like this product because you can find a shade nearly exact to your skin tone, no matter what it is. Whether I am tan during the summer or pale in the winter months, I can find a shade that works for me. I usually use the matte version of this foundation, but I wanted that dewey glow that's popular right now so I bought this one. I will say that the color is spot on perfect, but the actual consistency of the foundation is very light coverage. It goes on well, but I need to re-apply it at least once during the day to keep the same coverage. Blends super well, though.
I got a sample of this in the mail and took a chance and tried it. I was amazed at the coverage and figured it was just a fluke. But, I just had to order it and see if the full size was just as good. When I saw how cheap this makeup was, I almost didnt bother ordering it because how good could it really be for this price of around $5....  all I can say is WOW! I have medium skin tone with combination skin and my skin is picky so I guess it might be a little sensitive. I only have to put a little of this and it covers my blemishes and feels really light. For $5 everyone should try it!! I would suggest going to the store first though, so you can see the color you should get. You really cant tell online how a color is next to your skin.
I ordered this foundation after buying the bare minerals bare skin, and hating it.  I've only used this once and I did like it.  I ordered color 220, but I think I could have gone up a color.  I also wish it had been a bit more dewy than it appears.  I'm having a very hard time finding that perfect dewy foundation.  This has very good coverage.  And it doesn't feel heavy or  greasy.  I should mention my complexion is really dry though.  I have to say for about 6 dollars you really can't beat this foundation.
This product is smooth and dewy, but it's like 2 shades darker with warmer undertones then the shade Classic Ivory 120 (for pore coverage) this is 120 Classic Ivory (dewy smooth). Idk, both nice but they'er not the same color.
The foundation itself is great, but there is a big difference between the same shade in the two different formulas. I normally get the matte formula but decided to try the dewy formula in my usual shade and it was way darker than it should be. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until it was too late to return the foundation. Luckily, it's not too expensive - which is a plus for this product.
Sooo less expensive than others and color is perfect match, I have medium skin, it’s smooth and looks natural, not oily , easy to wash off.
I used this very inexpensive foundation one day. At the end of the day, my hubby told me I looked pretty. What? I asked why. He doesn’t have the female vocabulary to express it. But it turns out my makeup had lasted through the day and still looked fresh after work. Okay, I’m 55 years old. I’ve used expensive foundations. This $6 bottle of magic made my oblivious husband notice a difference. Yes. I will continue using this amazing inexpensive makeup.
I like this foundation. Remember that if you have dry skin like I do, you'll want to order the dewy and not the matte. I think that the only issue I have is that by the end of the day I'm looking a little shiny.  I do start off the day with a bit of a glow from the product,  but since I have dry skin, that's not a bad thing. For the price, I would recommend trying this out. I enjoy it and think that it's a good drugstore buy for sure.
Really like this foundation. Color was a great match. Coverage was ok but buildable.
Peanut butter face
Super lightweight! Absolutely love this product!
It shows 4. We received 2 & they do not hold air overnight so it’s impossible to plan the night before.
i have tried several well rated low priced liquid & creme foundations recently and this one has produced as promised. The price is great & with my dry mature skin the moisture is great while staying sheer. I finally found what i’ve been looking for 🥰
It doesn't appear smooth on my skin. It looks dry.
i lovee this foundation it really feels and looks just like skin and like i have nothing on my face. its more of a light medium coverage, i have freckles and they still show through lightly AND FOR 5 DOLLARS ?!??! sound like a deal to me
I have used this foundation before and was excited when it was cheaper as an add-on item.That being said, I knew my shade prior to purchasing it. For reference, the It is a pretty good dupe for the Smashbox 15hr Chestnut shade 4.3, colorwise.It does look natural and the same as when I first applied it after about 9 hours. I did not use a mattifying primer. I did use the NYX matte setting spray, but my nose was still oily 5 hours into wearing it. My T-Zone still had some shine, but the rest of my face was O-K. It arrived undamaged in bubble-wrap, true to how it looks in stores. It feels light, gives great coverage, and looks good with my MAC Studio Fix powder on top.BEWARE, I received the Dewy and Smooth finish. Not what I wanted, since I already struggle with oily skin.It does say packaging may vary. I will, however, stick with my Smashbox because this can come off very orangeish.
Unfortunately, this went to the wrong address and I had to send it back- but I went and picked up the same product at target and it is amazing. Great budget-friendly make up
Product doesn't match. Ordered 2 different colors for my pale skin and one is too dark, the other is too light. Product wears off quickly especially when you have to wear a mask all day. This is gross and annoying. I like both the dewy and Matt look. This dewy product feels good on my dry, sensitive skin.
It’s really good and this is not my first time I buy this. Love it and will order more for sure
I LOVE this foundation, it is my go-to and I have never found one I liked so much.  Light to medium coverage, definitely dewy.  It is so blendable and melts into skin, looks very natural and skin like compared to other foundations.  Some cons are that it has trouble drying down, use a setting powder!  If you are super oily beware!  I have dry/normal skin and this works for me. It also doesn’t last forever but that doesn’t bother me, it tends to slowly go away but doesn’t leave creases or blotches.
Great foundation especially for the price. I got the Golden beige shade. I wasn’t expecting much for the price but I was pleasantly surprised. Goes on easily and I love the dewy finish.
I’m 59 with normal to dry skin. This product is great.  Doesn’t sink into wrinkles.  I will stop buying the costly foundation.  You can get great results without spending a load of cash.  I’m trading in my $30 tube of foundation for Maybelline NY Fit Me Dewy and Smooth.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed, light, not heavy feeling all the while giving great coverage.  The first time I used it my husband just kept staring at me.  He said you look amazing today!
It goes on really easy and it has full coverage. It looks pretty smooth, and with the right primer, it’s not too cakey. I have super sensitive skin but this doesn’t have any affect on it. It’s a perfect color too!
It looks ok, but I STILL have to mix it with moisturizer so that my skin doesn't dry out. Hence the 1 star deduction. Once applied, however, it definitely makes my skin look flawless (I also use a pore reducing primer). It lasts all day and it looks natural on me. You can barely tell I have it on.Overall, I absolutely love it. Despite needing moisturizer added in, I love the results. A little bit goes a LONG way.

I’ve been wearing this base for 6 years now.  I love it! It is light weight but it can be layered.  It is the only one that has worked in my very dry skin.
i guess i am too pale for the stores around me, so i was excited to find my shade here bc i love this product!!! it was also $3 cheaper than i can usually find it
Been using this since forever. The color matches perfectly.
I usually use the olay & Cover girl, Buff beige. I ended up getting the Ivory 120. The color is a tint lighter than my normal shade. It goes on smooth but,I wish it had a dispenser. You have to dump it out:( The price was good so I will probably keep it. I have dry skin and this does give me a dewy finish. Overall, I would have rated 5 stars if it had a pump on it.
Shade 118 Used a poreless primer and this stuff literally staid all day super smoothShade 105 swatch appears true warm undertone but in reality it’s a cool tone very disappointed I was truly hoping it was as described but oh well it’s alwat a struggle with foundation
I love this product. I have lived most my life (I'm 34) wearing minimal makeup (usually a lil eye liner & mascara), but as I get older I feel like I need a lil something to cover a few little wrinkles (yikes!). Anyway, after a long strew of buying incorrect colors, but trying to make it work anyway, I came across this on their site. It had a test to see what is best for you. It was so dead on, I was so surprised.  Others had tests, but didn't work. This feels like you have no makeup on, and doesn't look cakey or anything - just that you have smooth, unblemished skin!I usually don't write reviews,  but felt I should seeing that I bought this based off reviews :)
Give it a 4 star because one flaw witch is DONT close all the way
This is my new holy grail foundation!!! I have really dry skin so the dewy finish and moisturizing formula are great for my skin type. It also feels very light while covering redness and blemishes.
I love this foundation! My skin is super dry and this foundation makes my skin so dewy ! The finish is so beautiful. If you have dry skin you should try it!
I have skin that gets oily fast but mattifying foundation doesn't look good on me. Matte ones emphasize my dry spots and my blemishes. I now prefer natural looking light to medium coverage foundation and then i spot conceal blemishes. This has become my favorite. It gives me a natural looking medium coverage. I love it so much and the price is awesome here. Try it even if u have oily acne prone skin like me! Just set it with powder.
It looked cheap on my skin and quickly oxidizes to a trump like orange.
Product is extremely dark….should be called Dark Tan!
I have really light skin and often find it really hard to get makeup that works/fits my skin. This foundation provides pretty good coverage, and is lightweight. Also, you don't need to use very much of it at all which is nice. I use Dr. Jart + BB cream, then this foundation, and I cover it with Bare Minerals  Matte powder, and this combination works really nicely on my skin. Like I said, I am really pale, so this is the closest thing I've found to my skin tone (it is not as white as I'd like but it does the job). I will probably buy another bottle when I'm through with this one. Maybelline products are generally always a good buy.
I'm shocked at how great this foundation is for a little I paid. I was in need of something with good coverage and stay power and this was perfect, and what makes it even better is it doesn't break the bank! If you haven't tried Fit Me then I would highly suggest you do. My skin type is normal to dry ( especially dry in the winter) so I purchased the "dewy" and I'm in love! My skin breathe, and it doesn't leave my skin thick and sticky feeling either! It blends out nicely, has great coverage and lasts me all day long! I will be buying this foundation again! I highly recommend this for anyone who is looking for good quality, coverage, and affordable foundation.
I like how well this foundation matched my skin! I'm very pale and a lot of foundations are too dark for my skin tone. It also spreads very easily with a makeup sponge
This is such a good foundation and an exact match..!!! What can I ask for more? And its only 5 bucks. This doesn’t cake on face. Applies beautifully.
I am not crazy about liquid foundation but I am a fan of Maybellines concealers so I decided to give it a try.  The color was perfect color for my fair skin. It's a thinner foundation so its not heavy feeling on my face. It blends very smoothly and evenly. Considering I am not a fan of liquid I do like this one. I normally wear the  Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse Foundation, and I definitely still prefer it over the Fit me but if you like liquid foundations I would definitely recommend this!
I rarely wear foundation, but I do, I wear this. It is darker than my skin, but it blends evenly and I like the final look. I don't like to apply this with my fingers, and I refuse to use sponges or brushes, so I no longer wear this. It'd have to be a very special occasion for me to wear makeup nowadays. For now, I only wear bb cream, and even that's not daily.You will need a setting powder and/or spray with this product. I always felt particularly slick with it.
One of my favorite goto's for foundation. My skin looks beautiful when I wear it. Will definitely purchase again.
This product is absolutely amazing. I've spent quite a pretty penny looking for the right foundation and this one is THE one. I love that there are so many different tones and finishes to choose from, which is convenient to make an easy switch depending on the season. I've purchased this product many times and have no plans to stop.
It works well but didn't last longer on my skin
I ALWAYS USE NYX DROP FOUNDATION IN SHADE BUFF, IT MAKES MY SKIN LOOK AMAZING BUT IT GETS DRY .. I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE MOISTURIZING & THIS FOUNDATION IS DEFINITELY THAT!HOWEVER: IT DOES NOT BLEND GREAT [ I TRYED MY NYX FOUNDATION BRUSH AND A BEAUTY BLENDER ] LEAVES MY SKIN OILY & YUCKY.... I JUST FELT STICKY AND GROSS AFTER PUTTING THIS ON.POWDER DID NOT EVEN HELP!SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR MOISTURIZING THEN YES IT DOES THE TRICK.BUT FOR BEAUTY REASULTS NOPEEEE!COMFORTABLE? NOPEEEEEEE!
Use the tool on Maybelline's website to find out which shade you need, then buy it here on Amazon for a great price. Wasn't a foundation wearer til I tried this product!
This same product cost me $2 more at my.local drugstore...I also bought this as an add on so it was a bit cheaper.Nothing wrong with the coverage, stays all day as long as you're not sweating:-)This said Ivory but it was a bit on the pink side...for me, i prefer less pink tone as I'm quite fair skinnedBut I'm very happy with the price and coverage
This is such a good product, I really loved it. It looks great on my skin and looks very dewy. Would recommend to anyone looking for that inner glow look. No complaints really, I love how it looks on the skin
I really like this product but the thing is that it wasn't what I thought. See, I was searching through the Maybelline liquid foundations and there were two kinds of this FitMe! Foundation. There was the dewy kind and the matte kind. I passed on the dewy because I'm trying to avoid a wet looking face, and chose this one assuming it was matte. But I was wrong. It's dewy. So that kind of caught me off guard, but actually when I tried it on it wasn't so bad. Especially after I brushed on some of the FitMe! Matte powder. So it all turned out great! The color was exactly as expected and matches my skin tone perfectly. So it was a lovely surprise.
I love this foundation because of the price but it also works great for my dry skin. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because it really needs to come with a pump component. I don't use a lot of foundation at once so opening and closing the bottle numerous times allows for the product to oxidize and change colors over time. I know a pump would up the cost a bit but it would be worth it. Other than that, its a good product.
I've been using this type of foundation for years and been happy with it.  The colour is a little different, but I'm not sure what is at fault.  By this, I mean that I use this, and then put a Maybelline Fit powder on top.  My powder is 120, and the liquid is 115, but when I put the powder on it lightens everything up.  Either the liquid is darker or the powder is lighter.
This is an awesome product for the price. I’d buy again and again.
I purchased this after researching "The best foundation" on the internet.  Despite this being a tad darker than I wanted, I mixed it with the foundation color one step lighter, which was purchased first and was too light for me.  I wish there was a better way of buying exactly the right shade the first time.  That aside.  I love the feel of this foundation.  I think it holds up during the day quite well.  It also has a nice fragrance.
It is amazing! I honestly love this stuff! It doesn’t sit on top of my skin like other products have. It blends in and is perfect for everyday use.
I cant seem to find the right shade with this but I love how it looks and feels on my skin.
Great product! I have spent up to $30- $50 in the past trying to find a foundation that doesn't make my face look dry, cakey, or that doesn't settle into the wrinkles in my face only to be sorely disappointed. I was still sceptical even after reading all of the great reviews but for the price I figured it was worth a try. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  So glad I gave it a try!
This is my favorite liquid foundation! I had never used it until I purchased on here! I was pleasantly surprised with how well it matched my skin color especially since I wasn't able to see it in person before buying. I used the match me finder on Maybelline to find my color. I like that this foundation has SPF in it to help protect my skin from the sun, so I don't have to worry about applying any sunscreen before or after applying my foundation. This foundation has offered me great coverage & it lasts all day, even in the heat whenever sweating happens! I will be purchasing more of this foundation for sure, it is by far my favorite!
Not the true match. I took the test to match but I still feel it doesn't quite match. I do like that it's light and easy to apply.
Moisturize before using!! It's amazing and for fair skin so if your pale this is it! You can build up coverage cause the first layer is a sheer finish. Throughout the day my face gets dewy but at first putting it on its almost like a powder foundation, which i recommended as well. The consistency is runny would work better with a pump, but you can't beat that price!
I'm thrilled with this foundation, matches my skin color so well. It's not to heavy and is easy to spread. Will definitely repurchase.
I have extremely fair skin, and the “fair porcelain” is perfect for me. Lightweight, average scent (nothing too overpowering), and no caked on feeling. Worth it for the price!
I've been using this foundation for a couple years now.  I got it because it was recommended as a cheaper dupe for the Nars foundation.  It comes very close to the Nars foundation and has the added benefit of a sunscreen.  I buy Dewy because it helps hide my wrinkles better and add moisture to the dry areas on my face, but I've used the matt poreless and it's really good, as well.  If you like liquid foundation, and you find a close enough color match, you will really like this product.  It truly covers well and makes me look younger without feeling heavy or greasy.
It is so easy to apply and is very long lasting. Will definitely buy again. At first I thought this toffee 330 (Dewy smooth) would be too light for me but it was a great match. I also use 335 classic tan on occasion. I do not mix, they both fit me really well individually.
This is the best foundation ever.  It’s clean, sheer, flawless and looks so natural.  I have wasted $$$ on expensive foundations and I’m sticking to this!
Really like how this makes my skin look.Pros:It's lighter coverage than other foundations I've used, but it also looks and feels nicer - less cakey and my face doesn't feel like it's sealed under a heavy foundation.Skin really does look smooth, soft, and brightGood summertime foundationA little bit goes a long wayCons:I have some redness to my skin, and it doesn't necessarily cover that up like other heavier foundations.It is rather liquid-y so you have to use caution with using too muchBecause of consistency, I don't love applying it with a sponge, feels like more of the product gets wasted
This color is too dark to be porcelain
not the coverage I expected.
I really do like this foundation but it's not as full coverage as I would like but it's still great and makes my skin feel good too
Good quality. Fast shipping. Thanks.
Medium coverage, easy to apply. I like the price and don't think it's necessary to pay department store prices for foundation. The only thing I splurge on is Chanel loose face powder. Worth every dime.
I really like this product. Yes, when you first apply it, it looks very greasy, but it fades as it sinks into your skin and if you apply powder on it. I have pretty dry skin so that is probably why, do I wouldn't recommend this to anyone with oily skin. But the colors don't go super fair and 115 Ivory looks pretty yellow and tan on me. I probably just got the wrong shade though...
Easy to spread but not good enough.
overall very easy to spread gives me a natural look And it for sure will acheive you the look you want no matter if you wanna go natural or full on caked up hope this helps :)!!<3
Love. It def leaves face dewy and hydrated. Can be a bit sheet but it’s buildable. It does transfer, and doesn’t last as long but no biggie.
I bought this to use for summertime. I use a lighter shade in the winter and it blends well. It covers well too.
I'm used to using Matte products, so using this new foundation has been different. But it does last and is easy to spread I just wish the color didn't rub into my skin as much. It would be nice if it actually gave me a fuller coat on my skin.
Much darker than the shade
I have really fair skin, I don't tan but burn and my main issue is neutralizing redness. I have tried a bunch of brands in their lightest shade and they all look orangey on me. This was no exception, a bit less than others but still has a peach tinge to it. I purchased this with high hopes because my usual is hard to find, I need to order from China and it takes a while. For reference and maybe to help someone with the same issue, my go-to product is Laikou nursing effects protector in the pink shade. If more redness needs to be neutralized mix the pink and the green shade and it's the best for the fairest of the fair.
It was opened by someone. Too lazy to return
I absolutely love this product!  It gives my skin a "glow" and not a matte look.  I get more compliments on my complexion when I wear this cover-up.  Sidenote, I have normal to dry skin.
I don’t feel like I’m THAT white but 110 is way to orange. Fair porcelain ended up matching way better after trying four different ones!! But I do love this foundation.
Very nice
It's oily, first of all, and too much of a watery texture that it covers very poorly; it does even out the skin tone at the beginning, but it fades very fast. The worst thing of all is how the color gets so terrible throughout the day. I'm an Asian with normal Asian skin tone, so I chose the shade nude beige, since it matches my skin tone so well, or at least it seemed to. When it was first applied it seems to blend in very well, it doesn't really cover anything though, and with a feeling that all my pores are blocked and my skin can't breathe. Anyways, just about 3 or 4 hours later, when I look in the mirror, I see a red to brown face with patches of uneven color. That is horrible! Not only was it darker than my original skin tone, but it also gets my face all that redness and unevenness as if I got a bad tan. It might be the SPF ingredients that caused so, but this is a foundation product, people expect to get a stable coverage from it. And then it's oily, too oily as for such low SPF. It doesn't stay on well either, when I try to blot the oil on my nose and forehead, it would be taken off just like that, leaving my nose red! So then I have to apply some other foundation powder product. This is a pretty inexpensive drugstore foundation after all, but really, it's not worth it.
good light coverage
The color was off....The product was open...Extremely oily... For the 1st time in years I receive a purchase from Amazon that I am skeptical to use and does not live up to my expectations.
I wanted to like it. I suppose it’s okay s long as I don’t put it anywhere near my under eye area. I am 46 and it immediately settles into fine lines under my eyes.
It’s ok.
I normally use a light beige but this one was more like ivory to me. It felt greasy and was too shiny. I have combination skin so maybe better for dry skin. I also didn't like how it pours out, no pump dispenser.
40 year old skin here. I don’t like foundation, but decided to try this since it’s moisturizing and has added SPF. I’m very impressed, doesn’t cake or fall into lines. Sheer, but evens tone. I like it. And the price can’t be beat.
I have dry skin, and though this was super moisturizing, my skin still became dry after using. It was easy to spread, whether using your fingers or a sponge, and it lasted from morning to night. If you have extra dry skin, you probably should use a strong moisturizer before applying foundation. Will buy again
Always been a favorite
I always have a problem with my skin drying out even more when I put on foundation but this one is very moisturizing. Love this product and the price is a plus!
I like it thanks
Very good wear-everywhere product. Not too thick but still provides coverage. You can even layer for fuller coverage and it doesn't look "cakey" or feel heavy. I have combination skin and this is perfect for it. I don't need to moisturize before and it doesn't patch up either. I love it! I've  always been hesitant to try different foundations and makeup brands but I  really liked this one. I also haven't had any skin reactions or break outs from it and I  have very sensitive skin. Just make sure you get the right shade so it works well. I would definitely buy again!
This is a decent lightweight coverage foundation. Leaves you feeling dewey and moisturized.  One down side is that it does seem to oxidize a bit more than others I've used.  So I would suggest maybe a shade lighter.
Goes on smooth, wears extremely lightweight and has a dewy finish as promised. I've found the best way to apply this foundation is with a beauty blender. Love Maybelline for this foundation.I purchased the dewy and matte finish in 360 Mocha and attached pictures showing the difference in colors and finishes. The color is pretty much dead on, I just noticed that the dewy formula has a more warn undertone to it while the matte finish has more of a cool undertone to it if that makes sense. All in all, I love both formulas. I also showed the swatch when first applied and then once it dried.Dewy Finish: On LeftMatte Finish: On Right
I have sensitive skin and this is the only foundation I will use. I apply with a kabuki and blend with a sponge when needed. I have blonde hair and a fair complexion and always found it hard to find a durable foundation that didn't break me out, dry out my skin or tint me too orange until I tried this! I highly recommend it. This 210 shade is a good color for me all year, I don't have to change shades even when I get a base tan in the summer. It holds up well all day, looks smooth and natural.
One of my favorites that doesn't make me break out
This was great price more than half of what I pay in the store.
This foundation looked horrible on my skin, it clung to dry spots and didn't spread evenly with my beauty blender. It creased as well settling into my lines.
I loved this shade. It is very skin color looking. When I use it people didn’t recognize I’m wearing foundation. Many compliments me saying “nice skin”. It is not dry . It is perfect for skin like mine which I have normal . This doesn’t look dry when you wear them. It gives you perfect shiny glowy look. Loved it. Ready for buying 1 more. My friends are also loving it and how it responded on their skins and they wanted to buy as well.
My new favorite go to foundation! This foundation is the perfect weight and texture! Not too think and not too sheer with just the perfect amount of dewyness. I have normal to dry skin, use a primer underneath and am 37 years old. I have zero issues with this foundation sinking into fine lines and have found the slight sheen to actually gloss over any tiny wrinkles and make them seem to disappear. I have had a really hard time finding a foundation that didn't dry my skin out or make it flake until this foundation. Love it!!!
Love this make up; price is right and has the right shade I need. I always get compliment on my make up when I wear it.
I am completely blown away at how great this inexpensive foundation is!  I am 53 and my skin is a little dry and aging.  This foundation spread so easily and gives my skin a dewy finish, without looking like I have makeup on.  This is even better than a foundation I purchased at the cosmetic counter for over $50!  Definitely recommend!
Nice coverage, feels light, soft, moist and creamy. The best, lightest, non-drying foundation I've ever used. My 51y.o. skin had been changing and my old foundation started sitting in the fine lines of my eyes and mouth. This one does not! I've been told I look "glowy"! What a lovely compliment that is! It seems to be the perfect foundation for dry or aging skin. It not very pricy at all and comes in a decent array of colors. It's worth trying it for the price.
comes off with the slightest bit of water, arrives open already and spilling out all over the place. pretty sure this is a used product so be wary. color is off, feels dry. overall just nasty
This is my absolute favorite foundation. I have dry skin and this goes on smoothly. It isn't too heavy and it has never broken me out. It just looks beautiful on my skin. I'll never buy anything else. I hope they never discontinue it!
If you are like me , you do not want to enter any drug store, walmart, or anywhere else you may buy your makeup. I know its like rolling the dice buying makeup online, but you can't go wrong when you go Maybelline on Amazon. Perfect color match every time!
Good fondation, during long time
This, truly, is a favorite for me.  I have used this for a long time.  I like the lightness of it allbecause it don't feel heavy thick.  It just feels natural and doesn't leave your face feeling dry!
Great coverage and easy to apply. I wish it was in a tube instead of the glass bottle.
I wish it had a wand or pump.  The color is perfect just very messy because you have to pour it out.
I usually wear the matte 110 porcelain version of this. However, I ordered without knowing it's the dewy version. I feel the dewy version is very orange. The matte has more of a yellow tone. I find orange patches on my face when it oxidizes too. Why does the matte one match my skin flawlessly and this one is considerably darker??  If you are super pale like I am, I would highly suggest the matte version. But it does offer the same coverage. I use a setting powder on it which makes it matte rather than dewy, because my skin feels greasy with this foundation. That's more of a personal preference though. I will likely use this more in the summer, when I have a little bit of color in my skin.
I love the product its self. The only thing I'm upset about is the fact that the packaging was bad and most of my product had already spilled out by the time it was delivered to me.
This product was as I expected and it was the right color for me. Sometimes its hard to buy ones online and your not sure which to get because your afraid if it may be dark or to light. This was just right and I really like how it makes it look like its natural. I like that this gives natural coverage that leaves the skin fresh, breathing, and natural effect on your skin. This doesn't leave that oily feeling and it feels more natural and makes your skin look beautiful. Its really hard to find ones that make you look like you have that natural look and feeling.
The first foundation I've found that doesnt pill or flake on my face! I have really dry skin, and large pores. This, over my water-based moisturizer and e.l.f. poreless putty primer, easily goes on, smooths out, and lasted all day. I didnt even need a setting powder over it. Its light, and just looks like my natural skin.
No safety seal
I've been using the Matte + Poreless foundation in 110 Porcelain, but wanted to try the Dewy + Smooth also. As you can see from the photo, the Dewy 110 is a good 2 shades darker than the Matte 110.  The consistency is very nice. I'll keep it for my neck and in case I get a tan
I love this foundation! This product is such a great buy for the price and if you know how to use makeup, there is little difference between drug store and high end makeup. For foundation especially.Besides that, this blends so perfectly and goes on smooth. The only issue I have is the way the bottle is designed. This makes it hard to get product onto a sponge and ultimately makes my makeup routine take a bit longer.
I liked the coverage and how smooth it went on
Price was right but no way to tell what color you need. Description needs improved - i purchased three colors bc i didn’t know what color i needed.
This is a Light-Medium coverage, great for dry skin and applies on easy. The only downside is it’s not as long lasting, otherwise great buy!
It’s just skin fitting no matter it’s summer or winter :) I have been using this now a little over 3 years! It’s super buildable too
I’ve never tried Fit Me before and honestly it is an amazing foundation.. I purchased these to put in my kit for my clients
I have tried so many upscale foundation brands: Armani, Lorac, MAC, iT, Clinique, Clarins and though Armani was it for awhile, I have never gotten compliments the way I have since I started wearing this foundation 2 weeks ago. So many people including a cosmetologist told me how beautiful my skin looks, how pretty and fresh I look and I'm past 50!! I use this all over with a bit of matte+poreless on my T zone and my skin looks almost flawless
Formula is good. Applied it by hand the first time and it looked like the wrong shade. May have to use a sponge to even that out but feels soft and goes on smooth and seamlessly
Love this foundation.  Perfect colour for my pale, pale skin and no irritation on my overly sensitive skin.  It is truly amazing that none of the other, much more expensive foundations have worked as well.  In fact, so many of them irritated my eyes and looked so orange on my skin, that I really didn't hold out much hope for this one.  Sadly, the ones that had worked so well in the past had been discontinued. I hope this one stays around for a while, but I'm stocking up just in case it doesn't.  Thanks for asking for my review.
I like this as much as the matte one. This spreads better and does give a dewy look. So.etimes I mix the 2.
I love this foundation, just warning the color i bought looked wayy darker in person then in pics..so maybe order a shade lighter then it looks
I am very fair skinned, have worn all Maybelline foundations in classic ivory, including this line. This was more of a Sandy Beige. Gave it to my niece who has an olive complexion. Worked perfect for her.
The product came shattered and there is no refund policy just return and I can’t return shattered glass.
Little to no coverage! Also, unless you have extremely dry skin this will be too oily for you! Even with setting powder I could not not keep this product from slipping off of my face!
This is the perfect product and goes great with my skin, but as the day goes on it gets darker. I only use it on the areas where I'll bronze over  because I love the finish but I need a different one for my T zone and highlighting areas. Might look into getting a super light one for those areas and hope it doesn't get too dark by the end of my work day.
Very nice coverage, easy to apply and a great price!
the product has a yellow color too it but it looks exactly as it is in the picture from the bottle.  I wear it all day and it doesn't seem too rub off and that is quite impressive considering i play volleyball for and hour and a half and do track but it does seem to blend pretty easily.  The reason i only gave it five stars was because it is more of a yellow color not a tan color but it goes a very long way.
This foundation is very sheer doesn't give full coverage.
Thanks it’s amazing
I received the one with spf in it,but that's not what's advertised here. Don't care for this foundation, nonetheless. I don't get the dewy look I was going for.
It seems to rub off under the COVID-19 masks I use during the day.  So, I take my little Maybelline bottle with me and reapply if needed when I take the mask off to eat when I'm out and about.
My favorite drugstore foundation. I didn’t care for the matte one but the dewy finish one is great. It doesn’t necessarily hold up as long as I would like but it’s still my fave
This is a great choice for dry skin. Many foundation's make my dry patches stand out, which is an obvious giveaway that I'm wearing foundation. This made my skin feel hydrated. It blends fairly easily, and I was able to build up the parts of my face that needed fuller coverage. The consistency is very liquidy. The smell is faint, but I would decribe it as smelling like sunscreen and baby powder. Product loses one star because it contains butylparaben and ethylparaben.
I'm a makeup artist. I used this on a well-known actress who was filming a movie locally. Her look required a very natural appearance and this foundation was perfect.
This is another great Maybelline product and even though I purchased it online, it was easy to guess which would be right for my skin color.  If you've purchased from them before, they tend to have the same color lines that cross over.  I have used this product prior and knew what to expect.  I like to wear this in the summer time because it is lightweight and doesn't feel so "cakey" with the coverage.  It has a moderate amount of coverage and I think works well if you use a power finish to go over it.
Pleasantly surprised that the lightest shade actually goes with my skin tone. I am fair skinned with freckles and this is buildable coverage - with a foundation brush you can build the coverage to conceal freckles, age spots, etc. The formula I received also minimizes pore appearance so it gives a smooth, matte finish. I actually forgot to put on setting powder the first time I used it because the appearance was so finished. I like this foundation a lot because having acne scarring and freckles, I want something that has buildable coverage but doesn't look fake. This has a very smooth nice appearance to it, and feels very silky going on.
This is a medium coverage foundation that works wonderfully.  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily.  I would say this foundation has an 8 hour wear before you need to add another application.  The application can be messy because the foundation is generally very runny and if the bottle is knocked over it will instantly spill out.  My advice for application would be to use a good foundation primer, brush, setting powder with a beauty blender and you'll have a flawless application.  In this picture I've used the maybelline fit me concealer too.
I love the matte poreless Fit Me foundation. It's the best foundation I've used. It is probably the only one I've ever used that I don't have to mix 2 colors together or have a funky foundation line. I love that it's inexpensive too. The only other foundation that was this good was $25 and was discontinued. I haven't even been tempted in the last 2 years to try another foundation. Word of caution when buying as an add on item, you may get the dewy foundation instead of the matte. So be careful when buying online.
So this foundation is comparable to the Smashbox hydrating foundation but at a much lower cost. I do love the smashbox foundation but I can't spend $36 on it anymore. This foundation is hydrating, light weight and the coverage is pretty good. It doesn't cling to all my dry patches like other foundations.
Separates and was the wrong color but the separation may be due to something other than this product. I pick the second to lightest shade and it is literally dark orange
I was so excited to try this product and then it arrived… My product came UNSEALED and lid of the foundation almost fell off in the package!! I also researched the batch number and it was from April 2021!! Very disappointed. Please read other reviews and save your money!
Great foundation but package was damaged
Excellent color and texture- perfect fit. One of the best drug store buys out there.
I have used this for several years.
Absolutely love it!!! I really didn't expect it to be so good for the price point!! It's very dewy and moisturizing!
I usually prefer Cover Girl because it agrees with my skin sensitivity more, but amazingly this product is not irritating at all and the color, which has a bit of a yellow tint, blends and matches my skin tone perfectly. It’s thin, not thick at all and seems to last the whole day.
This is my go to foundation. I typically keep 2 shades for when the season changes because it’s good for daily wear. Not Amazing as far as being blendable but it gets the job done and looks nice. Doesn’t clog my pores like some foundations do
I wasn't a fan of this foundation.  For the price I figured it was worth a shot and it was.  The color worked well for me but instead of feeling dewy and smooth it just felt watered down and hard to get coverage.  I have dry skin so that I like having moisturizing in my foundation but this one, unfortunately, was just not for me.
I am in love with this product never used foundation before and for only $6 you can not beat it this color matches my skin perfectly and blends so well I love this product I will definitely buy again and easy to use aswell for beginners
She says that it covers well, is easy to use, and lasts quite a while. The price is very reasonable.
I think everyone who uses Fit me says the same but it really is awesome. This is my 4th or 5th foundation and I am not using any other since I caught hold of this one. All you need to do is get the right shade for yourself. It took me a while to hit my shade. 240 is my perfect shade. Love this foundation to the core. A natural finish just the way I want.
I really liked the coverage this product was able to give. I gave it a 4 star only because I'm afraid of all the chemicals used in this product. I researched about it after buying the product. On EWG reviews, this product was a 6/10 (10 being super dangerous). I ended up buying a natural organic foundation recently. It makes me happy. But overall, if you don't mind the chemicals, this foundation is TRULEY the best drugstore foundation I've ever used. I chose the color simply by looking a reviews on YouTube and blogs, and it a tad lighter but I can still use it.
If you're looking for a sheer foundation with sunblock this is lovely moisturizing goes on great but it will not cover red spots brown spots age spots any kind of spots at all freckles forget it it's not going to cover anything.
The smaller than my index finger simply really don’t buy make up off of Amazon they’ll rip you off on it And it looks like it’s already been used and there’s no seal to her or anything
I love this makeup. It works perfect for me and my skin.  I would have loved to give this place a five star.  But,  make-up explored in the box it came in. I can still use what is left in bottle. But man oh man when this gets hot it goes everywhere. Hahah
darker than my skin tone
I’ve never tried expensive foundation, so I can’t compare. This is my favorite of all time. It’s like a combination of foundation and powder. Not watery. Not oily. Just feels smooth and nice on the skin. It provided good coverage of imperfections and smoothed out with a damp finger or sponge.
It seems to spread and cover well. Although it made my skin look dry.
I love fit me that’s the only make up The price is so cheap and good I’ll buy all my make up again here and love the products would highly recommend it
Product not good for all skin types. I put on very thin layer of foundation. I had an allergic reaction after just 1 usage.
I buy both designer and high end makeup and foundation. This one is a staple in my make-up bag! I have dry skin and like the dewy formula versus the matte, especially during Fall and Winter. Love the SPF in this as well. Blends easily, I use my fingers. Never looks caked on, looks my skin but better.
This made my skin more oily than it actually is.
Best drugstore foundation I've used. I usually get the matte version, but the regular kind doesn't hurt to have on hand as well for drier days, and you can just dust powder on for a less "moist" look. Especially with the matte stuff, make sure you put on some primer/moisturizer first to help minimize your pores. It is full coverage and now I just use it over a CC cream to perfect my T-zone.
I really enjoy applying this foundation on my face. It is true to the label it does leave my face dewy and smooth
Unfortunately this product did not work for me. It has low coverage and only lasted 3 hours on me. It did not cover the redness on my cheeks and my chin. I tried adding more in those areas but it did not work. It made my skin look blotchy. It also broke me out on my forehead and chin. I would recommend this product to those who need very minimal coverage for a very short period of time. It does not last a regular work day. I have combination and sensitive skin. I'm super bummed this product didn't work out given all the glowing reviews.
Moisturizingblendablesheer but buildablenot cakeyno harsh fragrancetons of product in the containerBUT it doesn't have a pump. Probably because it has a quite watery consistency.HIGHLY recommend.
It was surprising to get a nice product for this price considering there are a lot of foundations out there that are just really ridiculous in their pricing. So far it seems to be okay for my skin.
Not to thick. Looks natural and not cakey.
Nice medium coverage that feels good on my skin and great price.
I am an older woman with very pale skin which tends to be dry. This makeup goes on smoothly without primer and looks very natural, while hiding flaws and adding a natural luster to my skin. I am blessed that I dont have many wrinkles, but the few I have are not pronounced by this product. It does not cause irritation, clogged pores or breakouts on my face.  I love that the cost is very affordable and the quality is so wonderful. Great job Mabelline!
I love Fit me, the coverage is great! I use two colors for full coverage and it works great for me..The price is awesome for the coverage, I was a Mac foundation user for years until I found Fit me. I still use Macs concealer..
I am a upper 40's woman, and need a foundation that looks natural, not orange and feels light on my face.I took the "foundation quiz" on the Maybelline website, and went with the recommended # and style. I feel like the color is perfect. I may need to go a bit darker in the summer but this works great now. Easy to apply, stays put. Doesn't enhance my laugh lines. FINALLY found a make up that I like!
This is forever my go to foundation. The 2 package deal is also better then purchasing in stores because 1 costs about 9/10 dollars. Recommended for dark skin woman.And there were no leaks or spills. Packaged well.
As always! Arrived in-tact and the right shade. AND cheaper than Walmart! This foundation does oxidize a bit and will turn slightly after on your face a while but as long as you blend with a good loose powder, you will be fine!
Very happy with this make-up.  I don't use to much make-up.  This one is prefect for a natural look.
Would be a great foundation if it didn't oxidize so bad. It's really hard to match too because it's always darker than it is supposed to be.
The color is fit for me, but not as expected. It is going darkness after 3 hours and not stay long on my face. Anyway it does the job due to the price.
Break out in 2 days.not for me.
This is my favorite “drug store” foundation ! It goes on so pretty, it’s pretty full coverage, and will last for quite awhile. I do wear a matte powder over it since it is a dewy finish.
Great product. Goes on smooth & has no oily residue.
Super affordable and it does the job. I'm definitely buying this again as my new every-day foundation.
Ok for everyday wear to the office compared to price brands, which I typically save for special occasions. The fit me product is a good alternative if your looking to speak d less than $25-$30 for a bottle of liquid foundation.
Even though I purchased "Ivory", it was still a bit dark.  But other than that, application was smooth and the foundation lasted most of the day.  My only issue was that halfway through the day, my face started to get welts on it and feel itchy.  I wore it for several more days so my skin could get used to the foundation's formula.  But although the welts disappeard, my face still felt itchy.  I DO have sensitive, fair skin so it's always extremely difficult to find makeup that doesn't irritate me.  However, I would recommend this product because as I mentioned, it's a smooth, light formula that lasts most of the day.
Beautiful medium coverage! Perfect for dry/combination skin. I've found this works best with a beauty blender to absorb some of the shine. Careful about using too much around fine line areas, it likes to settle throughout the day if you're not a fan of setting powder.
Good foundation, applies well on skin. Medium coverage helps to even out  skin tone but a can still see my freckles.
This foundation glides on my skin and the color matches my skin very well.
Works okay, still left my skin flaky and powdery looking on my forehead and on my cheeks a bit, thought it would do better for dry skin.
Good match
I like this product because it really gives my skin a fresh look and is the perfect color for my skin tone. I don't care for foundation that gives a matte look. Matte makeup only works if you're about fifteen years old.
I have both the Matte Poreless and now the Dewy. i have combination skin, leaning on the dry side and this is beautiful on the skin. I do not wear concealer, though i should start, and noticed that i will need a little more coverage under my eyes, and this alone will not do it. Actually the Matte Porless works well under the ey as it is a little "thicker" consistency. I would say it is a medium coverage. feels light weight. new favorite foundation ever!
I bought this and thought the color was going to be to dark on me or orangey but I was wrong! The color is great and it’s so smooth and doesn’t dry out your skin. I apply over a pore minimizer cream and it stays on great! Good thing about this foundation is that it doesn’t give you a cakey look or dry out your skin!
The foundation is pretty good, not my favorite though. It's a little oily until it dries on your face, and it's very watery and also takes awhile to dry. I bought the color 120 soft ivory, the color I always purchase,  and the fit me foundation I got in the store was the same color I got on Amazon, but the one I ordered was much darker. My advice to you, is get a color one or two shades lighter then your normal color. Or just buy it in the store.
Maybelline Fitme foundation is my Go to and absolute favorite 😍 it gies on smooth and last through out my day I definitely recommend this foundation
I recommend it covers my skin good
I'm a medium brown skin girl and the 360 Mocha matched perfectly with my skin. I'm so obsessed and love it so much I started wearing makeup just for fun, even though I work from home.
not my skin tone
I like that this makeup moisturizes and provides spf in a lightweight, medium coverage makeup. I have a very active job that requires me to be outside most of the day and it’s been a great daily use makeup.
It wasn’t moisturizing it was oily or even greasy I have never used anything like it. It’s a medium coverage it turns orange from oil in it .
Greatest product ever especially for its great price ! It’s better than most brand item foundations !!!! :)
I have very fair skin. I get 125 nude beige. I have more dry some times acne prone skin. This has become my favorite foundation. It matches very well. It does not cause break outs. It does not cause more dryness. So far I really have no issues or complaints at all about this foundation. I have used it  probably at least 6 times already. It covers quite well. I am very happy with it.
The color matches perfectly with the pictures, and the product isn’t heavy at all on the skin. It doesn’t clump up or cause lines which is great! And of course the price is good.
I really like this makeup! After using this, my boyfriend told me I am more beautiful! The price is reasonalble. I even more like this than Lancôme. I really recommend it to you!
It’s for dry skin so it was oily and sheer and I put that on my oily combo skin and it’s more than likely my fault but for a light coverage dewy look this is for you!!
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Best quality for the price.  I have used plenty of expensive foundations before and while they are good, they don't measure up with this quality/price ratio.  I get this on ship and save as well.  I ordered shade 125 and somehow it was my perfect shade.  The picture is very close to what it is, so should be easy to estimate which shade you are.  I use this under my contour powders and bronzers - provides great but light coverage and is great for day and night wear.
It’s easy to make it into full coverage by layering. I love the dewy finish but hate that it gathers up in certain places on my face, I have to make sure to blend the hell out of it, but it looks great in the end.
my face never looked so smooth!! this is great because you get coverage without feeling cakey. absolutely fantastic for the price!!
I love this foundation, I got it 2 shades darker so I can mix it with my dermacol which is whiter than my actual skin tone. Foundation performs great!
I really love this. Must be applied with a damp beauty blender.  Comes off streaky with a brush.  The light shade looks good on my warm toned pale skin. It's not full coverage (but who would expect full coverage from the drug store?) but it is pretty close for cheap makeup. If you don't like the dewy finish, just put some finishing powder on and its perfect.
Very poor coverage.  More like a tinted moisturizer.
Ivory was a darker than any ivory shade ever too brown
Not drying and lightweight feel! I really like this foundation! @mandyglamdy for more looks on insta.
I love this stuff. It goes on thick enough to hide some of my red bumps (I have adult acne at 40) but not a caked on look. Get the right shade and it is a nice cheaper foundation. The companies website has an upload picture feature that really helps dial in on your shade. Highly recommend going and using that.
I liked everything but the color is a little orangey to my tone, other than that...doesnt last all day, ( but who wants to wear makeup 24/7?) Not I. Could be full coverage if you apply more I guess...not cakey.
You need a setting powder and spray for this to stay on! I thought I would love it from the reviews, but it just melts off my face. Thankfully I got it on amazon and not the store. Did not match my face tone. I got Fair Ivory, and it’s still slightly orange.
This is a great product, applies well, gives me the moisture I am looking for and otherwise great.  If it lasted longer it would get 5 stars
I love this foundation, I just wish they would make it without spf
covers well
I’ve been using FitMe dewy for about 3-4 years now. Love it.
This is the first foundation that I’ve used that doesn’t feel like it’s sitting on my face.
The reason I didn't give it five starts is because the shade didn't match my skin color, but this comes wherever you order anything online. Otherwise, I lived the products and how it fits on my skin. It makes your skin glow and it looks so natural. Definitely recommend but check your shade!
I’m still tryna match my color and I’m not having the best of luck but I’m almost there I recommend
goes on smooth, not heavy or greasy, and no cakiness as of yet.
Hard to tell from the pic, but the label is off center, the bottle looks warped and the cover doesn't screw on straight.  There is no expiration date on the bottle or label, and the product smelled bad and was an off (orange-y) color.  Loved this foundation when bought in the store- good coverage, nice finish and long lasting at a great price.
Its great makeup.And a big thank you to all delivery drivers who get all my items to me (and everyone else) in a promptly time during this coronavirus difficult time! Applause to you all!
Great product consistency-- much like a tinted moisturizer, at least when applied with the fingers like I do, which is exactly what I like. You can never see this product on my skin, it looks very natural and blends well. It is a tiny bit too dark for my skin tone, but for an American foundation, it's the best I've found to nearly match my fair skin. I'm going back to Asian bb cream for now though, because this really isn't my true match, but a great product formula, pleasantly surprising because almost every American foundation I tried looks cakey and unnatural.
I bought a different shade before but I tried this shade because it was cheaper and also I want to try if it matches my skin better. Wow, was I surprised. It perfectly matched my sun tanned skin. It looks like I don't have any foundation at all but the difference is my skin looks smoother and even toned. But I guess months from now, when my summer skin gets a few shade lighter, then I have to buy a lighter shade of this foundation.
The color was a perfect fit but I wish I ordered the matte version of this. Dewy definitely brings shininess too soon, maybe even as soon as 2,3 hours after applied.
I like it looks exactly online
I have very dry skin and even the more expensive liquid foundations would just make my dryness worse after a long work day. No longer will I pay $60+ for Urban Decay Naked Skin liquid foundation! This foundation is light weight, keeps my skin perfectly balanced (not too dry or oily), and has amazing coverage. And still looks fabulous at the end of the day. My only regret is that I wish I found it sooner!
Nice foundation with good coverage however this color was too light. So I’ll just use it as highlight.
my bottle arrived but i missed that it has Octinoxate. listing photos (& title) didn’t show that - most prominently display this feature  - but my bottle does.  i already use a safe spf product and always steer clear of this type of man-made (chemical) protection.into the trash it goes.
it came in broken the whole entire foundation was in the bag
I found that this foundation oxidized a bit througout the day and also didn't have enough shades for me to find a perfect match... but it was decent considering the price and 5+ hour wear without needing powdering or touch-ups. There is no funny scent to this formula, and it comes in a pour bottle which doesn't get messy if tighly closed.
I love this brand so decided to order this one from Amazon. It came a little lighter than I expected which is a bummer but I guess it could be worn in the winter time since thats when folks usually get lighter. I like that I don't constantly have to keep applying it and it lasts. I would just recommend checking your color in the stores before purchasing it online.
I was so excited for the sale on this product as i purchase this brand every time i need but i usually get the blue labeled ones.... i purchased my normal color i get at walgreens however the one i purchased here was VERY dark. For milano skin, which is beautiful however i am albino and so my neck and face now are very different shades lol. Im not pretty enough to pull off the two skin tone look unfortunately! But i did TRY it and mixed a small amount of white foundation from a shironuri makeup [geisha] set i had purchased awhile back and it turned out alright. Didnt want to return because i really need foundation for my job. Next time ill know to go lighter.
My daughter has very fair skin and it's hard for us to find anything light enough for her in the local stores without buying department store makeup. We found this one and she LOVES it. It is actually light enough for her and has a great finish. She loves how it goes on and the coverage she gets. Once she sets it with powder she doesn't have to mess with it the rest of the day. She is 16, but has dry skin. She still uses a light moisturizer underneath this foundation.
I'm sure there better foundations out there but this one is my go to foundation. It offers good coverage and my skin looks soft and even. With the use of a good primer, it lasts hours. It is inexpensive so that's plus.
Love how this color blends away all my redness and dark areas.  I have aging combination skin. Goes on smooth.  Ive stopped using primer with this foundation.  The dewy finish adds glow but i have to use a matte powder under my eyes to knock down the unnatural shine, not a big deal.  Best foundation I’ve ever worn overall
This product goes on easily, blends well, and can be paired easily with the matching concealer. Great for every day. Doesn't clog pores or make me break out. Also, very wide shade range!
Good color
I've always been a MAC girl when it came to foundation, but this is my new go to for a fraction of the price. I love this stuff! The color match is unlike any other foundation. I love the dewy formula and the matte, depending on what I am going for. It is very liquidy though, so I would recommended being careful when dispensing. The bottle might be better off with a pump to avoid waste. Still an A+ product.
I don't usually wear "drug store" makeup, but I'd recently tried another Maybelline product and was surprised by how good it was. When I found this on sale, figured I'd give it a shot. I got as far as swatching the color on the back of my hand and the scent of my mother wafted into my nostrils. No good. I love my mom but I do NOT want to smell like her.
Love the fit me products, medium coverage, super buildable, easy to use
Love the feel & color is a match
This is a very good foundation.  It gives me the coverage I want.  It does have a little bit of sheen so I use a neutral setting powder to take the sheen off and give me the look I want.As an Amazon Prime member this qualified as an add-on so I was able to add this to my order and receive free two day shipping.  My package arrived on time and in perfect condition.
No
I have a hard time finding foundation I like, and I'm highly pleased with this one.
This make up is good coverage for the price and gives you that dewy look.
I've bought this brand and this shade many times (porcelain) so I know what it should look like. The one I received was extremely darker than usual, and no safety seal (tape). The label on the cap and the bottle matched, so only other explanation is that it's expired and oxidized. Unless Maybelline let mispackaged foundation pass inspection and sent to Amazon.. It looks about 6 shades darker than "porcelain". So if you receive a much darker shade than expected, it's probably a mistake.
I was originally using Revlon PhotoReady when my friend suggested I try this. Her make-up is always flawless so I thought I would give it a try. I like that it feels lightweight. I do not like that the top is just open. I prefer having a pump. I like the sleek design of the bottle because it is very easy to fit in a makeup bag.
Gets the job done. You definitely get what you pay for though.
This is one of my foundation next to Bobbi Brown and Iman. This one make my skin glow, smooth, stay on longer and cover all the flaws on my face. I love it
If you don’t have a lot of money to spend on makeup - this is a good quality drugstore foundation for you. Super recommended for dry skin or people who like the Dewey look.
The product itself is satisfactory, but the bottle is not sealed with adhesive tape, and the bottle cap and bottle body cannot be aligned when tightening. I feel like I received a used product
Matches my skin perfect and works great, only thing that would make it better is an easier way to get it out of the bottle.
This product was good in every way except that it made me break out badly , I will have to return.
Good product
My skin is very demanding. It is dry, with lots of freckles. For someone it is very attractive, but for me this is a problem №1! I have tried many different foundations but they were hard to my skin and I felt uncomfortable. So recently, I decided to try something new for me Maybelline Fit Me! It is amazing. Very soft and light. It is easy to apply. This foundation smoothes the tone of my skin perfectly. My skin looks  well-cared and healthy )
It wasn't sealed when I received it.
I have tried many foundations, and this Fit Me Dewy is the best look and finish I've found for dry skin. I love the shade, covers redness, and doesn't make me look older. I even don't put all over and can blend a different one with it if I want to avoid t-zone if it's oilier than usual.
It was a gift for my wife. She said it works fine for her. It's my second time getting this product.
I bought the shade 360 mocha and it’s a completely different shade to the matte and poreless that’s fits me perfectly…. It’s definitely full courage but it’s not for me
Color: It is about 2 shades lighter than Revlon "Caramel"Pros: smooth and dewyCons: looks super dry after a while
This range seems so inconsistent with color. I always buy the classic ivory which isn’t actually as light as the shade leads you to think. The matte and the dewy are different colors in the same shade. I usually buy the dewy one in this color and this time I got it and I noticed the color is super dark, almost like a medium tan color...I love this foundation and have been using it for years but they must have changed the formula in some way because the color doesn’t match me anymore. Mind you I’ve literally used this shade and range for like 6 years.
I’ve always had a hard time with finding face makeup that’s easy to use, works well for me, and affordable. I am very happy with this foundation as well as the powder. It’s not heavy but there’s a fair amount of coverage.
It doesn’t cover much even when applying a good amount. It has a weird consistency and it just doesn’t sit well on my skin.
So, Maybelline has the "Shade Finder" on their website for this exact line.  I'd been struggling for a while to find the right shade and this one is definitely it! It's lightweight and breathable and doesn't clog my pores (I do use a primer beforehand) and blends well with cream contour.  I love it.
I am very fair complected and have the hardest time finding a drug store brand foundation that will match my light skin, this is a perfect match! It also leaves a beautiful dewey finish which is great if you have dry-normal skin. It blends like a dream and while it isn't super long lasting, It still stays on a good three-four hours with out fading. The coverage is light to medium, but is build-able. I would recommend this foundation to anyone who just wants a more flawless, airbrushed, natural look!
This is the first time I've been able to find any face product that is an exact match for my super fair skin. Also I have spots that are extremely dry and this doesn't look patchy at all. I have this on order for every couple months now. I have tried many expensive high end brands and nothing comes close.
Perfect for my extremely dry skin. Doesn't disappoint! Goes on smooth and blends well. Only wish there was a better bottle with maybe an applicator, gets a little messy to get the liquid ot sometimes.
I have dry skin so every other concealer would dry out my skin and just look plain ugly, this however moisturizes while concealing. I love it
Great foundation for fair skin with pink undertones, which is not easy to find. It’s a bit oilier, which is why I got it as I have dry skin. Though not at all sticky. I used with primer and it lasted all day. Really does seem like a high end foundation and not a drug store brand.
This was the perfect color for my face in regards to my makeup. It's an exact color, doesn't make my face too light or too dark, but just right. Thanks guys, you're the best!
Love this makeup! Had never tried it before, but will definitely be ordering again!
Bought for my sister. She uses it for awhile now. She loves it. Coverage and texture
Nothing I can say bad about this product ,great on so many levels, good to and for my skin easy to wash off,as well as easy to apply no streaks and stays on as well stays put love this product
I have tried other brands/kinds of foundation on and off, but I always come back to this. It covers well, but has a nice dewy finish that does not look cakey. It blends easily and doesn't cling to my dry patches. My concealer blends well with it also. Plus it's affordable and works just as good as some pricier foundations.
Holds up well to a long day at work. Feels light on my face without the heavy, cakey feel, yet covers beautifully.
I love the way this foundation feels and smells. I don't need to use a moisturizer under it. So many shades to choose from, too!
Maybe if you want very light coverage but seemed watered down,can’t get what I want out of this product at all my cc cream does a way better job than this. Also the color was darker than expected but thankfully read other reviews&went lighter which was still darker than expected. It’s too watered down for me&doesn’t cover anything,I’d rather get my drug store cc cream so much better than this.
I love this product, worth the price. Definitely recommend it 100 %, it covers very well and makes my make up look flawless.
This has nice coverage, but not as nice of coverage as the matte version of this. I like to have more dewy looking skin, so I would love to see a nice balance between this and the matte foundation. This particular color is what I usually use in other products, but was a little dark on my skin.
The best ever dewy foundation
Goes on so smooth. Lasts me all day. Perfect coverage
Very natural color. The texture is silky. I have relatively dry skin in winter, so I apply facial lotion before using this foundation. It helps the color to last longer too.
I really snout this foundation. My skin is too oily for the dewy finish so I gave it to my BFF and order the matte finish
I ordered shade 355 and I have to say that I'm happy with the color and pigmentation. It isn't terribly opaque so, it is easy to build the color from sheer to medium coverage. This foundation color is perfect for those with yellow undertones.When I first put it on, it was QUITE oily which was surprising seeing as I have dry skin. But, as the foundation sets and oxidizes it becomes truly dewy and not as "wet" as it was when I first put it on. I would definitely suggest wearing it with some loose powder on top because it's easily transferable.
I was expecting the liquid to match the stick foundation which I was running out of.  The liquid 120 is a bit darker and not as creamy as the stick.  In all other respects it is a good foundation, not too heavy or cakey and covers well without looking like you are wearing much.  Provided the color really does "Fit You".  I went to 110  instead and am more satisfied with the lighter color.
The dewy formula oxidizes much more than the matte formula, I loved the matte one of this and the lightest shade perfectly matched my pale skin, the dewy one is pretty but it’s more sheer and looks a little bit darker than the matte even though it’s the same shade. Also wears off later in the day but I didn’t set it.
Easy to apply, even. Long wearing. Dewy appearance. Picture perfect!!
I wasn't impressed. I wanted light coverage, but this was basically no coverage. I have dry skin and this makeup did nothing for me.
I ordered porcelain so I don’t understand why the product is so beige and orangey. In the picture it looks much lighter and accurate to the shade but in actuality it’s more of a tan color. I’m quite pale so it doesn’t work for my skin tone and am disappointed. Usually porcelain works. Got the foundation for my pictures and schoolyear but won’t get to wear it. The actual formula is nice enough though, and not drying, it’s just that the shades are way off target from their name.
I bought this in both the matte & dewy formulas. The matte came in the normal, correct, extremely pale shade. As someone who looks like they’ve never seen the sun, that’s what I was going for. Unfortunately I purchased two bottles of the dewy formula as well, and, though labeled 110 - were both deep shades of orange-tan. Not sure how quality assurance missed this one.
Maybeline cosmetics always comes through for me!  Fit Me Dewy - Smooth Foundation is not only the perfect color that adds just the right amount of natural blush to my complexion, but also gives my skin a natural, healthy, long lasting glow!  I will be buying this product over and over again!
This is by far my favorite foundation of all time! I have very dry skin and this works well for me! So smooth, smells amazing! Stays on for a long time, good coverage! Definitely will be buying more in the near future. Love it!
Had someone’s hair inside. Disgusting
I won't buy this again, It goes on a little more sheer than I prefer, it resembles more of a lightweight tinted moisturizer than a full coverage foundation.  It applies really smooth, and looks very dewy, which I love, but I guess I prefer a more full coverage foundation which I didnt even realize till I used this one.  When I put it on, it was darker than I expected but after going on vacation I got a little sun and its perfect now. I'm not worried about that, but what i DO hate is although it looks like I have foundation on when I apply it and look in the mirror,  EVERY SINGLE picture of me since wearing this , IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE NO MAKEUP ON!! I'm not talking, I look "natural" I'm talking, it looks like I just woke up and my face looks like crap.  I hate being wasteful so I've been making myself wear it, but it seems like its going to last forever so I think I just need to pitch it and find something else.  My usual foundation had been discontinued and I had high hopes for this one after seeing some review pics.  Sadly this is NOT it for me.
I have been trying various kinds of foundation and I think I finally found one I like. It covers well and lasts all day. I'm using the lightest shade, which actually matches well. This foundation won't break the bank and works better than the expensive brands I have been trying
fair on the skin
Beautiful. Glides on. Complete game changer for me!!! I found my go-to makeup!!!! No issues whatsoever!!
Would be perfect if it had a pump bottle.  I like the foundation.  But time consuming just to get it out of the bottle.  A pump would be great on these bottles
This is one of the best products for the money.  It stays on all day.  When I put it on I make sure to moisturize first.  After application I put setting powder on.  I'm 62 and pleased with the outcome.
I was expecting a little more coverage but I do like how it feels and lack of any smell to it.
I really like this product.  I normally use MAC within the same shade but whenever I am unable to get to a MAC Store then I use this as a substitution.  The foundation is light, goes on smoothly and provides a great coverage.  Depending upon how your day goes and the weather you may have to apply more than once (i.e. hot, windy) and can be used with a matte powder if needed to seal in the look.
It fits/matches absolutely well
I bought this because it was advertised as fragrance free. When I recieved it I believed it to be fragrance free and put it on my face and severe burning and stinging due to my fragrance allergies. When I read the ingredients it was not fragrance free at all. It listed frgrance  on the ingredient list. I should have read the ingredients before purchasing but why would I even have to question it when they described it as fragrance free. I dont know who is to blame for this  maybelline or amazon.  People buy fragrance free because they like myself may have fragrance allergies. This was false advertising. My face looks red  and blotchy and burns now. I will never purchase foundation from amazon ever again.
Report abuse
Product used to spread around face, it stays longer with setting spray.
Wrong shade,lighter than I thought.i will find someone to give both these new bottles too.or I will put it in my collection for the needy.
I absolutely love love love this product, first of all. I get 110 which is one of the few makeup products pale enough for me, I don't really have a yellow tint in my skin and this product lacks one. The confusion, however, comes from the fact that upon opening the package there was also an Air Heads candy thing in it (???) As if that wasn't strange enough in another package from another company that came in the mail today there was a Pip-squeaks crayola marker. I have no idea why, but I am happy with the product.
Maybelline has been my go to foundation since my early 20s.  She is full coverage and  matches my skin tone very well.
It covers well
Great foundation! I love the dewy finish even though I have oily skin. Adapts well to my skin and applies nicely. My new fav.
This has become my holy grail moisturizing foundation for my dry eczema-laden skin. Not only does this not dry me out, I actually found the perfect shade which is almost impossible for me considering I tend to fall in between shades. Love it!
This Is my absolute favorite drugstore foundation.
Not for hot weather. Looks greasy. But the colour is amazing for my skin texture.
Its so hard to find the right shade, but I've found it and sticking to it. It makes my skin look buttery smooth, and dewy without looking oily! Coverage is nice without feeling like 'm painting on a whole new face, and its breathable too. The spf works, as I can tell where I missed when I'm out n the sun too long. Beautiful product that blends super well!
Good
Easy to use
Quick and easy to use. It does not clog my pores. It does not clump up after hours of use. It is lightweight and still gives me great coverage. Highly recommend.
Looks great  on
All over coverage and it's not greasy and it's not too orange-based it's even got my skin tone covers up my blemishes love it.
Pretty good! Better than some of my previous foundations.
This foundation is my favorite drugstore foundation. it looks so smooth and dewy on the skin, it's not cakey or anything. Does a great job at covering my redness and blemishes. I just blend in it sometimes with a damp sponge but even without, it's so dewy. love it.
i really wanted to like this because it's the perfect color for my pale complexion... but i just can't, it has about a medium coverage at best so if you have anything other than an absolute perfect skin, you'll need to use lots of concealer. that's just a minor flaw though, the big thing is that it just looks terrible on the skin. it made my pores look HUGE, even with an expert brush and the right technique. it looks grainy and chalky when you're done but is extremely oily to the touch and soaks up any kind of finishing powder. it gets right up in every little line you have after about 2 minutes of wearing it and makes you look about 10 years older! so the color is a big yes, everything else is a big NO. i tried everything imaginable to make it work and i wear make up on a daily basis, but a bad product is a bad product and no technique in the world can fix that.
One of my favorite foundations. Last very long blends great very affordable. Its an all around win. Maybelline Fit Me foundation and Loreal 24 hour foundation are my two favorites.
I use this product in matte and usually in Porcelain...needless to say the Porcelain in this kind is COMPLETELY off.. it is SUPER dark/orange and no where near my shade. Tha nk goodness it was only 4 dollars...right in the trash
Unbelievable results for the price! No more will I spend $30 on foundation. Apply and blend with a good sponge. Concealer and creme blush blend perfectly.
I don't feel anything. and the color is difficult to choose.
I was very surprised at the soft coverage of this Maybelline foundation. It is very nice forthe price and does the same as some department store high price foundations.  Recommend itto  ladies with dry skin.
This is good stuff. By far the best foundation i have found for under $10.  Light but gives you full coverage.  The color was a little lighter than I thought it was going to be but I will know for next time. I would recommend to others.
This is a very good foundation if you have dry skin as it is more moist than many others, but not greasy. Coverage is good and the color was as shown in the picture. It does not cause any problems even on very sensitive skin. All in all considerably better than others I have tried.
I love this product. It blends really easy I don’t wear it every day but I do wear it sometimes and it doesn’t break out my skin and it washes off really easy but holds through my entire work shift. I love that it melts into my skin like it’s a lotion and not a foundation.
Love ❤️ my maybelline fit me foundation in coconut(355) , I normally use Kat Von D foundation, but I saw a tutorial on makeup on you tube with this foundation I went to Walgreens to try which shade suitable for my complexion and I was sold can beat the price comparing to $39. This foundation blends so natural to your skin to me last all day if apply primer first.
After years of frustration I have finally found a foundation that goes on smoothly, has good coverage and matches the color of my complexion. I have wasted so much  money on other products that invariably turned out to be a big disappointment and ended up in the trash. To find a product that works for me at such a reasonable price really makes my day.
I like it.  I do use a lotion after I wash my face which helps the foundation spread easier and more evenly.  I have pale skin, so I have to be careful to select a light shade of color. Thanks!
I usually buy this T my local drug store but price was great on amazon so I got it on here. My favorite by far does not make me sensitive skin break up, gives me a nice dewy look which I like. I like matte but personally I think it looks awful on drier skin and that's what I have. I love the dewy finish look at it last all day.
Although I bought 3 different shades...once because it came a little darker than expected and a 3rd for seasonal tan variation..BUT this is THEE most awesome product for the over 50 gals..it is WONDERFUL...no HINT of wearing a foundation AT ALL. It is a little more difficult to remove than traditional foundation..BUT WELL WORTH IT.
Very good foundation good color match easy to apply
SINCE MAIL NOT REGULATED WHEN IT COMES TO TEMPERATURE MY BOTTLE WAS HOT I TRIED IT AND IT HAD A GREEN UGLY OVERTONE SO MAYBE WAS DAMAGE BY HEAT SO I WONT BUY MAKEUP OR ANYTHING THAT IS HEAT SENSITIVE UNLESS IT COMES UPS OR FED EX THE MAILMAN SIT WITH IT IN THE SUN TILL END DAY NO GOOD
The shade on my phone looks different than what actually came. Very disappointed.
Has been my favorite foundation for years!!
I really like how light weight and easy to spread this is. I bought stuff that was more expensive and was suppose to be better coverage but it was so heavy it didn’t spread easy and actually made it look worse. This was a nice surprise.
Hi my name is Kim hall. I purchase maybelline fit me dewy. I put my light founation on first ,then put a little of the darker on and it lookd good. I realky like. It goes on real nice. I really dont have amy down fall on the product. I would recommend to friends. Thank you Kim Hall
Looks good on the skin
Disappointed.  Expected more.  Drying on my skin.  What are us baby boomers to do now that we are older?  Make up is catered to the young that have oily skin or combination skin.  There is a market out there for foundation for older women who no longer have acne and our skin is dry and we want to cover up uneven skinn tones now.  The make up market doesn't look at us as spending dollars.  Please, there are lots of older women begging for a sheer foundation that covers just enough and is moisturizing.  And is luminizing.  Reflects light.  Sheer tints don't work either.
Not full coverage
The tones are a little darker than pictured so I recommend buying a tone lighter than you normally use.IT works very good tho!
This foundation was all that I had hoped for. I was looking for a soft, light foundation that wouldn't make me look cakey or fake and this product blew me out of the water. The color wasn't overwhelming and the dewy finish made my skin look natural and flawless. It is light enough for everyday use and stays all day. Very satisfied and would recommend to anyone who wants a relatively cheap foundation that does the job well.
This is a very good drugstore foundation - price and color are excellent!
My favorite
The only issue I have with this product is that after using the foundation a few times, the opening and lid gets gunked up with the make-up. It then eventually starts to leak out of the bottle which leaves me not being able to store it in my make-up bag, but instead, upright on the shelf. Has great coverage.
It’s a really good and cheap foundation
Yes very sheer
This product worked really well for a month. Now my skin is dry and this foundation only makes it worst. It also has a strange smell to it which is really hard to describe. It was very easy to spread. Very runny. It does not clog pores, but like I said it has dried my face out and my face use to be really oily. So...I will be looking for a new product.
I thought I was only going to use this for my Harley Quinn cosplays, as I picked a very light shade, but as it turns out, this shade works great for my skin tone! It's easy to apply, doesn't take much product to cover my whole face, and doesn't feel thick or heavy on. This is such a great product for the price! An unexpected great find for daily wear!
Matte finish
My favorite foundation and got it for a good price.
I have dry skin and I’m absolutely in love with this foundation, it has a medium coverage and the finish is just so pretty
Wrong color  But I’ve the makeup.
New favorite!  For my dry skin it looks dewy and healthy.  Most foundations look caked, powdery, dry, and soo noticeable, but this foundation makes my skin look like skin!!!!  If you don't like the dewy look just put a powder on top and shine is gone without the caked look
Love the dewy look.  I had been using the matte but this dewy is more natural looking.  Going to order another bottle today!
I used it for the first time today. I love it! I needed a different shade because it's summer and this was the perfect one. I bought the nude beige and it was neither too light or too dark and looked very natural.
Great coverage for "drugstore" make-up. Lasted all day and I received a lot of compliments when I wear it.
Pros : Very light , very good coverage , gives a natural fresh look, blends in well , good for an everyday useCons : to some like myself it may be a bit on the oilier side so it will make you break out a bit , so if you had sensitive skin or very oily skin i wouldn't recommend it
Its pretty decent I prefer loriel pro glow but this is a deff close 2nd
Love that this foundation is not a Matt dry finish.  The dewy finish is perfect for my super dry skin and it’s the right amount of coverage.
Great product.  Long lasting.
The Fit Me line liquid makeup is a perfect match for my skin.  It goes on smooth and creamy and looks good throughout a long work day.  The only problem I have is the same number corresponding powder doesn't match at all, it is much lighter than the liquid color so it doesn't match my face.  They should try to match the liquid with the powder colors better.
Noticed the color is slightly off. Wanted to buy another stick of the same color but it was not available. Opted for the liquid foundation and it’s slightly off. When on my face is looks way too orange. Other than that great foundation but consistency with colors would be nice considering it’s basically useless for me now.
Have to say for under $5 this provides great coverage. No orange-y look. Doesnt dry out your skin. I will be buying it again.
I managed to pick my perfect shade. This is lovely since i usually have dry skin. It is moisturizing, lasts all day and I will absolutely be rebuying it.
Good coverage the only reason I did not give it five star is because I sweat around my mouth area and whenever I do that area always comes off and it said sweat proof
I switched from a BB cream to this makeup. It has light coverage but covers well and looks natural. Great price.
It's my go to foundations. I have been using it for two years. It works really well with a beauty sponge! It stays on all day And I love the price, too!
Blends well and feels light
I like that this foundation doesn't leave my skin cakey or heavy, it feels light when applied directly on the skin, blends well with my skin tone. Coverage is okay though you do have to layer it more than once if you have a blemish you need to cover up. After applying this foundation, I set it with my loose powder using a brush and it leaves my skin looking matte throughout the whole day.
If this looks to orange on me is maybe because I got the wrong shade!! Bommer...... other than that is full coverage
This product is just gorgeous! It blends in well, plus  it really does let my skin breath though and it leaves my skin with a dewy look. When it first arrived in the mail I thought that I had ordered the wrong shade but I was wrong it is the perfect consistency and is just perfect!! I love it I would advise everyone to buy it . BUT FIRST MAKE SURE THAT YOU GO TEH THE MAYBLINE FIT ME PAGE ON LINE AND USE THE SHADE FINDER TO FIND YOUR PERFECT SHADE!! Its fabulous. If you're considering buying it..YOU SHOULD!!
I don't like it that's too light I need the 3 shaped darker I don't like the product
won't recommend if you have dry skin it only makes it worse.
This settles into my pores and has no coverage on my skin surface. Looks absolutely horrible.
Not the best coverage but I like it. Doesn't last too long either. HOWEVER it is good for dry skin. Lots of foundations make it so you can really see how flaky my skin is, but not this stuff.
i am a first time user but this is literally my skin in a bottle ❤️❤️❤️
The most amazing fondation ..
This is great for dry skin, it moisturizes and leaves a dewy finish. I apply it like lotion.
The color i ordered was way off from what it looked like online. Much darker
I love it!
I have been using this foundation for about a year now. I love it. I only recently bought in on Amazon, because my local drug store where I usually buy it had been out the two times I went to buy it. It was cheaper on Amazon! Same product, long lasting and perfect color match. Highly recommend this Maybelline line.
Be carful of the mix getting in body hair.
AWESOME formula.  I've been using it for years, and I swear by it.  I've tried Lancome, Chanel, Bobbi Brown, all of it, and this is hands-down the smoothest medium coverage foundation I've ever found. Creamy and doesn't crease into your pores, plus the color blends very nicely.  Love it!
I bought Nude Beige 125 online, not knowing if the shade will match my skin tone.  It's a tad darker than my skin, but it's hydrating and it glides on easily using http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005TKZS76?keywords=eco%20tools&qid=1448362342&ref_=sr_1_29&sr=8-29, brushes.Coverage is light but it gives you a clean canvas needed for proper makeup.  If you're like me, and you wear foundation once in a blue moon, then this will do the job just fine.
I have very dull, dry, and red skin and finding a foundation that would cover my redness and not highlight my dull skin at the same time has been Impossible. I did some research and decided to try this foundation and it is amazing! The coverage is good and my skin looks smooth and lively. I pair it with the set and smooth powder.
It looks amazing when you first put the foundation on, moisturizing, and nude beige is my perfect match for skin tone. However, it starts separating badddd on the forehead, by the nose, and imperfections pop out within a couple hours of wearing this product, even after powder and setting spray. Disappointed in the longevity.
I like this foundation for my dry, 65 year old skin.  It was a little darker than it looked on the picture, which happens, but summer's here, it will soon be a perfect match.
I live up north where the climate is very cold and dry most of the year. This foundation for the price is awesome. I've bought another foundation brand for 10bucks and it dried out my already dry skin. Maybelline Fit Me Dewy is perfect for dry skin it makes for a flawless look and I love it.
Love it!
This makeup is a very good quality for the price. I have been using for about five years. Maybelline is a reliable product.
Very satisfied with purchase and product.
Great stuff !! Matches my skin perfectly
Great match
I'm an Indian woman with medium to fair complexion. I use the shade sandy beige and it works fine for me ( it is tad bit darker but I mix it with a tinted moisturizer lighter than my skin tone). As the name suggests, it provides a dewy finish without making the skin look oily. I set it with a pressed powder though. Best buy for a drugstore foundation so far.
This foundation doesn't leave your face feeling oily/cakey. The application is smooth, and it usually lasts all day.
Love this stuff. I’m old school not into the new makeup and I always get compliments
its a good cheap foundation. it doesnt oxidize that much so its pretty true to its color. i suggest sticking to the dewy and smooth, the matte version isnt good.
Product came unsealed, half full and greasy fingerprints all over the bottle! Wth how disgusting to sell USED makeup as new!
Love! Blends great, lasts all day. Not heavy or cakey, nice and smooth. I chose 128 which matched my skin tone perfectly
this reminds me of MAC prolongwear in a way.. great buildable coverage without any cakiness. i have dry skin and this is one of my holy grails. and for the price??? yess!!
this works pretty good,  i use it quite often, it doesn't cake or feel like im wearing a lot of makeup, so i do like it, i do mix up my makeup a lot and wear different things, and i do wear this one quit often. it blends well, and does not smudge easily, and stays on all day, without looking greasy or anything. i would recommend it!
I was looking for something that would match my skin so I bought this just by looking at the pictures and it’s the perfect shade! I wish I had a little more coverage, but it’s light and doesn’t clog my pores.
The foundation is extremely smooth and blends extremely well I definitely recommended the product to my mother.
Usually use covergirl queen collection golden honey Q25 foundation. This product is a contender and a close hue to queen collection. Although product is not full coverage but long lasting. Color/hue is exact match to my skin tone. I'm impressed!
Idk if it’s Bc I purchased on Amazon but this is my fav foundation bc it’s dewy and my skin is v dry and this one works great but idk this batch was drying and ugly
Was a little darker then I expected the matte shades actually look lighter then these. But has good covrage and a perfect dewy look. My favorite foundation.
This was purchased for my daughter. However, I use the same foundation in place of the higher end ones that I can no longer afford and this product works well. It is long-lasting and does not irritate my skin.
Good
I did a lot of research to find a good quality foundation for an affordable price. This product kept coming up so I got it, but I am not satisfied. Why do so many foundations have an orange tint?? I don't wear a lot of makeup so I'm going for a natural look, but it's impossible when my base shade makes me look like an oompa-loompa.
I love this foundation it goes on really well plus it blends with my skin tone well while also covering up the redness in my cheeks. I've been using it for 2 years now and just absolutely love it
For the price I was shocked by the quality. This formula is amazing. But it does not last all day without a setting powder. I use a setting spray in addition to it and it looks lovely all day.
I’m very pale, and 110 in dewy always matches my skin tone. The coverage/concealing isn’t the best, but this foundation has never made me break out and has been my go to for like 2 years running. I have combination skin and it leaves me neither dry or oily.
It may work for some but for me I just felt like it was dry after application. The colors, and I have bought quite a few of these since price was right, I didn't find a match for me and plus the feel wasn't right. I have seen other reviews say to mix to get perfect match but that seems alotta trouble and well, messy. It did seem to cake a bit in some areas even after moisture apply. This was not for me.
This was the first time I bought the Fit Me Dewy and was taking an additional chance trying it for the first time from Amazon. It is fantastic! It fit my skin tone perfectly and applies nicely. I already bought another one to keep over at my boyfriends house!
i love it, it gives a good coverage... although the effect doesnt last long but its okay
I love this foundation! I was a bit skeptical since I used Maybelline's color matcher online before ordering it from here well it did blend into my skin perfectly! I got 230. I used a makeup sponge to stipple it onto my skin and it left a silky and airbrushed look that lasted the whole night. (About 5 hours) I haven't used it yet for a full day but it is much lighter than their dream matte mousse foundation with the same flawless looking skin. It held up well with sweat and rain as well.
As described
Love the consistency and coverage. This foundation is medium to full coverage, and has a dewy finish. I do NOT recommend for oily or mixed skin though. Also I do wish it had a pump to control how much product you get but really it’s a great foundation
I like it because the normal to dry is good for my skin.  I also use a day cream under the makeup.
I hate this! It look so bad on me! Especially my cheeks that are the driest spots of my face. It make my face look like it had a lot of textures! It also just sat on top of my skin too…yea, it’s a no for me.
Great price
Great foundation
Excelente producto
Love this foundation! So lightweight and easy to blend !
I really like this because it has sunscreen. I mix it up with my morning moisturizer  or sometimes I use it like a foundation. It doesn't feel heavy on the skin, its not drying. I have dry skin.
I really like the foundation! but I got a shade that is darker than my skin tone. I went back to the store for lighter shade and it is a perfect match on my skin! So far, best matching foundation for me!
This foundation looks better on my older skin than some products costing 2 or 3 times more.  I am very happy with it.
I already reviewed this for another shade. This shade was way too dark for me. Make sure you go to the website and use their photo uploaded, and match your shade. Goes on light but good coverage.
This was perfect all around
Arrived without a seal. Darker than expected.
Too liquid & doesn’t stay long
This is the perfect foundation! I am so happy that I have found my holy grail product! My face goes from oily to dry to combo all the time and thisnflundation keeps up! Doesn’t leave my skin oily and all shiny looking! I put this one and hardly have to add concealer! I love it.
This is amazing for the price. Goes on easy and blends perfect. I use it with the matching powder. Lasts the whole day. Very slightly dries my skin by the end, but, I am not complaining. No creasing. Light to medium coverage.
Easy to spread
I love this foundation I use it every day and it is the one I get almost all the time. I love the 'dewy' look that it gives your skin, shiny but not greasy. It lasts all day as long as you don't touch your face too much
I'm on my second bottle of this foundation. I really like it a lot. Goes on smooth, feels good on my skin, lasts but washes off easily. I am on the pale side so I started with color #120, then I went to #125. Not much difference but I like it better.
It’s very nice for dry skin
Not quite my complexion. I used a moisturizer prior. It was still hard to distribute evenly. Definitely looks like I have foundation on. I don’t like that look. Prefer a natural look with little tiny bit of shine.
The shade is really pretty good. It oxidized, so my face ended up too dark, but it's the closest I've gotten to my neck color. The formula is what I expect for $6. There's lots of texture, and it deepened my laugh lines immediately. It also vanished pretty quickly. I might as well have bought the matte formula. Also, my bottle arrived with no safety seal. Why, Amazon? Why? Honestly, it's time to switch to Ulta, or some store. This is getting bad. Why can I never get intact packaging?
My God - all us ladies know that the shade porcelain is close to ghostly white!  That’s because I am extremely fair and need to blend porcelain with Fair ivory and a ivory. These shades were much much darker than the labels on all four (4) of the bottles I purchased. Such a disappointment!
Very nice
So this is my first time trying normal to dry because I was thinking have a dry face but NOPE it’s too light and I couldn’t find my shade
I love this. It can hide anything and looks natural if you put it on with a beauty blender. It dries quickly so work in sections. It doesn't feel heavy or smell much either so this has become part of my daily makeup routine. It's a good price too and you get a good amount.
This is the perfect everyday coverage. Perfect match for my skin. And doesn't feel heavy. Will not mess up clothes. Love it.
I like the Decy smooth - Fair Porcelain is for very light skin but works great in winter months. the coverage is great and did not cause any breakouts for me and I have sensitive skin.
I love this product! I was using an E.l.f. foundation, but it was making my dry skin look even more dry. I heard this product is great for dry skin, and it definitely is! My skin looks so smooth and illuminating with this foundation. I’m in love!
I have been using this product for about a year. It is light, not greasy, and covers for the entire day. I am a little pale since I try to stay out of the sun and have both red and yellow tints to my skin and this color really evens me out. It even stays on during a light workout. It is a must try.
(Mocha) it came as expected! arrived really early which i was happy with and literally the only con is that the foundation isn't pump, you have to pour that's the only reason i gave this a 4 star :) other wise, i'm very satisfied
It was a lot darker than I expected but I have an issue with matching my skin tone. I mixed it with a lighter foundation and it worked alright. I picked up the same product in my correct shade at the store and it worked great. It stayed on for a long period of time, through sweat and all. I would say that it is worth the purchase, but only if you intend on doing a full face of makeup, otherwise it doesn't look very natural.
My best foundation yet. Maybelline Fit Me surpasses the much more expensive foundations in smoothness and color.I was able to find my perfect shade in beige-buff and have bought an extra supply to have on hand.
I really like this foundation. It's a fair match to my skin, which is hard to find since I have an Irish complexion ;). I got the 110 Porcelain and it blends pretty well. It doesn't smell particularly good, but it's not too bad.
I bought this because I read that it was great for dry skin.  That's not exactly true.  I moisturize before I put it on and still have flaky spots.  It's a great shade for light skin.  I have blonde hair and green eyes and wear cool colors.
I'm not a person that wear foundation, not a big make up person. I like this foundation because it blends nicely with my complexion.
My favorite and great for dry skin
This foundation is kinda moisturizing. It doesn't self set, so I have to powder it, so it gets cakey. It breaks down on and around my nose.
I ordered this item because my wife uses this...I thought. I ordered the wrong type, but she was still happy with it. So, dodged a bullet with that. Note to guys: Let your significant other make the purchase. Some surprises don't work out, some do. I got lucky.
Wrong shade. Don't buy make up online unless you already know your exact shade match. 5 days past return window. Looked at all the info avail online on shades but still wrong. Looks orange. Also stays sticky feeling without a finishing powder.
The product was 3 or 4 shades darker than the picture, and dried out the skin. Why use a product made by a company that practices animal testing when the product is misleading and harmful to the skin anyways?
I've used this for years. I only apply it once in the morning but could probably use a touch-up during the day time. It's a nice color -- easy to apply. I just use my fingers and apply it as I would moisturizer -- it's the fastest and easiest way and still looks even. Love it though! Hope they never discontinue the color!
Nice for summer skin, but does need t-zone powdering for me. I do get oily but it doesn't breakup and go blotchy on me.
first foundation I'm ever using and I'm not disappointed. Not cakey at all and stays on the whole day. Good for winter seasons since it's super hydrating.
Best low-price foundation I've found. I have large pores and dry skin, and even with primer most foundations look kind of flaky on me. This one provides good coverage while looking smooth and soft, and stays all day when I use setting spray. I'm very impressed!
If you have very fair skin like I do, I would recommend buying a shade or two lighter than what you usually wear. I bought in the shade 110 porcelain which is the lightest i could find and it still was too dark for me with a slight orange tint.
I really like this foundation. I used to hate wearing foundation because my skin is not oily, so the matte-ness of most foundations just made my skin look terrible. I love the dewy look, it's much more subtle on me.
Have used this for many months! Summer and Winter ~ Covers well without streaking ~ Covers Brown spots too!
I got my summer shade isnted of my winter shade, but this is still a great product. The coverage is medium, but its super easy to apply and if you apply a primer and a setting powder/spray it will stay all day!
I have dry skin and it did nothing for me. No coverage at all.
I always buy expensive makeup and wanted something simple to wear throughout the day and not have to pay an arm and a leg. I am so impressed with this foundation, that it is now my GO TO foundation. It is perfect, light, clean coverage, again I am truly impressed!
ordered this product last night and it came in this afternoon, very dewy and I like it a lot. It almost compares to the Chanel brand as far as the dewiness and coverage.
Perfect coverage
I've used this foundation for quite awhile. It goes on well and doesn't take much. I also like that it also has SPF.
I pictured the bottle being a little bigger but the way I use make up this product only lasted me a week but if your not an heavy make up user like I am it could last you some time
I didn’t like it as much. Melts off your face so quickly.
Being very fair skinned, it is so hard to find a foundation that matches. I'm in the beauty industry. I've tried high end foundations for years and they always go a little bit to dark when they oxidize. This inexpensive foundation is the best match I've ever found. It has a nice light dewy finish. I've bought it over and over again.
Goes on super smooth and blends perfectly with my skin tone.
My wife loves it. Still has to set with powder but other than that 5 stars
I have dry skin and these feel more comfortable than other foundation...but all the Beige colors are little too yellowish
This product was very easy to apply and very lightweight I don't feel like it's too much on my face, very breathable and matched my skin and evened out my skin tone.
Nice foundation for the price, wish the coverage was a little heavier for dark spots, veins, etc.  Got some concealer.
Love this foundation!!! It covers very well. Goes on smooth and easy. Leaves a touch of glow to your skin.
I had tried the matt first but like the dewy better. It really leaves a nice smooth look on my face.
I like this product. I use it with the foundation brush I purchased. Great combo . fantastic coverage It does leave you feeling a little dewey but not horrible. I have very dry skin so it's not a problem for me. If you have oily skin I would not recommend this product.
I had an allergic reaction to this I don't know why, I use this brand regularly but I normally buy it from cvs not Amazon
As a mixed chic, I have on countless occasions found myself disappointed with a shade too dark or too light. I have fair skin that tends to get dry. Maybelline did the trick, perfect shade...dewy and soft results.
The perfect foundation. Matches my pale skin without making me look orange.
I love this foundation, it doesn't leave my face super oily even after 10+ hours of wear, and I can do as light or as heavy coverage as I want and it still looks awesome.
I was in WalGreens when I saw the "Fit Me" display. I walked away from it then I decided to go back. I tested it on my skin and it was a PERFECT MATCH!!!! I have been using all the expensive make-up brands because I thought that they would have the best foundation since they are so pricey. WRONG!!!! I am a true Maybelline fan now. I love this foundation. I have recommended it to all of my friends. I know they will love it too!!!!
Always been my favorite foundation! It can make me look oily but I just make sure I use a good setting powder and blot through the day. This foundation is very reasonably priced and a staple in my makeup collection
Too runny
Bought this and although it doesn't make me look like a dewy princess, it's still nice and natural finish, blends out into my skin and looks natural no cake face
For some reason I can’t check expiration date, it might be fake…
This product  is my favorite. I will not use any other product! It is so easy to apply and it evens out my inperfections.
I was using a powder foundation but thought it made my slight wrinkles look like canyons.  So I gave this a try along with the powder and concealer, along with a makeup sponge.  So please rly surprised and for a good price—
The color was a perfect match for my shin complexion.
Definitely don’t feel like it moisturized because I saw flaky skin after applying. I used a primer before applying so I was a bit disappointed that it didn’t go on very well. Feels like weight, but I’m not sure if that’s because it’s drying?
So smooth and lasts for hours! By far the best foundation and price as well. Love this!
Covers very well
This is now my go-to foundation because it has the right balance between sheer/natural and cover, makes touching up dark spots look more seamless when I start with this foundation. It blends perfectly with my skin tone and that could be luck but anyway it does and I like that. Doesn't look too tan or too pale. Good price too.
This product gave me chemical burns and it’s not even the right color. Smells like sunscreen and leaves skin greasy then burned off.
I am a makeup fan. I have owned and tried so many different foundations, high-end and drugstore (currently keeping no fewer than 30 bottles and tubes at home). I really wanted to love this Maybelline one, for many people have agreed that this was a truly great foundation.But it stings. It gave me the burning sensation that I have not ever experienced ever in my life. I don't know if it is the just the bottle I got, or it's the ingredient of this particular formula that doesn't suit me.I wonder how many people have the same experience, and also is there any other product out there does this to people?
Wonderful
I tried this side by side with my drugstore purchased version and it is not the same.
This matches my skin tone perfect and blends easily. It’s not too heavy, but it lasts most of the day.
I've bought this before. It's pretty awesome. My skin tone is a very light tan. It's hard for me to find a match for my skin because it's not light, medium or dark. If you're worried about this being a good color for you and you're between a darker light skin color and medium, you'll be fine with this. My friend is medium skin tone and she used it and loved it too. It's like the color just blends perfectly with your skin tone.
Love it. I only use it for my lace wigs though🤣 I do not wear make up but it actually still makes my lace match my skin tone.
Unfortunately it broke me out and I won’t be able to use it again. ( Has a perfume smell) but I liked how pretty it looked.
Im a bit spoiled on decently costly foundation, this stuff didn't quite live up to my high, and perhaps, unrealistic expectations for foundation. The coverage is thin and watery to me. If you want light coverage, this might be the foundation for you, though.
I like this foundation because it feels light with good coverage. I would highly recommend!
It is true to its name, and is smooth, applies well, and 'fits you'. Since your ordering online its hard to tell which tone to get but with this it provides good coverage even if it doesn't match your skin tone completely.
Didn’t like it, was too thick
I am soo happy with it perfectly suits my skin tone
I have dry skin and it does not cling to my dry patches. It does a pretty good job of covering my rosacea as well. Where it doesn't work is on my unsightly, large pores. My solution is to mix half of this with half of Fit Me Matte & Poreless and the two combined are perfection!
Little goes a long way. I have sensitive and very dry skin and this does the job.. light weight.. not cakey.
I got the fair ivory and it is really orange-y.  It is a far cry from anything “fair” or “ivory”.  I’ll never be able to use this and it is just not worth the trouble of returning.  Ugh.
Nice and smooth
Maybelline: Fit Me DewyDark circles under your eyes? Red skin? Dry skin? This stuff will cover it all up! It fills in those tough spots nicely and doesn't feel heavy or look unnatural at all. Wish I bought it sooner!
I love it a little darker then the ones in the store for sum reason but it blends in really well very happy
It can get ashy on me sometimes, but I've found a way to make it work. I use 355 coconut.
Covers well - can be built up.  I have dry skin but oily in the T-zone.  I set it in the T-zone with powder.  Lasts well through a 5 hour check up.  Will buy again.
Please remove your fragrance free headline.  It was NOT fragrance free! And pr6why several other reviews complained about rashes.  Guess what knowing a product is fragrance free is VERY important to some if us. Please be responsible sellers! Yes you may lose some sales but are least your reviews and your selling would be more honest.
One of my favorite foundations!
Ibought this product after purchasing the maybelline fit me 355 n coconut which was way too light and yellow and immensely  mattifying. I then bought the Maybelline dream velvet in 95 coconut which was also too dark and oxided horribly darker. i bought this product in 360 mocha with hopes that maybe it would be a match but alas it is way too dark  and it also oxidizes. I decided to mix the 355 and 360 together because evidently i am a shade in between however that also went horribly wrong as the 355 has a very yellow under tone and the 360 a red under tone do the result was comparable to the black opal hazel nut before it oxidizes  or the ridiculous new formula in the new Maybelline super matte line 356 [war coconut]. obviously this was not for me as this brand does not make my shade. i included a pictures below.
Loved this product came in quick would definitely order again.
Great product.  beware as you layer, it gets increasingly darker, even orangey.  Rids the face of heavy pours, covers blemishes, covers dark circles, leaves skin with a beautiful dewy look, not matted or shiny.  I don't always wear makeup but my skin always feels as if it were healthier the day after.  Absolutely addicted.
Love the shade and texture but after five hours it begins to break down/wear off.
I guess I shouldn't give this a negative since it is dewy.... But it really makes my face get very oily very quickly and is most definitely not for someone with even the slightest bit of oily skin.  I think it ends up making my skin look cakey rather than a light dew.
Item as described.  Exactly what I expected.  Will buy from again. Fast shipping.
It's great for people with dry skin. Blends well and if you want the matte look you can just bake and use matte setting spray.
I am using this foundation almost from 4 years. I try many other higher brands,drugs store foundation nothing work for me.Fit me give Dewy ,smooth, fresh and its blending so beautifully in my skin.
Tried it because I heard many many good things - everyone claims it's THE drug store foundation. I'm (unfortunately) accustomed to using high end foundations, but wanted to give more affordable alternatives a try. Color match was fine - I'm East Asian and got it in Sandy Beige. However, I was shocked that it could only go on smoothly with a makeup sponge. Also, there's no pump (?!). That might've been fine, but then I found that the foundation runs off my face halfway through the day, leaving it an obvious, patchy oily mess by the end of the day. A foundation that requires touchup? No thank you!
This was a pretty good pick. It is smooth and goes on nice. Make sure that you know which shade to pick! The wrong shade is the only way you can go wrong with this product.
Very easy to spread. Build able coverage. Matches my skin perfect
Like
I was so excited to try this product...but I'm kind of meh about it now. It definitely matches my skin tone very well, and seems to cover fairly well. Unfortunately, it's very oily, and after only 2 days of use it's made my sensitive skin break out. I tried using loose powder with it, but my face still feels oily. :(Definitely don't rely on the pictures from amazon....visit maybelline's website first and use their color matcher thing. I almost bought a shade that would have been way too dark for me.
I like how it blends in easily. And it feels like a light weight formula.
I have oily skin, super prone to breakouts, but this foundation never gave me a problem.The coverage is perfect. I use very little at daytime and just a bit more for night (you know, to avoid weird flash photos).It gives skin a dewy, natural look, so I definitely reccomend it.
I like It🤩🤩🤩
Great coverage
Maybelline Fit Me! products are the best products I've found that do not break the bank.  These products are also the closest I've found to matching my facial color and last - I would definitely recommend them!
Good foundation
A little darker than I expected but it seemed to blend well and is great, light weight coverage.
I bought this foundation by mistake, not realizing it's for normal to dry skin. I have oily and acne-prone skin, and this foundation works terribly for me because1. It is very difficult to spread out smoothly on my skin. I used a sponge applier which worked fine for other foundations but not this one.2. It doesn't cover my acne redness very well and also causes skin irritation.3. The color is way off than what I had expected.It might still work for normal to dry skin users as it had intended for. But for oily skin users, please be advised to stay away from it.
To me this goals net connect with some of the most expensive foundations, and oftentimes performs much better.
I've purchased this foundation, but have never tried it on. Unfortunately, it didn't look good with my type of skin, because it wasn't covering my red spots. I decided to give it to my friend, she has a flawless skin and she loved it and even asked me to buy her one more.
bought ivory. It has a pink tone and it's light to use.
The product experience is great and worth recommending!
Even though this was slightly (very slightly) lighter than my skin tone, it blended perfectly and it's great for anyone who's just starting to use foundation. I have dry skin and this is perfect! I use this with the fit me powder and concealer and I love how everything works out. This is a great product!
Favorite foundation so far! I have dry skin, and this isn't oily, but so nice to my skin.
Smaller than I had expected, easy to apply, inexpensiveDon’t not lasts long but it’s cute and drug store verified price
It’s runny and you can see every pore in my skin & it doesn’t cover up any redness in my skin
I normally don't like drugstore brand foundations, as I've found none of them have really worked well with my dry skin. I've had to go to high end brands to get the look I want-- But no more!! This foundation is just amazing. Not only does it match me perfectly, it is not at all drying to my skin. I am pleased to have found something for a reasonable price that gives me a flawless finish!
I ordered the buff beige, and it is darker that it looks.  When I first opened the package I was worried, but it blended very well and looked better that some of the more pricey products.  It is a little oily if you already have oily skin, but with powder it is just fine.
Absolutely love the feel and texture of this foundation. It is the perfect match for my skin so I definitely subscribe to automatically receive this product monthly. I highly recommend!!
Very smooth and sheer. Yet covers age spots.Also love 15 spf sunblock too
The only possible thing I can say is that this foundation is a bit runny and can be oily on skin which could cause breakouts.. For me it has worked pretty good as long as you wash your face at night to remove it. Makes a glow look to face.
This is one of my favorite products, not new to me so I am very satisfied.
Perfect for everyday look when you dont need the full coverage or no skin problems.It’s light, makes your skin glow and looks really healthy.
Doesn’t leave my skin oily and all shiny looking! I put this one and hardly have to add concealer! I love it.
Oh my this my best foundation ever. Little gives you enough coverage. I just apply ones and I am good to go. I am 360 mocha. Happy they have the Matte in 360, will try that and hope i don't get disappointed. Try this is just wonderful. Works better than some expensive ones
Exact color my daughter needed. Good matte finish, lasts all day
I just open my package and it's open and leaking. I will be returning it
Very good reasonably priced makeup for my mature skin!
This foundation is a great build able foundation. Easy to use. Can be a heavier type but it gets the job done!
I am in love with this concealer! It has easy application and does a great job covering up those under-eye circles. One thing I do have to say is that it is smaller than I expected, but I will definitely be ordering more in the future!
I don't know about you but when i tried this item and it was burning  my eyes made them watery all the time while i was using this item but after you put it on it gives you ok look.......
I use this on a regular doesn’t break out my skin.
I’m giving this a two because mainly I liked how they protected the foundation in shipping. Now it is so much darker than it looks on the phone and it does not match me at all because I am basically a pale white. This looked like their lightest shade. Oh boy was it not. Disappointed hope I can return, but probably can not.
The Fit me! is my go-to foundation.  So many shades and such good coverage.  I even bought several other of the FIT me items because I love this foundation so much.
Very nich
I've always had trouble finding foundations that are light enough but don't make me look ghostly. Originally in stores I bought the 120 but I found it was a touch too dark (I'm keeping it for summer months when I'm darker). I liked the coverage though so I went online and purchased this one (115) and it works perfectly. Note: I have very fair skin, freckles, blue veins are visible in my wrists among other places.
This make doesn’t bend easy and it leaves the face looking Cakey don’t recommend it
I love this foundation! I was using a more expensive foundation as I have dry sensitive skin. I was so happy to find the foundation gives you a dewy glow and doesn’t make my skin breakout.
The product it good but not what I was hoping for in relation to my skin. I 50 now and probably need anti aging makeup now. But this product is wonderful.
I have oily skin and I love this. It looks full coverage but natural. It lasts about 8 hours
This is how my product was delivered. I opened it up for it to be all spilled in the envelope and empty!!! What a waste of money. Will be requesting a refund!
This is my favorite foundation to use. And I love the price.
it applies to the face nice
I have very light skin and get super pink at the drop of a hat (seriously, one cocktail and l could lead Santa's sleigh).  This is a very cool tone that blends really nicely and doesn't feel heavy.  I don't like to spend too much on make up, and this seems like good quality at a bargain price.  And it matches my skin really well - l haven't found a cool tone this light elsewhere
My sister loved it and it is really hard for her to find colors that match her skin tone! She uses it with a fit me concealer and it all blends well! Good for people with skin on the dryer side!
First off I got the wrong shade so that's on me. (I got 355 coconut) However, this foundation is light coverage and is completely unbuildable. It's not bad to apply to the skin...it has a slight scent. This foundation leaves a nice dewy look on the skin at first...then after 10 minutes looks both cakey and greasy. I have dry skin and no matter what primer I use or don't use this never sinks into my skin and just starts to crease in the most unflattering places.
I was so upset when I went to get my 320 fit maybelline foundation and was told 320 was no more "discontinued".If I wanted I would have to use 315 or 330.A sales clerk from walmart suggested to look for it online and that what I did.I just got my order and so happy with everything, Thank you for making it possible and for such great service.I recommend this seller to all amazon clintele.`
It's the perfect shade!!
Im usually very picky with foundation and love this one. It is smooth but a little goes a far way which i love about this product.
I love this - I try other products but always come back to this.
it feels like it would be a good foundation but porcelain is way too dark to be porcelain
It was broken when they were delivered
I love how it feels, but the color oxides and is too pink for my warm skin.
Not full coverage and does not last all dat but I really like how my skin looks with this foundation
Love the colour  matches my skin stone and its smell good love the  way it not heavy  on my face makes  look  natural and look like am not wearing to much make-up 😊.
I thought this might be the foundation I was happy with. Not so. Although it is easily applied, it is very oily. Oily is not even a good description, it's more like greasy! I had to slather on oil absorbing powder after application of Fit just to dull the wet look. Oh well, the price is not too bad and I will keep searching for that perfect foundation.
It's a good foundation and doesn't have a pinkish tone to it. The only problem I have about this foundation is that when I put it on, I can always see the foundation streak or it looks dryish. I think it might be bc I'm using a brush to apply it and I might have to use a sponge, but overall it's alright bc it gives a really nice glowy appearance and covers most little scars and imperfections
I was a pretty big fan of the Maybelline Fit Me Matte but I needed some moisture on my face. I purchased this. It’s my new favorite!!! Will continue to buy.
I have been wanting to try new make foundation since I have big pores and this works great. I can see a difference when looking in the mirror since switching to Fit me foundation. It has not clogged my pores at all which I was concerned about. I haven't had a single breakout since switching.
One of my favorites!!!!
Love the color
This is not a “true” tone. Order a shade lighter than you normally would
First time trying it and it went beyond my expectations!! Highly recommend
I was to lazy to go out and buy this at the store but I love this foundation.
My favorite foundation.  I bought this and the matte and use both cause I have a half dry half oily face, I swear by them.
Its dewy and medium coverage.
I like that the foundation is easy to apply and that it last long for me.
Nice, I got it for myself but my 16 year old daughter takes it and uses it regularly
The best foundation I’ve tried and always matches my complexion perfectly, and can’t beat the price!
I've never used a Maybelline foundation, but my MAC finished and i need to buy one on a hurry, I saw a good reviews on this one and I gave it a try.It has a very natural finish, and last almost all day.I'll buy it again!
Great product wrong color for me
The foundation definitely isnt drying and can be used all over your face but no matter how much you put on a pimple it won’t cover it, it’s too thin. I kept trying to layer it over my makeup but had to get a tarte stick in addition to this because it’s just really light in coverage
Let me tell you, Love this make up! It does not rub off or look crappy.I looked for it at Wal-Mart when I ran out and I was shocked to see it on Amazon. So happy I could get my same one by scanning it and finding it here at Amazon. Matches the same I had before. No more waiting for Wal-Mart to have in stock!Thanks Amazon!
This is my usual brand but with a different finish. I usually use the matte version (same #) but in this finish the color seems too light without the pinkish tone I'm use to. Makes me look a bit washed out on its own.
Best Walmart type foundation out there in my opinion. Great coverage and long wear consistency. I would definitely reccomend this foundation over other drug store ones.
Spreads well, coverage ok, color wrong which was my fault
Great for dry skin! 110 has yellow undertones which is awesome as it's hard to find a drugstore foundation that is pale af with yellow undertones instead of pink.I'll buy again and again.
great foundation if you are on a budget but want a dreamy base. it look very "my skin but better" it has a radiance finish, medium coverage. it's amazing.
Light on the skin.
The overall feel of this makeup was tacky-ish.  I like to feel dry, this made me aware that I had a layer of cream on, kinda gross to me. The matte variety worked better for me.
The lid is cracked and it spilled out everywhere on my other items so o can’t use it I’m so disappointed with this product
In the picture that I had ordered from it was a lot lighter but it was pretty dark. The picture was just maybe a little misleading. But I will most likely just go get tan and it will match.
Perfect. Really smoothie. My new fave.
Color was true to what I ordered.
This product is amazing... I am very pale and it is always hard to find a foundation that won't make me look orange. This porcelain color matched my skin exactly! I didn't have to use extra powder to try to tone done the color or anything. It is also very light/thin on the skin but it also provides great coverage. I would recommend this product to anyone! It changes to match your skin!! Try it out!
Make up goes on smooth and covers well.  Not a heavy make up.
Love the fit me line! Great quality for the price...
Best foundation I've bought and at such a great price. Initially got this dewy and smooth and loved it but found the matte and poreless and it is amazing. All the pricey foundations are currently collecting dust. The colour is great for dark skin tones and blends easily.
Awesome foundation of you are dry but if ur oily I recommend the matte and pore less ... The only real con I could find was that it didn't have a pump(:(
Smooth,easy to apply
Good price not a good product will show wrinkle lines.
Matches my skin perfectly!!!
This is a part of my foundation collection for my clients and its pretty nice, a bit of a red/orangey undertone, but it last all night and I also use it on oily skin. pretty good.and yes its good for darker skin tones.
This is the best budget foundation out there. It is a perfect match for my brown skin. And the coverage is just perfect.For 6 $ I got 2 bottles, and gets delivered in 2 days. This is the best price you can get
I love how it covers dark spots and goes on smooth
Good quality product. For the price it works great
I love the way it feels. It delays like satin.
Its not suit for me
Pretty good and Im not a fan of maybeline products. However I feel it's a little heavy for the summer.
Best foundation ever tried and comparable to Dior airbrush finish. Use the brand website quiz to determine your color and you will be fine. I will no longer bounce around foundations. Wish it came in with a pump. I never have learned how to get foundation out of the pour type.
Perfect fit  my favorite so far , it requires just a little touch up because I don’t like too much foundation , still want it natural so I definitely recommend
Blends well and it doesn’t cake , very very smooth ! Good for the price
Great product and I also bought it and a few different shades
This is not a review of the makeup itself.  However, I was very disturbed that it arrived without a safety seal on the outside or inside of the container.  That's just not cool.  Did someone open it in the warehouse?
I've been using this foundation for years and it's perfect for every day wear. It provides moderate coverage and normally lasts for 4-6 hours with a primer and setting spray/powder (I have moderate oily skin).
This is the first time I found foundation that fits my needs
It's a little darker than my complexion however it does look nice.
Good
Very nice blend
Best best best! I’ve tried Armani, Dior, Estée Lauder, fenty foundations and this one definitely has my heart! Love it! My go to! Pls try it!
Color match was great ..... But it was kinda watery once dry did not relize I had anything on ....... Not sure how much I like it
I place this order for a friend that is a Professional make up artist, it is amazing the results you get once you know how to use it. I definitely recommend this product. Color is just perfect!Fast shipping and excellent customer service.
I ordered it because I had a gift card and it was actually the right color for my complexion. Great for when I don’t want to go matte
Love this makeup
Buy it!
I decided to purchase this after seeing many positive reviews for it on makeupalley. Im glad I did! It goes on smoothly, covers my freckles good and doesnt have a bad scent. I really like this foundation. Seems to last almost all day too.
It’s so hard to find quality foundation for very fair skin!
I love the product but I haven’t been on amazon for a while and Then I got a notice saying I had bought some foundation. But I didn’t.
I love Maybelline as a drugstore makeup choice and this is one reason why.  It lasts all day, doesn't dry or cake.  Good medium coverage.  Will buy again.
The foundation’s lid was loosened during shipping and it arrived with a pool of foundation all over. The product itself broke down pretty quickly and ended up looking very textured during the day. Would not recommend.
It is good! I love it. And it is so cheap too.
This product description on line says it is fragrance free. But on the actual bottle it lists fragrance as an ingredient. Do not buy if you have fragrance allergy.
Maybelline is my brand❤️❤️❤️
I really like this product.  I've been looking for a winter foundation when my skin is more dry.  This fit the bill.  Works well, covers well, and the color matched my skin tone. I'd buy again.
I just love the look. My skin looks smooth and young.
It is a good product. It did go on a little oily, but the nature of the product is not an oil based product, it's just kind of shiny at first.
Product blends in well
I give five star product "Maybelline New York Fit Me! Foundation, 110 Porcelain, SPF 18, 1 Fluid Ounce" because the product is needed to tone my white skin, besides having SPF 18 which is important to me.My package arrived complete and in excellent condifionesWas worth the wait because it is what I needed,  I'm sure I'll share again.
This is as good, better than some,  as several high priced foundations I have used in the past.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Color is so accurate. Love it. Doesn’t leave to glossy or too matte. Just perfect
I wore it all day! I work with kids. It lasted the entire day
Great product but be careful because the shade was way darker than it appeared.
i have a dry skin. and this produce is good for dry skin
Couldnt even use it this picture is very misleading you think toffee would be " dark skin" when i received it, it was more of a walnut color. Why im so generous with this review i gave it to my sister and she loved it. i would say know your color before you purchase because these pics does no justice.
Perfect color
I wasnt sure what to expect from the price, but I am impressed! It's good coverage & blends nicely! I plan on purchasing more!
Fit me line is the best. I'm color 220 and it feels nice.. it has a yellow undertone. I also have dry skin so the dewy foundation works great. It's like a medium coverage but I'm sure you can build up.
It's ok.... I probably would like it better if I had gotten a darker shade, the shade I choose was to pale!
PROS:- Almost a full coverage foundation- In the ranks of the high end foundations- Feels very natural on the skinCONS:- Makeup consistency is runny- Dries too quick- It wears off after about 6-8 hrs.
**Edit**This arrived completely busted open. All of the liquid foundation was out of the container and smeared all over the inside of the box. I told amazon about it coming broken and they shipped me another one right away! It arrived in perfect condition and didn't cost me any extra! I changed my review and my rating from 1 star to 5.
Made me look tanned, smelled ok tho.
It works really great 🥰
xcellent ... Affordable..
Good
Another  awesome purchase  the stores  have taken this  maybelline  fit me # 320  off  the shelves for  some reason  so I  saw that Amazon was selling  it  .  Someone  I know told me  I look vibrant  this  fit my natural skin color.
This was requested as a gift.  The recipient was very pleased with it.
Great product and FAST shipping!
I'm darker skinned. About a NW 45 in Mac makeup and I use this as both a normal foundation and I contour and highlight with this. Its not heavy and it doesn't break me out even though I have hella oily and sensitive skin. K sweat a lot as well living in south florida but this stuff treats my skin well.
Purchased a while ago and still have so much left. Makes my skin look and feel great
I like it
I like how smooth & easy this goes on. It does not settle into lines and does not accentuate pores. Need a good pressed powder to set this as it seems to be a moisturizing foundation. I've tried a lot of drugstore foundations & enjoy this one a lot. After continued use, I find it important to use a pressed powder as it will look greasy after a while.
Not the first time using it! I love it
I’ve used other expensive foundations, Fenty,MAC, etc... Was not expecting for this one to be perfect for my very dry skin type
My first time using it and it works pretty well. Its a very good buildable foundation.
Let me first say that I LOVE Maybelline products.  I was really excited to finally try this particular shade of FIT ME foundation because I love the other FIT ME products so much.  I wasn't at all pleased with the way that my makeup arrived.  There was absolutely no safety seal on the makeup. I ordered this and it came opened so I sent it back for a replacement and that one again came with no safety seal on the bottle.  I can't use makeup that has already been opened.  I'll just have to find a better deal elsewhere.
Product color was perfect but unfortunately no good for my combo skin  came out looking oily but kept it to mix in with my regular foundation for nights out does give a dewy look! Happy with the product would buy a different type next time!
If you have a yellow tone in your skin but are of Indian origin with lighter skin this will work well. It's my go to foundation! Goes on very smoothly and provides excellent coverage.
Came with two bottles but one was broken. It is a great product though. I just sent it back and they sent me new unbroken ones.
It’s a great product but not for oily skin.
Worth the price
Not only did it NOT have a seal , it’s not the original foundation like the one in the picture. I was hoping for the original foundation. Having no seal on it is very unsafe and unsanitary to me. Trash since I can not returned it
This color was too dark for me, but otherwise really good foundation
Product is great! Lasts long as well!
I have been wearing makeup since I was 14. I have had the expensive and the cheap. This product is not something I recommend. It seems very watery, when shaked first, the foundation was still very oily in appearance, and looked so on my face too. Color also was not a good choice, but this is always something you have to be cautious about when ordering makeup online (or even at the store!) With makeup it's hard to tell until you put it on if the color will be a match or not. I didn't like this, it didn't feel or look natural, felt and looked like I had heavy makeup on.
Extremely happy with this foundation.  I have dry skin and it leaves my face dewy and soft.  Great quality for the price.
This is a great foundation! It blends well and the coverage is great. I would buy it again!
Maybe it’s maybellineLove it
Looks and feels great!
Excellent product. Lies on the skin nicely and blends out easily. For the price I would highly recommend. Have tried the 110 (porcelain) and 115 (fair), which are fairly interchangeable with fair have a slightly more pinkish hue to it.
This shade was FAR too dark and orange and I ordered the lightest porcelain. I've used this before and it was light and neutral undertone. This is so orangy and dark I cannot use it. It's going in the trash. Thank goodness it was only $4 something. I just don't think it's real. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure it was a return. Under the lid was goopy. Showing picture of another Maybelline foundation in same color.
I have sensitive skin, plus I'm 71 and my face is somewhat dry. This product is terrific! I slather on moiturizer, let it set, and apply foundation with a cosmetics wedge (:although using your fingers or a brush works out just as well!). Excellent coverage.
This product is very oily and turned orange upon apply it and way too oily /the wrong color. Would not repurchase in the future. I really love Maybeline  products and I wanted to like it. But was returned
Love this product  gies on well and stays on
Not great for everyday wear. Makes me sweat while I'm at work
Good Foundation. I have very dry skin. It works good to my skin. And I think this foundation works better than high price foundation.
This product was great and exactly what was described, a great price and fast shipping. Unfortunately it was much darker than I expected! However great product and had I known the right one to match my skin,the product it would have been perfect!
Love this foundation! Works great for my skin type!
My favorite foundation. Beats any other for me!
I love the fact that it came in time as stated. It is the same color shade which I picked.I only disliked the fact that the bottle was not sealed.Great product quality & covering!
This stuff is great it makes my skin super-soft! It's almost as good as my makeup forever from Sephora!
Was a little too dark for my skin but at least I'll know that for next time
JUST OK...GOOD FOR SIMPLE COVERAGE
It was to red
I loved it!! By far my favorite ever
I use a beauty blender and this product goes on much nicer and cleaner looking than the matte foundation.  Will definitely be buying this again.
Perfect color!
I absolutely hate foundation.  It feels like I have a film on my face.  I finally found a foundation that I can't feel at all.  This stuff works great and covers up blemishes.  Definitely recommended.
It’s smooth and gives sufficient coverage for everyday use.
Really like this product!  I was using the other kind for so long but have dry skin always and this works beautifully.
Loved this product! It's so high and so affordable..would definitely reccomend it.
Fav drugstore foundation for everyday natural look
I love the Fit Me foundation. It is easy to apply, has a smooth finish, doesn't clog my pores, and lasts all day. I prefer this foundation over some high end brands.
Been using this foundation for years!
I love this foundation! Perfect shade and goes perfect for my dry skin. I got many compliments and it looks great! Thank you maybelline!
I liked this product. It is Dewey but I need Dewey.  Color was right on. Stayed on all day. When I took of off my skin was smooth.
I'm 51, this makeup looks the best on me
It makes my skin really smooth is not drying so is good for dry skin
Its best for my skin type
in what world is this classic ivory?? i swatched it and put it on my face and it’s brown/orange. will be returning. 😡 don’t order if you are pale! “classic ivory” the lightest shade is very tan!!
I absolutely love this concealer! It blends well and absolutely leaves that dewy look.
Love buying this on Amazon instead of in store where it's a little more. Just make sure you know your skin tone.
A lot of porcelain and ivory shades in other brands are quite dark for really pale people, like myself.. I searched for the perfect product and stumbled upon this product about 3 years ago and I can't imagine not having it. I love that it is decently priced and I honestly cannot say enough good things about this product
This blended right into my skin and fit my complexion. It does seem to wear off during the work day. Price is right though.
Perfect for dry skin. For my combo skin it left a nice medium coverage with a dewey finish. I used both the beautyjunkees flat top kabuki and sephora foundation brush with a comparable outcome.
What my woman uses and wanted, worth it.
love it. makes my skin look flawless
This “porcelain” is extremely dark and very orange. Terrible. It’s also wayyyyyy darker than the porcelain in the matte and poreless version. Both are shade 110.
LOVE the color and finish but isnt a "stay" product so oily girls will have to check every 2 hours or so. Again, keep that Mally compact handy and try different primers.
Just what I was looking for.
I really like the dewy smoothness of this foundation. It's very light and not full coverage but that's what I wanted for everyday use.
Good coverage, lightweight, gives skin a dewy look
Love it! Just buy the right shade.
Works good and is cheap.
This might have been okay if I had gotten the right color.  The 210 Sandy Beige has quite a yellow tint imo.  I need a more pinkish hue for my skin color.  It had to go back.  Just be careful before ordering and maybe check other sites for info on color before ordering on here.
This foundation is much pinker and several shades darker than the picture shows.It’s so off that I can’t even mix it with other products to save it.
I've used so many products. But this is the best of them all.
Love it. Light weight and my exact color
Color not as dark as pictured but the makeup is lovely.
Not real maybelline. Idk if they added something else to the bottle or what but it doesn’t look anything like my bottle I already had. Is much lighter then the shade I have which should be identical to the one I ordered. But the label was not on correctly either and it just doesn’t apply or look the same. Wouldn’t buy my foundation from this seller again lol
One of my favorite foundations
Wonderful - love this makeup - and a great deal! Two for one!!
Pros: light light medium coverageCons: too sheer like a bb creamOilyToo pinkyRegular matte Fit me is wayyyyy better.  I will buy the regular next time.Also the shipping was an arm and leg.I will just walk to my nearby walmart next time. Oh well.
easy to apply and quick dry, loved it.
Works great overall, love it!
Product came damaged in undamaged shipping box.
Its a bit oily but works good, add powder or a bronzer and it sticks!
the color does not look like in the picture.  It came 3 times darker . Very disappointing
New York Fit Me is one of my wife's favorite makeup lines. We decided to switch to amazon to purchase her makeup. This foundation has always been her favorite and causes no irritations. She applies it once in the morning and has no complaints!
The color is just right for me; a good foundation with light to medium coverage.  Our local WalMart never seems to have it in stock so it is good to find it on Amazon.
I like this product.  I've used it for years with good results.  Colour 120 matches my skin well.  This is easy to apply.  It does require touch up later in the day, but so do all the others too.
I love this foundation. The consistency is perfect. No bad smell. Doesn't feel heavy. Good coverage.  A little pink for my skin but I can make it work with some setting powder. My go-to everyday foundation.
Bottle came unsealed in any way. It’s so sheer that I might as well wear nothing. It doesn’t even out anything. At least it wasn’t heavy and gross. I’ve never needed foundation before you I wouldn’t be used to feelingIt. I might try one shade darker but I would trust it more if I purchased from a store.
doesn't blend on my face well and is flaky
Amazing, I got 230 and it matches my skin color perfectly plus it came 3 days after ordering it. I love it I love it I loveee it. Probably gonna order again !
good coverage, dries fast
I have been using this foundation ever since I started even wearing makeup because of the price. I love it and it's usually my go-to if I wanna look good for any occasion. :)
Goes on easy and smooth , does not settle like a lot of cheap coverage
I'm very disappointed that this item came without a tamper proof seal! I remember buying this at the store at one point and it had a seal? Anyway, I tried the product and I got a terrible allergic reaction. See picture and you will see. It caused all these red bumps on my face which is not normal. I've used it before but it was a few years ago? Maybe I got a defective product? It looked good when I applied it, so I didn't think anything of it. After a few hours of wear though, I took it off and found all these nasty red bumps! I'm sad that this happened.
Pretty decent foundation, came out lighter than I expected but I was blindly buying on the internet without first testing it.
Fit Me is just that, it fits my complexion so well, it's like my skin.  Find your color and the fit is on.  I will be buying this foundation again.

Been using this foundation for a long time tried them all the high end branded foundation but nope..... keep coming back to this Maybelline Fit Me is the Sh#T!!! And package came sooner than expected and also undamaged keep up no complains here
Beautiful product
Easy to apply, lasted a while, but not through the day ( I did not use any primer, so maybe that makes a difference) Overall nice product.
Wow! This is the best foundation I have ever used! I threw out my very expensive ones. Useless compared to this! I have told all my friends and they are now in love just like me.
I have very dry skin and this gives me coverage without drying out my skin
it has makeup smeared on the outside of the lid, and about half of the actual product is missing.
Great buy
Love this foundation. Full coverage that lasts all day. And this price is great!!! Almost half off drugstore prices.
a very nice liquid foundation that provides medium to full coverage, beautiful finish and lasts all day.the only Con I have for this product is that it takes a lot longer to dry or set which makes me think twice before using it in a typical busy morning.
The shade is not the same as the one I bought at the drug store, yet it's called the same.  No good.
I just wish for what you pay there was more in it.
Beautiful formula but the color is way off. The picture looks almost coco but in person it really your medium light. I ended up giving to my sister that's honey brown skin tone.
Great product.  Was suggested by a friend and glad I got it.
This is a very good makeup, HOWEVER, I purchased it before I needed it because it was at a discounted price.  Last weekend I was packing and noticed that my current Fit makeup was almost empty so I grabbed the 'new' Fit makeup I purchased from Amazon.  When I got to my weekend destination and opened the bottle IT HAD BEEN PREVOIUSLY USED, GROSS.  The lid and glass bottle grooves was covered with dried makeup, the color was even altered, possibly due to it being old and used.  It's too late for me to return the used makeup ….so buyer beware!!
to get full coverage you may have to apply several coats
This is a great price for a great foundation. Just wish i would have ordered a lighter shade.
Love this product. It’s my makeup of choice now.
I don't like it it feels greasy to wear
It smelled really bad, as if it was old and or fake.
118 light beige is too pink and too dark for me. Photo swatch appears very different. I will try mixing it with something else.
Maybelline a wonderful job on this make up I have combination skin and it covered and made my skin look flawless 😍 thanks Amazon/Maybelline
I just love this foundation period!!
Great as alwae.. Have been rebuying this for a while now, great shade, great application.
Like the way it looks on, but I need to get a lighter shade
Great product . For the price it does as it shall good product .
This foundation is great! Doesnt feel cakey after a long day at work and blends perfect.
Thats perfect match for my skin
Exact match to skin tone.
This is my favorite foundation! It’s a great price for a really good foundation.
I loved everything about it. It was the perfect shade that really fit me. I gave it four stars because I received it unsealed @@
Perfect for my skin which is a mix between oily and dry
GreasyColor darker than depictedLittle coverage
Translate review to English
Love.love.love. it's such a good product, it matches my skin perfectly
Great price and great foundationMedium coveredSmells goodFeel creamy
My go to foundation that is at a reasonable cost. The only thing is the final finish is very oily looking so I usually have to use a powder to clean it up.
I'm very satisfied with product, ordered 3 times
looks more orangy in person but has good coverage
Translate review to English
It was what I wanted.
I wish it could be thicker and more coverage
It doesnt last long at all but not drying and matches well.
Great. My skin is easily irritated so I typically need hypoallergenic products; this doesn't cause any reactions.
1 shade darker than photo
I just got open unsealed foundation, it feels like I got water added foundation,very disappointed.
I like this product it blended really well with my complexion.
I like to use the Dewy shades in winter when my skin is dry and the Matte shades in summer when my skin is oily. I love FIT me!
was open when i received  very messy  i though it away
I love it because it’s really buildable and really covering and I just love it
its great. sometimes its hard to get it to set
The shade, saturation and coverage are just what they are advertised to be. Great product for the price.
This provides great coverage for the price.
Loved it! makes my complexion more even. It is a little lighter than I expected it to be but the formula is great!
Love this stuff.
Really like this product. My skin looks brighter and it feels light on my face, which I like.
Full coverage and blends easy. I just need a lighter shade.
My daughter loves this product I have this on subscription service for her
Amazing application, it didn't come damage or anything . Totally gonna buy this a second time .
One of the few foundations I keep coming back to, because it matches my skin and blends in SO well. I never have to worry about it looking obvious that I'm wearing foundation, but I also never have to worry about it not covering where it counts.
I purchased this for my daughter.  She is pleased with the coverage she gets with this smooth foundation.  It is a good color for her.
My favorite formula out of all of their products! Not too dewy but also great coverage!
I always use this foundation because it covers lightly and blends perfectly. When you order-make sure the shade is lighter than you want-I received a shade more suited for my summer-tan.
good coverage
Love it it fit me easy to apply
Got the wrong color otherwise I think I might have liked it better
Great cover up!! Even nice tone. moisturizing!!
color is OK, but not easy to apply.
All I can say, is if you're over 50, pass on this one.  It's very drying, emphasizes pores & wrinkles, & broke apart (even with Primer over my dry skin) after 4 hours!  On an up note:  after trying nearly every drugstore brand, looking for an Affordable HOLY GRAIL, (since they discontinued Revlon Colorstay Whipped - my holy grail), I think I found one!  MISHA BB CREAM SPF 45, right here on Amazon! It's $7.00 ladies!  It feels high-end, like the Clarins & Chanel I used to wear, before my budget shrunk due to retirement.
Great everyday foundation
was as expected
Love this foundation but my skin is oily and tends to rub off easily I try and powered it often during summer
Great makeup. Blends really well and matches skin great. Doesn't leave face greasy and doesn't leave too much of a shine. I recommend this product to everyone looking to try a new foundation.
I’ve purchased this product at stores before & noticed a completely negative difference with the amazon ordered quality. It’s really watered down, smells like baby powder, & I noticed it was giving me blemishes where I had applied it. I would recommend just going to the store to purchase this. Overall not the same makeup experience I’ve had with these prior.
Noice.
This is a really great foundation cream. Apply with a brush by dabbing on once you apply to your skin with your finger. Works great over a concealer. I recommend this if you are looking for a good foundation cream. I will probably stay with this one from now on.
Goes on easily w/ a sponge. Covers nicely, although it is oily looking once applied, but using the matching powder brushed over- makes the finish matte- very nice!  Covers nicely all day. And this foundation is low on the toxic side, according to Skin Deep Cosmetic Database.
Dewy and good coverage
I actually really like this cover up. It does have fairly strong scent that I don’t care for.
The foundation has nice fluidity & goes on evenly.
Easily my favorite foundation. It's the closest thing I can find to MAC foundation at a fraction of the price. The finish is soft as powder with a lovely coverage without feeling Casey or dry. Blends beautifully for an even finish
I have a bit of dry skin and this didn’t make me dry.
Cheap and I love it better than what I was using!
This is the best drug store foundation. It's one of the best full coverage foundation and I really like it. This foundation covers all my acne scars. I highly recommend it and I will purchase
Its next to natural and gives a seamless flawless look..
it's so great and fits my skin tone perfectly, it goes on evenly and gives me full coverage, goes patchy at the end of the day though :)
Finally I found a shade of foundation that matches my skin! Love it.
I love is just a little lither than i expected.
Great coverage ! One of my favorites .
It’s very smooth & not to thick which is perfect
I prefer a dewy finish, so this is outstanding!
I prefer this Fit Me foundation to the matte one. It is much less drying and feels pretty weightless
Its difficult to be a return customer when there’s no consistency in the product. I ordered the same shade in the same finish and received something completely different. I’m a very fair redhead. I can’t use something that looks like artificial tanner.
This is very nice, the coverage & color are good.  I am now 50 so I worry about emphasizing wrinkles.  This looks good, makes my face appear 15 years younger.
Love this foundation does not make my face look cakey
I really love this foundation it complements yours skin and its not cakie it gives your skin a glow
This is supposedly classic ivory. I think not! It is even darker in person. It was not sealed when it came, so who knows what I really have.
Fit me is my fav I hope they make it for a very long time.
I am so fickle when it comes to foundation, but I really love this stuff.It doesn't leave my skin greasy and it provides great coverage. Love the SPF.About my skin: Late 20s. Fair with lots of rosy tones. Combination skin with oily t-zone and dry everywhere else.
Everything was good minus the color! I got shade 120 classic ivory because that’s the shade I always get in maybelline fit me products and this foundation was WAY darker than usual
Love this foundation, goes on smooth, has good coverage and is a great price!
good drug store foundation, use for my everyday wear
It was darker than I thought it would be especially since I ordered "Ivory". It also dries quickly so you have to spread quickly. Other than that Its a good foundation and especially for the price!
The matte Porcelain and the dewy Porcelain are two totally different colors. I normally get the matte but the matte was going to take another week to come in. Thinking like any other brand the color regardless of sheen is the same. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case here. Very disappointed in the inconsistency of their color pallet
This foundation is ok, but it's really thin almost like tinted moisturizer. Not for those who are looking for medium or full coverage! The Classic Ivory Color (120) is a little darker and pinkish than what I usually get as a very fair, pale complexion. But it'll probally work fine for summer.
Great product!!!
Love this lightweight foundation. Provides dewy look with medium coverage
The foundation is OK.  It is a little darker then expected, and mine came looking like a little had been used (was not full).  Did not provide as much coverage as I would have hoped.
Goes on great and just the right thickness to hide slight imperfections without looking caky.
Love this product.
I wasn’t impressed with this foundation. I thought it would be awesome after reading all of the positive reviews. It’s very greasy/oily. Doesn’t blend all that well. It sits in the fine lines and wrinkles. Doesn’t stay put. Started rubbing off immediately. Not the right color tones for very fair skin.
Absolutely love it!
I have used it only once so far but I'm in love with it so far. Since I wasn't able to determine my shade just by looking at pictures I went to the pharmacy to check my tone. I chose the Perfect color. Very happy.
Sits ok, a little thick for my liking but not full coverage, that weird kind of in between. Colour is not as light as I would have liked but is the lightest that it comes in.
A nice product overall
It's just alittle too oily.... Maybe it's just my skin idk
I love this! Goes on easy and does not look like I have on makeup - evens out my complexion and covers minor blemishes.Wonderful product.
Like others,  or pretty much everyone has said, the color is horrible. I even went a few shades lighter to try to get close to a match but ivory ended up being pumpkin orange. Don’t bother. Just pay the extra $3 to get it at a store so you don’t end up with the wrong color.
This order was for my wife, I suppose it is ok since she has not complained though
It’s a bit oily but I will purchase again
I love this brand of foundation.
This foundation doesn’t have very good coverage, it’s a very think formula. It’s also just looks flaky and cakes on my  dry skin. It’s also not very easy to blend. It might be alright if you are looking for little coverage and have normal to oily skin.
This "fit" matte foundation is absolutely the best I've ever used. It goes on so smith and lasts all day. Thank you to that seller.
Works okay but makes my skin look oily and makes me break out more.
it was open and it spilled all over
This product made the skin around my nose look drier than usual, wasn’t smooth looking at all. Was hopeful of this product due to the reviews but it didn’t work well for me.
Does not spread easily if you can get it out of the bottle.  I don’t recommend or buy again.
This foundation really blends well and doesn't settle in creases I use it every day and it is my favorite liquid foundation I have had in a while. :)
It did not come with an applicater and was the wrong shade. very disappointed.
I LOVE this product. It's actually a tad bit dark for me (complexion of Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child), but I mix it with BB Cream the medium color and it matches my skin perfectly!
Little disappointed. I thought coverage would be better.
I'm used to using brand name cosmetics, but this wasn't bad
Love it
I love this foundation! It goes on smoothly and doesn't look cakey but gives you full coverage to hide blemishes. Bye bye Mac.
Excelente Producto. Gracias.
Anything by maybeline is great. Delivery was good and packaging was good.
I usually use Matte and poreless. I thought I would try the Dewy and smooth. I received HALF OF A BOTTLE. I am so angry that I got screwed over. I have a pump that I put in my bottles that don't have pumps. When I opened up the bottle to add the pump, half the damned bottle was already gone. I sure as hell didn't pay half price.  I don't know if it was Maybelline or the seller but I won't be buying from either one, again. I'll stick to my NYX.
The color is fine and it blended well, but the oily feeling it gave me was not good at all.  I felt like my face was greasy the whole time I wore it and couldn't wait to get it off.  I am used to using bare minerals, but have also tried the Mary Kay Timewise foundation and definitely liked the Mary Kay better.  Maybe I should have gone for the Matte rather than dewy and smooth.
I like this product
Good
Great color and makeup.
Was okay - wouldn't order again, tho.
The shades with an odd number are really warm. This one is too orange for me. The finish looks nice on my skin, other than the color.
My favorite go to foundation, great coverage, great feel
NO real complaints
Do not buy it it’s not the same as a the store brought item I broke out in major hives !!!!
I have no complaints about this makeup
BETTER THAN SOME MORE EXPENSIVE BRANDS ...WILL BUY AGAIN
This is the only foundation i will use. It has good coverage and does not leave my face feeling oily at all. I get the color 330 and it blends with my skin perfectly and you can barely tell that i am wearing makeup.
Good product.
Absolutely in love with this foundation. It's my new go-to when before it was the Loreal Pro-Glow.
Don’t buy
Great
love this foundation matches my skin and blends easy
My favorite foundation. Blends well with dark skin tones
Matches skin color well.
She didn't like the product was runny
There is nothing I dislike about this product.
I really like this foundation - good match for my skin tone - doesn't make me face look like it's painted on.  Will purchase again.
works with my skin tone
Not greasy, but also not flaky. Natural looking. Good range of colors. Good medium coverage. I used to use a high-end department store brand for years that was discontinued  and I must say, I like this better, and for a third of the price.
Genuine product
👍
So far so good,I love it
Great product with good setting powder
O-M-G i loveeeee it will definitely buy again
I have very light skin (red hair) and thought Classic Ivory would be right for me but it is way dark for my complexion.  Very disappointed.
Love it
I love this makeup. It stays on, wears well, flawless finish! I love it!
Really a nice foundation. Smooth and great coverage. Barely feels like I’m wearing any makeup at all!
I swear by this foundation. It is the only foundation I have found that does not seem to turn my pale skin a frightening shade of orange a few hors after applying. I would recommend this product to anyone who has fair skin like myself.
Great value.
The foundation works beautifully but online it look much lighter than it is I am a medium leaning toward the darker so this honey beige color should fit. It doesn't; it's way too dark for my skin. I'm disappointed because I can not use it. :(
The coverage on this was just about non existent. Waste of money.
Too light for my complexion I will give to my daughter to see if it will work for her.
I've been using this product for years. I hope Maybelline stays with this formula! It's perfect!
great to cover my age dots
A little too light for my complexion, however I mixed it with my other foundation and it worked just lovely.
Long lasting and applies evenly w/ beauty blender.
Wasn’t the best coverage
I'm fair with pink undertones. I use 120 and it is perfect for blending with my skin color while diguising the pink/red when my cheeks get very flushed. Decided to order online since my local pharmacy always runs out of 120!
This shade suits me perfectly. It has a nice medium coverage. Its a bit shiney after application, but i can fix it with some powder. Its not the best for summer though but i will deffinetly use it during winter when my skin is much drier.
Love it
Good product. Exactly as described.
I love this foundation. Light but covers and evens skin tone. I bought some Laura Mercier stuff for a million dollars and use it if I'm desperate and it's the only thing I can find. Prefer this over heavier coverage foundations.
This foundation from Maybelline is a little bit oily and I would like it to last more. But it's still good stuff.
Love
good coverage...
Love this stuff and I love the price even more
Like it
I have dry skin, which this makeup was supposed to work well for.  Instead, it created thousands of tiny white flecks on my face, none of which could be seen before using it!  It looked truly awful. My unadorned skin looks a lot better!  I will have to discard it. It did have one positive quality: I have very fair skin, and the color match was good...but that didn't make up for the white flecks, which I guess were showing up every pore.
This is really nice to have especially in the winter makes your skin look alive and I'm here for it
I have dry skin and acne. And this is awesome for my flakey skin! Ive looked and looked, tried everything to make my skin look good and here is the answer.
Love it went in smooth all Day Coverage I fell Asleep in my makeup still looked good I Love It !! I will buy it again
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
I really liked this at first but after a few weeks of wearing my face started breaking out. Seemed to not protect my skin enough from my work environment I’ve never had breakouts and have worked the same place for 15 years until starting to wear this.
I really like to love this but it just not enough. If you are looking for a full coverage then this is NOT for you. I bought the MATTE one and that is way better than this DEWY type. I keep on reapplying but it just wont cover that much. Also, the first time I spread it, I felt blah and not amazed. Then, it took me hours before I experienced the “DEWY” effect on my face. This is not just for me. I’ll stick with the Matte type.
Obsessed with this foundation
Perfect
I love this foundation, it keeps my skin feeling moisturized all day. Super easy to blend and use!
My favorite cheaper foundation.
Love this makeup. Blends well and feels light on the skin.
Good foundation but I gave it 4 stars because its not suitable for oily or combination skin types
I always used the fit me matte pore less but live up north and having dry skin I switched and glad I did,
Luckily I can mix this one with my darker foundation and I can create my perfect match!
Let me tell you this foundation is really... difficult. At first I tried it out and HATED it, i thought it has no coverage and my face looked greasie as hell. And then saw a video of a makeup artist loving it.....--You have to use a sponge, not a brush, not your fingers cause it will look awfull.Good for dry-normal skin.VERY light coverage, almost like you are not wearing foundation at all.And the color Pure Beige makes my face look red-pink looking... ew
Arrived very early and I love the inexpensive price I paid for the makeup. If I buy in store it's more expensive. HAPPY SHOPPER!
it doesn't have a pump so it is a little messy to pour. blends in alright.
Nothing
I like, the color is perfect for latin yellow skin, looks natural.
Nice coverage and right shade
Stays on a long time with a primer
I love this foundation - I can easily put it on quickly before work and I can reapply as needed but I usually don't need to.
Not very dewy but more satin finish.
Goes on smooth. Lasts all day.
Good
Color is fine but I find myself using more setting powder as it is overly "dewy". Not my favorite foundation.
It doesn’t have alcoholGreat but other than that there is nothing to loveIt’s way too dark for a light version but I would not buy another shadeIt SOOO oily!!!! Face is like a shining one as if I applied some oil on it !!! Very runny . Bad choice
This product ended up making me break out, and hurt my skin. It wasn't the right consistency as other Maybelline foundations I've used before. But Amazon was AMAZING and refunded me, no Hassel at all! It could have just been a defective bottle.
Don't understand why Mabelline discontinued this color, fits me perfect, none of the other FIT ME shades look as good and have not found another brand that blends with my skin tone like 320, bring it back PLEASE!!
Soft natural look
The only problem I have with this makeup is that it makes my face feel really oily.
was cakey on your skin.
Fabulous
use when my baby was in dance it worked real well
i like it
Very good
this product does get oily, but it gives great coverage, and i mix it (the 110) with manic panic virgin white for goth makeup and works great. just make sure you use a powder like elfs color corrector and its the best product ever!
It’s good makeup just wasn’t my shade.
The color was a lot darker than the one in the store. i got the lightest shade and it was too dark compared to the one I bought from the store.
Smaller than I thought, but that's my fault for not paying attention to the size! It's my favorite foundation though, I've been using it for a while now. ☺️
I'm a pale girl. And this stuff looks pretty chalky on me. It's also giving me some skin issues. I have to make sure to get it completely off my skin, which is a little difficult with just cetaphil as a wash. I use it sparingly, when I have to have a foundation--I don't generally like wearing foundation anyway--but I'd prefer to avoid it. I wish I could find something that wasn't so "ick" for when I need to have a foundation on...que sera.
Thus product isn't the same quality as the one is buy at CVS or one of those. This is very thin and runny! Will be asking to return it!
Hands down my favorite foundation.
i bought it when i was in USi took it as a gift to my sister it is very good and the price so cheapin my country its for 25$i advise you to buy ,, Dont think :)
love it, matches pefect
Best foundation I have bought
Love the way it’s smooth .
✅
Perfect
Fit me does Fit me, great coverage and easy to apply.
great product came in fast it's a really great definitely would buy again
I'm happy with this Maybelline product, I love the coverage you get.  It does have a bit of a shine and I like to wear a little powder over it, and or mix it with moisterizer if I want lighter coverage.
I really like this shade and it really works well with my skin and skin type.
I ordered this online, since my local stores don't carry the lightest shade. 110 is a perfect match for my albaster skin =) Gives a medium coverage. Appears to last all day, and feels light on the skin; this hasn't made me breakout.
Did the shade test on the Maybelline page, but even then, "Pure beige" was too dark for my skin!
I love it
I like this foundation, it's very light coverage.  You really should see the colors at a store before ordering online.
Good product. Good pigment. Doesn’tast long.
I am not happy that this comes to you without a factory seal.  In my opinion, that is a problem.  I don’t buy cosmetics without a safety seal.
I have really dry skin so I never can find a foundation that match my skin and don't make it dryer. I didn't wear this much because it didn't match my skin
Good foundation l have had better would not buy again
Great color!!!

Is it real
My daughter thought this foundation shade would be just right for her. Make up always makes a good gift for the daughters. They like to try new things, it is good to find things that don't cost an arm and a leg.
Perfect
I have very sensitive skin and breakout with anything I put on my face. This stuff applies really well with a brush applicator and does not harm my skin. I never breakout or get any irritation.
Product description states that this is fragrance-free, but it is not as shown in the listed ingredients. I returned, since I have rosacea prone sensitive skin & cannot use.
Exactly what I wanted, fast shipping n all
I love it
Happy with it !

My face
Goes on smooth and doesn't rub off.
This product has made my face look so natural and fresh and has blended perfect with my skin tone and I just feel so confident and good about how i look now. I defiantly look forward to buying it again in the future.
love it
First time I was able to buy a foundation online that actually matches my complexion. Very pleased with this product.
Considering how inexpensive it is, it works great and matches well.
Just the right shade.  Very smooth.
It is pretty good, but not for oily skin or a very hot weather! It is very liquid also, so you have to be very carefull when using it. Also, doesn't last that long and melts really easy.

In love with this foundation. This was my second purchase from Amazon for the same product, and continue to buy as long as they're available here.
Although I did my homework on this, it ended up being bad quality and very water quality. Not worth my buy.
Even though this is a good product it doesn't have enough colors, it's still too dark for me
very good
considering the price that you're paying, it's definitely a great product.
This is my favourite drug store brand liquid foundation. It may just because I found a brand that matches my skin tone nicely.. but it isn't too thick or thin, not too greasy, and a nice medium coverage.
Arrived cracked
its a perfect shade dupe for mac nc42
This foundation is pretty oily.  I have to use a powder over it otherwise my face shines like crazy.  This foundation also rubs off easily so I find myself having to reapply throughout the day.
The make up has the right combination of moisture and thickness. Skin needs to be properly exfoliated, as usual. I am lucky to have found the right color......they better not disco it!!

Honestly this is such an under rated foundation. Lightweight, medium coverage, buildable, your skin but better, cost effective, lasts for ages. There is genuinely nothing to not love about this foundation. I'd rate it over my top shelf foundation any day of the week
This foundation is one of my top 5 foundations that I like to use, it has a nice consistency which smooths over and blends nicely with my skin leaving a lovely natural finish. It has good coverage and does a pretty good job at concealing my pores and imperfections. It doesn't leave my skin all oily by lunchtime like alot of other foundations do. The only downside to this foundation I found is it doesn't last all day, by early afternoon I'm needing to apply more.
"Helps my pores, great colour match and blends so well.
It's very good and an awesome price point.
I use the matte formula in winter.
A flawless  match."
This foundation oxidised on me after about 2-3 hours, and also came off a lot from my nose and chin. To start with however the finish & coverage was good and it looked natural.
So I've used this foundation on and off for a few years now. While I do appreciate the price, I wouldnt say it's really "poreless". I noticed around my nose it actually exaggerated my pores a lot, and the matte effect was quite drying so i would definitely recommend this foundation more if you have skin thats on the oilier side. One thing I do love about it is that it has a great shade range and is one of the only cheaper foundations that makes a shade pale enough for me, so thats fabulous. It also has great coverage and is super buildable and blendable, it's okay on my skin when paired with a hydrating primer. therefore i would use it again but i do not recommend this product for gals with dry skin, it'll make you look crusty.
Hands down the most reliable and best drug store foundation in town. Used this foundation on and off and i keep on coming back to Maybelline fit me. The coverage is perfect, I barely need to use concealer yet the foundation is not at all cakey! little goes a long way and a bottle lasts me long too. Love love love!
This is my favorite drug store foundation I've ever tried have repurchased this foundation so many times over the years a++++
LOVE! Can't rave about this foundation enough. Super easy to apply and at such a great value too! I'm not a makeup guru so using this product doesn't leave me with the guilty feeling of overusing it. Gives my skin great coverage but not a cakey look at all and I haven't had any issues with an oily appearance even over long periods of wearing.
I love to use this foundation during the day when I dont want a heavy full coverage feeling on my face, lasts great during the day and light weight.
"Didn't like it at all and I have oily skin. 
It may be because my skin is a little drier then usual in winter? I will keep it for summer though and see how it goes on then,hopefully it glides on easier. It made my skin look very dry and dried fast when trying to blend in. Colour matches and the coverage are really good though."
Matte everything is the big trend at the moment, and a matte foundation is the perfect thing for us oily skinned ladies. This product certainly reduces the appearance of pores and provides great coverage, however I find that it refuses to stay put on my face no matter what primer and setting spray I use. It moves around on your face a lot and slides off very easily. So overall I'd say it's a fairly average product that looks good when first applied but certainly won't stay looking that way all day.
I had heard that this particular matte foundation wasn't that great (just through friends ands friends of friends), but because I love matte foundation and have tried a few that have been suggested to me and They have failed,I decided to try this one,and omg I LOVE this, it's so good on my skin and it doesn't irritate me either. It's not cakey and I wore it for a few hours one day without setting spray and it was still fine when I got home :) I find it blends really well also. It is pricier then some I've used but it's my #1 foundation at the moment :)
This foundation is my first try of Maybelline. Maybellines one of those brands you can easily online or at most chain stores. When they launched this new line last year I was interested to see what this would be like. I purchased this in a bulk lot from Trade me because I like bargain hunting. Typically in New Zealand foundations can be priced medium to high range. Theres always other ways to try and find foundations and at an affordable rate like at Red Bucket sales etc. My skin type is dry combination with large pores. I get acne every time I try a new foundation or skincare product. Thankfully not with this one.
I have dry skin, always have, but I was having no luck with foundations that were targeted at dry skin. Whilst in Hawaii early last year I saw this, it was cheap as chips so I thought I'd take the plunge and try something that's the polar opposite of what I normally go for. Boy am I glad I did!
I am quite pale and ivory was too dark for me in this range, it sat really badly on my skin, pooling in areas and looking cakey.  I was quite disappointed as I had heard so many great things about this, with me it's either hit or miss and this was definately a miss.
I have recently learned from a BR pro lovely that my skin is not dry and sensitive like I previously was told.  It's combination and can be quite oily in the T Zone area.  I previously used the Fit Me dewy finish because I thought the shining dewy look was better for my dry skin.  But little did I know that although in places it looked good in the oily areas it made it even oilier.
I wear this at night when I go out, its cheap enough and does the job. My friend let me use hers one time and I just had to go out and get it as well as the  smooth and dewy foundation for during the day :) Great range of colours and blends in nicely.
I have very visible pores but Im not a big fan of silicone primers. I dont even need to use a primer with this. One of my favourites so far it keeps me matte all day,covers up my pores and has pretty good coverage. The price is good considering what you get. I'd repurchase again definitely!
After reading all the fuss about the original Fit Me foundation, I decided to give the matte and pore-less version a try. And I love it! I love the medium-full coverage, I love the way it sits on my skin and bigger pores, and I love how it covers my acne.The only thing is the colour choice with Maybelline is hit or miss when it comes to their lighter shade, I feel I'm in between Ivory and Classic Ivory.
i used to wear the original fit me and then tried the matte+pore one and it went matte far to quickly i didn't get a chance to apply it to my skin properly and it went all patchy. then i tried a friends one a few days later and it dried after i have applied it to my skin and smoothed it out?
I can't get enough of this foundation. I'm on my third bottle! It's so easy to blend out with buildable, medium coverage. It stays matte long enough for every day and is fairly affordable too. I took one lippie off for not having a pump on the bottle - if other Maybelline foundations have pumps why not this one?
I initially was not the biggest fan of this foundation. I at first found that this didnt sit right on my skin, and highlighted my large pores. After some experimentation however this foundation has certainly grown on me. I find that you need a well hydrated base, and a good pore filling primer. With these steps in place this foundation then provides a really pretty matte medium/full coverage, which I find lasts all day without looking cakey or shiny.
I really like this foundation, however I'm between colours which is really annoying. It also would be better if it had a pump bottle. It gives a buildable coverage and is matte but not too matte. Lasts pretty well and doesn't get too oily on me.
I love love love this foundation. I have tried so many different foundations that promise you perfection but this one doesn't lie. It matches perfectly too. Will definitely be buying this again.
I bought this foundation at one of the makeup sales as I had been looking at it for a while and wanted a cheap everyday foundation. I found the colours for lighter skinned ladies are either too grey or too pink. I went for the more grey option as my skin is already quite pink but it still wasn't quite the right colour (maybe I need to try a different colour). I found the coverage was medium which is good for everyday wear for me but I would choose a more high coverage foundation for the weekend. It is a fairly matte formula but I still use a light powder as my skin can be quite oily towards the end of the day. I will mix with another foundation to use the bottle but probably wouldn't purchase again.
I picked this up a few months ago as I was curious with the matte formula. I've tried the original Fit Me foundation years ago and although I liked it then, it wasn't the best for my oily skin.
"if you wanted Emily today's video is
gonna be to review all in Milan I'm
gonna be wearing half of my face to
Mabley foundations so on the website I'm
gonna be wearing the cool favorite at
fit me matte and poreless foundation I
love this foundation because it's light
medium coverage it looks like skin on
your skin it's great if you have oily
skin if you have dry skin I would mix it
with the other ones they have deep do me
one definitely recommend mixing these
together with your great is the combo
even if you have oily skin which I do
have so love this one highly recommended
it's like very very popular for a good
reason but you just came out with this
foundation this is the super state full
coverage foundation and this one has
more coverage and it's a little bit
different and I wanted to wear both of
these on half off my face all day long
so you can see them in action because
it's always great to hear a review but
it's even better if you can see it in
person so I'm gonna be applying both of
these with Beauty blenders basically I
just personally like using sponges
because it gives you the most natural
finish if you want more coverage you can
always lose a brush so on my right to
your left I'm going to be applying the
fit me foundation the colors I have like
my summer shades so they will be a bit
dark for me but we're just gonna blend
that until my neck and pretend
everything is okay
should have zoomed you in but you'll see
the final result
can Nestle seed align the middle of my
face but you can see I did have a couple
of like redness and it covered
everything pretty well you can still see
beauty marks so it's not like full full
coverage but it covered everything that
I really wanted to cover but if I had
like a breakout or something I could
just use concealer wherever I need it
but everything else still looks like
skin that's why I absolutely love it
probably why everyone seems to love it
and it's great it kind of has eight like
Demi matte finish I will be setting it
with powder just because it's what I
usually do it and want to make sure that
my own skin
doesn't make the test result just effect
immediately so on my other face but half
of my face I've been buying this one I
try to go and get to color that was the
closest to it but spoiler alert it does
oxidize so this one will be at first
lighter and hopefully it will be so my
close to it once it oxidized I just
wanted to mention by the way the
packaging they're very similar but are
we so so happy that they came out with a
pump like this should have had a pub
like I wish hopefully they will add a
pump to this foundation because it's so
great but it's such a to just try
and pour it on your head and then put it
on my face so I really appreciate that
they finally added a pump I will be
doing it close-up so you can see
difference in texture of foundations so
the newest full-coverage one is thicker
almost like a a little bit moosie
consistency and me fit me is definitely
a lot more liquidy so we're gonna try in
a cover I do have a little bit of
redness and a few breakouts so we'll see
the coverage but yes again warning at
first it's gonna be way lighter I didn't
mention definitely I have this shade at
125 and in this one I have the shade 120
I'm gonna add a swatch on my hands so I
can wait a few minutes and then swatch
it again so we can see how much oxidize
and how the color compare once they are
oxidized so I can show you that how the
colors compare and i will be swatching
this one to you but this one doesn't
oxidize so not a problem here so I'm
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to
show you but basically I like that the
coverage of this one is more natural
they fit me actually I should hold them
to the foundation as I'm talking about
it so this side has a little less
coverage but it also looks very very
natural I don't feel like it emphasizes
my pores as much but I do have two eye
patches around my nose it's the winter
so my skin will tend to have dry patches
around my nose and I do think that this
is emphasizing it which is why I
personally recommend to always mix it
with the other version I feel like it
makes the like perfect foundation
because this one doesn't emphasize three
patches whatsoever so if you have dry
skin definitely recommend it but this
one I do like it except around my nose
the super stay at full coverage
foundation definitely has more coverage
and I don't feel like this emphasizes
the dry patches around my nose as much
however I do think it emphasizes the
pores a little bit more right here where
they tend to beep I mean most humans
tend to have them right however I do you
think you can easily fix that by
applying either a pore primer or even
just when I find my powder in a second
you'll see they does tend to help lower
them a little bit more but if you don't
like to use powder in general I just
thought I would throw it up there so so
personally I think there's some positive
and negatives about both of these
personally I kind of find a solution
pretty easily especially whenever it's
something is so affordable I tend to try
and just find a easy fix that makes them
worth it so for this one for example
like I said just the poor primers and
powder you're good to go
and this one which is the reason I only
have my summer shade I tend to use this
during the summer because it does help
control the oils and during the summer I
don't have two eye patches so I don't
have to deal with it during the winter I
just usually mix it with this one which
is why this one is like super light I
have the shade 110 so I either reuse
this on its own or mix them together and
I feel like it makes it perfect combo
that doesn't emphasize the dry patches
so other than that you can see the
coverage is really good on my forehead
it's not perfect but I usually don't
tend to go for like super full coverage
on a daily basis so I think these are
perfect for that it covered mostly
everything you can see you can see a
little bit of redness on this side to
fit anyone does it have as
coverage button on the forehead it's
still pretty good you can see by the way
that the colors are pretty much matching
now in my face because it has oxidized
all my hand is gonna take a little
longer because it's a little thicker but
so if you were wondering if you have 125
120 will match you once it's oxidized so
okay so I did do the rest of my makeup
there's actually oil coming so if you
like that I like coming but I wanted to
show you what the foundations look like
with the powder and everything on top so
I'm gonna zoom you and kind of like I
have mentioned I don't think the powder
changes the fact that it doesn't besides
dry patches the pores are pretty much
you know normal to gone looking and this
side I do feel like the pores are a
little less visible once you powder but
I mean we all have pores right so I
don't really blame the foundation and
again like I said using a pore primer if
you are really looking to a poreless
look can definitely fix that issue and I
don't feel like it emphasizes my dry
patches as much now the foundation you
can see it's fully oxidized now so I'm
gonna apply it you like fresh swatch
next to it so you can see how much it
does oxidize it yeah so you can see it
is pretty oranjee compared to the shade
it was but if you keep that in mind I
don't think it's DUP difficult to find
your shade and I'm gonna swatch the
other one next to it just so you can see
cuz I do think that 125 looks pretty
close to 120 of the full coverage once
it's socialized so you can see it's good
in the middle I guess although the
foundation is quite thick there I don't
feel like on my face there's a
difference between the two right now so
so I'm gonna go on with my day and I
will be updating you probably once
before the energy day is currently 10
o'clock in the morning so I will be
wearing this for at least 10 hours and I
wanted to mention that I do have really
oily skin although during the winter
it's not as bad but around like five or
six hours it's usually when I have to
retouch the powder and everything so I
will be doing that I hope be doing that
on camera whenever I feel the need to so
it's nothing like the foundation are not
responsible for that it's definitely
just me having very oily skin in general
but again I will update you to zoom ins
and everything and keep you updated so
you know how I said I would come back in
like five six hours touch it up that
didn't happen
because I do not need to I don't know if
it's because it's winter my skin hasn't
been as oily it's legit than ten hours
it's like eight o'clock at night and I'm
just starting to feel shiny and seeing
some changes there's a reason this is a
Holy Grail foundation and why I've been
like dying to talk about this one
they're just really great I do however I
want to say that since I didn't touch up
the powder whatsoever and I'm starting
to boil II I've noticed that this side
is a little more cakey into my pores
which again makes sense as I did notice
that from the beginning the dry patches
are the same it hasn't become more
drying and I do feel like I'm a little
bit more oily on this side than this one
so hopefully you can see it but I feel
you can see my Porter a little bit more
on this side than this one and I do you
feel like I'm a little bit more oily
that's definitely harder to see but it's
just how I feel right now so really I
love both fun they shouldn't do both
favorites I do think they have like you
know their pros and cons but I wanted to
try and reapply I don't have any paper
to remove the oil so I'm just gonna use
toilet paper classy I'm just gonna try
to remove some oil and just see / show
you how they perform
after being reapplied because it's
always nice to see that the foundation
doesn't become cake you and your reply
but I can't already know but I just want
to show you so I'm gonna be here
applying some this batter on top so for
the pores after applying I feel like
this one is definitely a less visible
this one a little bit more and I've
noticed now I don't know if if I've been
touching my face that definitely happens
but I feel like this side might be a
little bit more uneven like little bits
that might have like separated and moved
around a little bit more than this side
I said this one is still perfectly even
personally I'm finding I'm keeping on
wearing at both of these foundations I
think they're really fantastic do real
affordable I think they're really great
if you want something that is a little
bit more lightweight a little bit less
coverage but doesn't emphasize the pores
whatsoever this one if you want
something with a little bit more
coverage and even if you have dry skin
maybe just moisturize probably
beforehand but I would also give this
one a shot usually full
race relations and Dreskin don't go well
together but I think this one would be
totally worth the shot you might want to
touch up the powder a little sooner with
this one so it doesn't become a little
patchy but I mean I've been wearing it
for 10 hours like if it lasts in hours I
don't complain so that's guys I hope you

BeautywithEmilyFox Depends on my skin at the time but Wet n wild photofocus and Loreal true match have to be my favorite!
L’Oréal Pro Matte. If it’s too drying or during winter I mix it with some Mac F+B.
The superstay
BeautywithEmilyFox the Maybelline superstay has quickly become my Holy Grail I just hate that it oxidizes so bad I went down to Shades and by the end of the day I&#39;m about 10 Shades Darker LOL. What is on your eyes? I love the color!!
BeautywithEmilyFox and I&#39;m on my second bottle already since its came out I&#39;ve had it for 2 months. Yes I do Full Beat of makeup every single day even though I&#39;m a stay-at-home mom makes me feel better LOL I&#39;m on my second bottle already
CoverGirl Clean Matte BB Cream. It has better coverage than some of my expensive foundations, and it&#39;s great for combo skin.
NYX HD Studio foundation, or Catrice All Matt plus. Both are light/medium coverage, I haven&#39;t found a full coverage that doesn&#39;t look heavy on my skin.
Densilh May Mine too :)
Fave is Fit Me Hydrate and Smooth
Covergirl Outlast!
Revlon Colorstay for combo/oily skin aka the only drugstore foundation that matches me (no 150 buff)
I love the Covergirl Clean Matte BB cream. It has surprisingly good coverage for everyday wear and I do love the Superstay but it does oxidize quite a bit so I’ll have to try and find a lighter shade.
Revlon Colorstay, hands down. However, I haven&#39;t tried these two Maybelline foundations, but I refuse to buy the Fit Me with no pump or tube dispenser.
physicians formula healthy foundation you&#39;ll love it!!!
Still on the hunt for my HG foundation. Went to Ulta to buy both, I’m hoping one of them could be the one 🤩🤞
I love the Maybelline Better Skin Foundation, and I never see anyone talking about it. I rotate that (for medium coverage) or Rimmel BB Cream (for light coverage) depending on how I&#39;m feeling. Set with NYC Smooth Skin Powder and I&#39;m good to go.
Catrice all matt plus is really good! I have combination/dehydrated skin
BeautywithEmilyFox bourjois healthy mix serum :)))
Affinitone, bourjois healthy mix
Cover girl matte B.B. cream, cover girl elixir, and maybelline dream matte mousse. The oxidation of cover girl drives me nuts though. Anyone have recommendations for a foundation with light olive undertones??
BeautywithEmilyFox L oreal pro glow in 202 looks best on my combo/normal skin
I am patiently waiting until Fit Me has pump..🤪😅
Bourjois Healthy Mix foundation ...it has a chanel quality!
+Vina DS me too
I love The Ordinary Serum Foundation, Maybelline Dream Satin, Revlon Colorstay for dry skin &amp; L’oreal True Match.. each of them has pump.. Tempted to try Bourjouis Healthy Mix Serum 🤩
Catrice HD High Coverage liquid, Loreal True Match, Max Factor Miracle touch, Loreal 24 hr Infallible (glass bottle) and Max Factor Lasting Performance. 😊
Emily hi . My favorite makeup is the colorstay whipped cream. Loved your videos. Kisses from Greece!!💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
Claudia never heard of this one. I have dry skin as well
Both of The Ordinary foundation formulas because the color is a hit and it’s such a light texture.  I just found a FitMe in my shade and loved how it applies ... so we’ll see ;)
My everyday Go-To foundations are currently, CoverGirl Vitalist Elixer, L&quot;Oreal Lumi, and Maybelline Fit Me Hydrate and Smooth.  When I&#39;m not bothering to do a full make up and unconcerned with it lasting, I will opt for Physicians Formula Super BB cream.  It&#39;s quick and easy and moisturizes as it melts easily and flawlessly into my skin.  It&#39;s coverage is light but it leaves my skin dewy and healthy looking.  Just know that it doesn&#39;t last, even IF I set it with powder. (combination skin)
What&#39;s the shade of fit me did you use?
Amel Souig  332 Golden Caramel
BeautywithEmilyFox Loreal pro matte and Maybelline fit me m&amp;p. Pro matte is a tad too matte and fit me m&amp;p is a tad too light coverage so together they are perfect! They last all day on my oily skin and look very good.
BeautywithEmilyFox A
BeautywithEmilyFox fit me dewy
Fit me mixed with the superstay actually! Or just the superstay if I want 100 percent full coverage.
BeautywithEmilyFox what is your shade using fit me foundation
bam mel if your asking me 125 in fit me and 120 in superstay!
Maybelline fit me matte and poreless and la girl pro coverage Illuminating foundation.
BeautywithEmilyFox i
L&#39;Oreal&#39;s regular foundation in &quot;neutral&quot; colors claims to be good for olive complexions. I thought I was neutral until it started to oxidize yellow on me. Now I mix 2 parts neutral to one part cool. My sister has olive skin, so I&#39;ll pass the neutral colors on to her. HTH! ~Anastacia In Cleveland
I like Maybelline Matte + Poreless, The Ordinary (doesn&#39;t oxidize), and L&#39;Oreal Pro Matte mixed with Pro Glow. I love the red-cap Rimmel, but they no longer make it :-(<br>Edit: I&#39;ve been trying a lot of foundations lately to help a friend with her first-ever makeup kit. Nyx has their Hydra Touch powder foundation that can be applied wet or dry that works well for my oily skin. They also have a &quot;mineral&quot; stick foundation that works well and matches my fair skin tone  beautifully. I set that with my Stay Matte But Not Flat powder foundation for a near-flawless finish.
Nyx has a mix-in transformer for olive skin. It can correct what foundation you have. Also, L&#39;Oreal claims that their True Match foundations in Neutral will work for olive complexions. HTH!
Matte+Poreless and Superstay Foundations
It Has to be The Fit me Foundation In Liquid and L&#39;oréal Infallable Foundation in Pro-Matte
Fit Me Foundation and guess what we have the same shade I&#39;m 125 too 😂😂😂
BeautywithEmilyFox Thank you it was helpful for me ❤️
@Ashley B. if you have not used Maybelline fit me foundation then you are missing something in life
@Ida C. <br>Did it break you out?
The super stay i just hate that i can never find my shade
What shade is the maybelline that you used?
la girl pro matte
I like L’Oreal true match for my 43 years old normal to dry skin type.
I wear both of them together. I put the Fit Me then the Super stay.
Fit me and democall
I like Maybelline Fit Me Foundation 😁
L&#39;Oréal pro glow, fresh wear and Maybelline super stay are the best
The fondation Fit me matte poreless and dewy smooth its the same






















None!


As mentioned in the video, these are my summer shades
@BeautywithEmilyFox Does it oxidizes??  Should I buy a lighter shade?<br>Mine is normally like 120 but someone said I should buy 115<br>My skin is like light to medium with warm undertones


Hence the &quot;these are my summer shades&quot; :)




soo which one deos not oxizide 😓









k






I know this is a year after your first comment, but have you found any other foundations that you really like? because I love the fit me matte and poreless too but haven&#39;t found anything else besides it that I really love aside from the cyo foundation which was discontinued😭

no

Then which one u like more
@Ramgadiya Kulprakash Singh I like the 24 he, full coverage for winter or when I&#39;m going out or something that I want to glam up for and the fit me for everyday where during the summer.



Is your skin oily?
@Akasha Wajid Only round my nose leading into my cheeks and chin area.


Sunanda Dutta. What’s your Mac shade and L’Oréal true match shade







More and more brands are now selling white foundation to mix! NYX, The Body Shop, LA Girl, etc all have some so if it&#39;s a common issue for you it might be worth getting one :)


I mentioned that they&#39;re my summer shades!







Rayvester Reo 120 x




It&#39;s almost as if English wasn&#39;t my first language.

I&#39;m 120 with warm undertones, but it oxidizes so it means that I should buy 115??


















I dont see it







Becca Rose <b>usually</b> ending 5 is pink and 0 is yellow. Together neutral


did you find your shade in superstay ? Im 120 in fit me and idk what my shade in superstay will be 😭
i just bought 122 today and i am 127 in super stay





What lotion would you recommend ?


























Luner Rose try 102 in mate and poreless and 10 ivory in the superstay

I’m 220 and didn’t know what shade to get so thank you!! Was the foundation lighter or darker so you think?
Compared to the original 220 I mean!
The #128 SuperStay starts &quot;lighter&quot; than I like but it soon oxidizes and matches my neck better (I use sunscreen every day, so my face is lighter and less &quot;warm-toned&quot; than my body.)  The #220 SuperStay got very orange on me, so it ended not matching my neck or my face.  I&#39;ve discovered that the coverage of this SuperStay is more than I need/like for every day, so I&#39;ve been using the 220 Fit Me all over, and bouncing a damp sponge with a tiny amount of the SuperStay 128 over my cheeks, where I have hyperpigmentation (melasma).  This combination gives me a more natural look with extra coverage only where I need it most.  I hope this helps you find your shade!
Irai Rod I&#39;m also 220 in the Fit Me foundation, for some reason I bought the shade 120 in Superstay and it ended up being too light for me, so I want to buy another shade. But I&#39;m not sure about which one to buy :( I thought they would be the same shade.
I used 120 for FitMe, and 120 in Superstay oxidise like prawn, while 115 in superstay is too light for me. Sister couldn’t buy SuperStay foundation because she couldn’t get her shade 😢
Does Maybelline Fit Me 220 Natural beige has yellow undertone? I&#39;m still debating whether to get 220 or 228  😩
Bebil J 220 has neutral undertone
Same!!!🙀 I&#39;m Warm Nude on Maybelline Superstay after trying Buff Beige which was too dark for me and left me looking orange!!! On Fit me i&#39;m 220 too!!!
I’m 220 in Fit Me and I use the 220 in Superstay during summer and 128 or 120 during the rest of the year.
I tried 220 at first it matched but after a while I became a dark trump... So yes I might try 128 thanks
Ohmygod youre an angel. Ive been trying to find the perfect shade and was contemplating whether I should by 220 or 128. Definitely getting 128!! Thank you!!!!
Hi! What is your shade in wet n wild photophocus foundation?



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIscwTOicNQ&amp;t=2m53s">2:53</a>


Ah same

I was wondering the same thing! One YouTuber bought a pump (either from Mac or Estee Lauder) for her Fit Me bottle, but she said that the pump fit rather loosely, and she had to be careful with storing the bottle. Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if Maybelline sold a pump separately (as they seem determined not to put pumps on all their bottles of foundation)? The demand is already there, so it seems possible from a business standpoint.
Brightfox&#39;s Den IKR
TheCutienpink6 the pump doesn&#39;t come off the superstay :(
Mehak Rashid oh dang! Ok thank you
I bought some makeup bottles with pumps from Amazon. I spent a bit of my time transferring my Maybelline foundations into them, but the effort was worth it!
oh ok thanks I will look for some on there too.





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIscwTOicNQ&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a>


TheLifeOfEmily I read a comment that the super stay oxidizes so I would go 110
TheLifeOfEmily I&#39;m the same shade as you for the fit me but haven&#39;t tried the super stay




That&#39;s a great idea!!
What a cool solution to the problem! I use the fingertip-over-the-opening-of -the -bottle method to apply my Matte + Poreless, and that gets so messy even though I use less product when I use this method. Those little drops of foundation that land on my clothes are almost impossible to spot clean!
They sell airless pump foundation bottles on amazon really cheap. Try that
Thanks!
Brightfox&#39;s Den yvw.
Excellent idea! Thanks! ~Anastacia in Cleveland
I&#39;ve gone and ordered the bottles. Looking forward to getting them!
Brightfox&#39;s Den great!!! They work so well. I hope they work out for you!


It&#39;s my summer shade!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIscwTOicNQ&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a>
Haha I&#39;m 112
@Jen Cox im also 112
I am Shade 118 too. Try the Sand concealer with it...it&#39;s SOOOO GOOD!



That&#39;s it I&#39;m jelly!
And we had it in a pump at first!
But it cost $16 instead of $8
in India too
In Morocco too
In philippines,we can buy at drugstore a maybelline in sachet
In Pakistan too🥳
In Kenya too




Avantvous me too! It breaks up on me so badly.
I didn&#39;t like it either, but also for a different reason.  It made me look like a corpse...sooo drying on my combo skin.<br>Hydrate and Smooth is so much better (when I set it with powder) but what&#39;s weird is, the shades between the 2 different formulas aren&#39;t congruent.  In other words, Fit Me hydrate &amp; smooth in 120 is NOT the same as Fit Me matte &amp; poreless 120 :-(  What&#39;s with that? !!
Carrie Stewart it&#39;s because the dewy one oxzidises and the matte one doesn&#39;t
Kera Super Interesting. The matte one oxidizes about 2 shades darker on my skin throughout the day.
I know! I don’t understand how people love it so much. It’s awful.
the matte + poreless is probably the worst foundation I’ve ever tried tbh...it clings to all my dryness and gets so patchy and broken up throughout the day and not to mention it oxidizes like three full shades and gets super orange
The fit me matte &amp; poreless did not work at all patchy and 2 hr later soo oily and exsagerated my pores
Me too. I wanted to build it (because of acne and redness), and it just sort of came off, when I tried. Like I would get these red cirkels from my beautyblender, when I tried blending it out, even with the first layer. I suspect that the formular may be different in in Europe (where I come from) because of the no testing on animals rules here. Which of course is great :)
Yeah it’s just an okay foundation for me. It emphasizes my pores around my nose and cheeks and doesn’t have quite enough coverage for my breakouts. I usually apply with my real techniques brush. I also notice that it either transfers really bad or my skin soaks it up because when I go to remove it at night, there’s hardly any product on the wipe.
What drugstore foundation do y’all use? I use the matte &amp; poreless but I’d like to try something better
It always gets cakey on my cheeks whenever I use that foundation. I thought I was blotting my face wrong with a blotting paper, but I realized that it&#39;s really the foundation. I used to love it. And it&#39;s also hard to remove.
It’s too watery
Avantvous what’s your skin type?
I wanted to love this foundation so bad but it was sooooo oily on me within 2 hours. Doesn’t last whatsoever. It looks pretty upon application and after I set it but I look like an oil slick soon after. It sucks because I found my first ever perfect match in one the newer shades of the Fit Me range, 118 Light Beige.
The matte poreless foundation, through out the day it seperates from my skin and looks like i have no foundation on
Sama !
Same i dislike matte &amp; poreless...not only it did not last on my skin, it also did not help to covered my acne mark...
trinity - depending on what store you bought the foundation from, if you save the receipt, you can return the foundation and get your money back. <br><br>That’s what I do...


It’s simply a different technique. Plenty of makeup artists apply foundation this way, it’s simply thinner which I prefer!
Kira Crissinger not everyone wants thick cake face :) .................. some people have really nice skin and don’t need too much coverage
🙌🏻
You never want to drag anything in a downward technique. The worst thing you can do to your face😩



When it works, it works 😂

Theresa Ursal the superstar looks orange on me.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIscwTOicNQ&amp;t=1m00s">1:00</a> I mentioned they&#39;re my summer shades which is why they don&#39;t match me right now!
BeautywithEmilyFox Hi, Emily. You did mention. It&#39;s not the matching I&#39;m wondering about, but the foundation actually turns too orange from time of application. Although you did show it in your hand swatch. Good thing you showed it too.
Theresa Ursal sometimes, depending on your undertone, a foundation might look too orange against your skin if it’s too dark.  One foundation shade might look very different on one skin tone than it might others
True, aside from the oxidation. I bought Loreal demi-matte in sun beige and was about to pick Maybelline in almost same shade but the sales lady kindly told me that it is for pink tone skin and I would another shade which appeared lighter but would suit yellow undertone.
Theresa Ursal agreed. Many have said superstay oxdisss and so did Emily

Was it better?



Also, the right side looks alot darker in my opinion.






so can anyone tell me whats superstay shade match to 128 fit me? thanku

Lutvia April it&#39;s warm nude :) x

Bonjour de Gatineau 😁
ty, I spent the while video tryna recognize her accent, literally could not figure it out


Too Faced White Peach! I have a review with a few looks using it coming soon!
Oh ok, thank you for answering my question and I look forward to the review of that palette. 👱‍♀️

I went one shade lighter since I have 125 in fit me and 120 in superstay so it should be enough!

Essie Without A Stitch!



I love the Better Skin foundation, but I never hear anyone talking about it :/
Some YouTubers like the Better Skin concealer, but I haven&#39;t heard any of them speak of the foundation, either. I wish that was around when I had acne because it contains Salicylic Acid - an over-the-counter acne treatment. Now that I have developed rosacea, Salicylic Acid is a no-no for me.
I used to have it, it made my skin look too natural lol
Cassidy Armstrong that’s the whole point??
I have that one. I was interested in it because Casey Holmes loved it back in 2015 and still uses it til this day. I have the foundation, powder and concealer.
I recently watched a video where Jessica Braun reviewed all her favorite powders. It may have been a best of 2017 which I&#39;ve just watched. Anyway, she talked about the Better Skin foundation powder which she considers one of the best, especially for on the go touch ups. I hope this helps, you may enjoy her video too. Good luck! ✅



Vasilikis Beauty Tips I have dry skin too and it&#39;s too matte on its own for me but I like it mixed with the Fit Me Dewy+Smooth
Dalai Mami oooh nice!!! I have that foundation! I will mix them too! Thanks for the tip!
i have extremely dry skin so i find that it looks best mixed with the dewy &amp; smooth foundation ! hope it helps !
Vasilikis Beauty Tips it has a matte finish, you’re not supposed to use it if you have dry skin darling
Rere&#39;sAlluringGalaxy What if us dry skin people want a matte finish too? My skin looks super dry with matte foundations but gets super oily with dewy foundations, and I don’t want to buy two foundations (however I probably will if I simply cannot find anything)
@Skye I had the same issue but a friend got me a setting spray and that fixed it for me. I spray on Cover girl setting spray after I apply my FitMe foundation and it&#39;ll last alot longer.
I have very dry skin too but if u apply a beauty oil/ cetaphil moisturizer beforehand and prime your face with it it works AMAZING

Was just about to ask the same thing! It&#39;s gorgeous!
It&#39;s a look from the Too Faced White Peach Palette! I used the first 6 shades!


Try 105 instead! It&#39;s a little lighter but more pink.
I prefer the dewy and smooth too, but if you want a longer wearing one I really like LA Girl HD foundation. Decent shade range.
Jamie Monroe I’m glad you were able to find one that works for you! I love maybelline fit me
I find 110 in Dewy+Smooth to be too pink, I wish it was more yellow.
Lyndsay Kancher I love the LA Girl Pro HD foundation (it&#39;s my favorite dewy drugstore foundation) but it doesn&#39;t last either. Both suck for wear time, no matter what primer I use.
Guys go to The Body Shop, they have shade Adjusting Drops! One that’s white that has a slight pink undertone for a too warm foundation and a dark that’s more suitable for darker skin girls with a too light foundation (it does leave an ashy color to it so fair to medium skin won’t work with it) If your foundation is too cool of an undertone, use the other Honey bronze drops of sun to make it more darker.
Jamie Monroe i have dry skin but i reallyy want to try the matte one
Jamie Monroe ii





This helps a lot as I&#39;m shopping as we speak.

Cláudia Aradas it oxidies so much...  Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t work on my skin...
I haven&#39;t tried it yet but I will soon!
I bought it and it was WAY too yellow for me. All of the shades have a very strong yellow undertone, so it won&#39;t work for my pink undertone, but I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s incredible!
Alokali Awomi as a pale girl who needs to follow a budget it’s everything for me. I’m pretty oily overall but have random dry patches with my skin. I always set it and have no issues with oxidation. I’m shade 00A and I’m in love
I hate it .. it looks super cakey on me and it oxidizes like crazy .
that foundation is amazing !
It didn&#39;t oxidize on me but it did cause me to break out. Haven&#39;t used it since :(
It&#39;s sticky,meaning as it was very tacky on my skin... And it oxidized alot
Cláudia Aradas i love mine! I used to use the matte and poreless but im so oily it slipped around. The milani has a satin finish that is gorgeous. And i still get oily but not as quickly. And to all saying it oxidizes, buy it in a few shades down. They have more shades online and in bigger stores.

I&#39;m a 102 with the Matte+Poreless, too. You answered my question about which shade would work with me with the Superstay. Thanks! ~Anastacia in Cleveland
Thanks girl because I’m on the opposite end of wanting to buy the matte and poreless, but I wasn’t sure what shade I would be compared to the 102 shade for superstay

Erin Roberts fit me is literally one of my top faves I can’t live without it lol!!
Does the Fit me oxidize?
Inah Balaba I don’t find that the Fit Me Matte and Poreless oxidizes on me which is why I was shocked at how much the Super Stay did. I find that both my winter(112) and summer (122 &amp; 125) shades stay true to color on me in the Fit Me line. I haven’t tried the Dewy version so I can’t say for that one.
Erin Roberts thank you! I was deciding whether to buy Fit Me or not



Nindya Kirana this is perfect my Matte + Poreless is 120, I really wanted to try the super stay but was afraid of all the potential trial and error, thx!
A way to make your foundation stay longer is actually setting it!
Do you use setting spray and setting powder before and after the makeup is done?
I got 120 in fit and wasn&#39;t sure what color to get ib superstay!
Thanks you!!!


Btw you look so beautyful 😍
I hope eventually you find the correct shade! I always cross my fingers when buying foundation lol
I have this problem to 😪 too pink or too orange
It is too white for me I have to mix too shades 😀
I use fit me in shade 230. That&#39;s the first time i bought foundation with the right shade and undertone 🙌
Elfchen agreed, only maybelline foundation I’ve found my shade in is the fit me line , the super stay line has an awful shade range and oxides terribly that’s why I skipped the super stay full coverage, the original super stay was incredibly orange on me even in the lightest shade unfortunately
i always go 2 shades lighter and mix it with a BB cream! when it oxidizes, it turns my shade.
GlamGirl777 same👍👍
Elfchen same. Pale shades need a comeback.
I&#39;m Asian so that&#39;s really not the problem to me. My problem is my skin, it&#39;s a combination, dry and oily so finding a good foundation is a hard journey
Same problem with me. I&#39;ve tried out different shades but it never matches ny skin tone
#
It’s better to have someone go with you to pick your shade. I had my mom pick mine and it’s perfect
you can combine it with Catrice brightening blaa blaa.. forgot already.. it only MYR12
I believe fair shades have a lot of options in various lines and brands.
Try soft beige 28
Same for me I love maybelline foundations but they are either too dark and orange for me or the lighter shades are really pink and my face looks like I have an inflammation. 😂
True! I bought the fit me and omg I looked like an oompa loompa after a few mins! I did learn though to buy the lighest shade. I use Ivory now. In loreal pro matte im a 104

Lyndsay Kancher awe man....ill pass
Thanks for the warning - I have sensitive skin due to rosacea, myself.
I have the same problem with the L&#39;oreal superstay.
Shade?
What shade would this be in Mac foundation and loreal true match and Estée Lauder foundation???
Did you just say 2.99????? In Canada it’s 7.69 dollars , I just got one today
Plez what is number?🥺
Thank you so much for this review. Watched it before I bought it and came back to confirm. I also have a really oily skin, so used the Makeup Revolution Banana setting powder (makes pores vanish even more!) and the Maybelline Lasting Fix setting spray (like completely wet my face and fan it dry for more effectiveness) and the area around my nose actually stayed on through an 8 hour work day plus 30 minute commute 🙈 thank you so much for the helpful video.
Hi! May I know what lippie are you using here? Thank you xx

Yey ! May review na din ng pinay sa mga 310 na shades up. I have fair skin but I&#39;m using 320 in superstay. Ang gusto ko sa darker foundation is it also acts as a color corrector for me, long lasting at better coverage. I&#39;m planning to buy the 332 in matte and poreless. Maybelline foundation, cherry red Nivea lip balm and bench orange powder.
This was refreshing to watch, no extra stuff, I love the 1 on 1 feel of this video.

I recently bought this foundation for my mom and she loves it!
So off topic but can you link your earrings? 😁💖

the 310 sun baige has a cold or warm undertone
A pump! Thanks god, I&#39;m 310 too
Can you share the link to the foundation brush you are using
u look like michelle dy po ❤️
Has anyone tried the original  one and also with clay version.  Which is better? I really like the original  one but i&#39;m skeptical  whether  i should buy d new version  or nt

Great review 👏👌I 😘

I just got it and is it sweat proof it dosent say much on here but online says it is
Don&#39;t worry about the &quot;bacon grease&quot; skin............it&#39;s why I still pass for late forties at sixty-six! Cheers!!!





I really love your voice quite relaxing watching this with headset 😃
Really love your &quot;tone.&quot; Smooth and soothing. Like i can really listen to you all day. 😁

Thank you so much for making this video 🙌🏾
FOREVEY HOLY GRAIL!!!!! 😭💖💖💖
When did this come out?

Natakam ako sa bacon! Hahahhaa

I love the foundation&#39;s coverage! It seems light, airy, and seamless. The shade you mixed looks like luxurious honey; as in the one that gets mixed with milk chocolate. Cuddles to Mr. Miyagi! I love his facial expression! 😍
So nice! It’s really better than before!
EARLY BIRD😍
First,,,,apply colour character,then you apply this foundation!!
Nyc video...but I suggest everybody who suffering from acne don&#39;t use havey make up may be it can be cuz of more acen and pimples spread...so try to do light make up and wash before go to the bed at night👍
I found these things to help my acne massively! <br>- A silk or satin pillow case and wash weekly.<br>- taking antihistamines <br>- la Roche possay effaclar gel moussant cleanser. <br>- la Roche possay effaclar serum.<br>- eating black grapes. <br>These all cleared my skin almost in about 2 weeks. The only spots I get now are the ones with a tiny whitehead on instead of the under the skin sore itchy feeling bumps xxx
Omg, BP literally ruined my face. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s helping you. It worsen my acne, week 5 and I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m 1 in 100 to have so sensitive skin.
she talks like zendaya
Will this foundation clog pores and irritate the acne?
I absolutely love your videos!! My acne was 10 x worse and I hated wearing makeup because it showed itself. I met this lady at an airport in Massachusetts  and she told me about MSM crystal powder and gluthianone supplements pills 💊  my face is legitimately clear as a baby bottoms ... I got aniexty over my face because nothing worked but my face cleared up in two weeks. I also use 100% unrefined buckthrone oil at night and rosehip as my moisturizer. Spf is not my friend either as I am allergic 🤧
It’s cool, I really like u. You reviewed real to everyone when you showed your skin, love u. Subcribed😍😍
OMG 👁️👄👁️<br>You are so beautiful 😍😍😍❤
Tried all the drugs do yourself a favor and go on Accutane!!!  I&#39;m 61 took 3 months with at 19 haven&#39;t had a pimple since just amazing for sure it works and u r so worth it you won&#39;t regret it and your scarring will subside as well as the redness great video I wish you well 👍🤗

It does not hurt mine hurts horrible
plz visit dermatologist😦
You are very brave and you are very cute and beautiful
You&#39;re beautiful girl
Buy you a really good face soap wash daily
Let your skin get some fresh air
You should just use a oil of Olay face soap or dove soap and a really good face lotion
Que número de base utilizaste?
Wow I think every dermatologist is prescribing spyronalactone benzoyl peroxide for everyone🤨 But they took $1000 from me, and I still see no result after 3 months, it’s just a liiittle bit better. Am I the only one?
REVIEW LUMECOLORS PLEASE....
You are beautiful but don’t you use so many products it’s dries out your skin.
Try Useing proactive I think you can only order! I haven’t seen the kit in the stores
It’s not fully coverage I can see a little marks
I have something better that will clean out your face you just drink it and I have some soap that will help.
What eyeliner do you use it&#39;s perfect !?
Primero curate ese brote de acné que tienes, tiene que doler mucho.
Try estee lauder foundation
Start to cure your acne, never use foundation .
OMG YOU&#39;RE A PALE YELLOW AKA OLIVE TOO!!! Yesss😩
Hola alguien  que hable español jajaj<br>Puro english jaja algún  compa de Latam por los menos jaj<br>Saludos  desde Argentina!<br>Gracias por  el vídeo
I used this one but it didn&#39;t wow me
You look like a ghost
my problem is actual relatable to you and my base looked cakey after 2 hours cause of acne give me some advice how to stop look caky in acne prone skin and stay base for 5 to 6  hours! thanks i love your honest review❤️
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱noooooo
you can&#39;t expect for a foundation to cover that shade of red. you need to cancel the color with green.
I absolutely love your videos. You are so helpful for people like me with acne as well. You’re beautiful!!
Did you wash your face after gym and reapply foundation? Or is it the same foundation all day?
You are supposed to dry out your pimples if you wear moisturizer with your acne you will break out some more
It looks to chalky and ghostly. Try a slightly darker shade.
God Bless all 😰✝️🙏
Do you drink water ?
Your foundation is wayyy to light for you that not your shade girl other than that u are beautiful
Have you ever tried color correcting before applying? Green cancels out red
Direct Faundetion....
I have a cure for your acne, I hope you trie it, buy cacao butter, oil of oregano, oil of citronela and resin oil. Mix all that together and wear it night and day also under your make up and your acne will go away also take oregano tea for 10 days.
Just FYI, The Ordinary Company&#39;s Niacinamide + Zinc and Azelaic Acid works wonders for acne and pigmentation issues. It&#39;s cruelty free and so reasonably priced it&#39;s insane. Marine Hyaluronics is great too to help moisturize which keeps skin from getting dry or oily. Serums first, then azelaic acid. Really so many products are so good for skin issues. I looked like a zombie and these products cleared me right up. I&#39;m not affiliated, just wanna help :)
use fucicort cream and your acne will go away😊😊😊
loreal infallible fresh wear is better, this one looks unnatural...
greetings from Indonesia, you are very beautiful
My skin looked like that when I was 13. Acne disappears over time

Sorry I missed word people
Why looking our face not looking our hearts
I am thinking is I made videos so people react love only
People with acnes have the best personality
Do ypu feel the curology helped with your neck area...what did you start using different once that started getting better...I&#39;m asking because I have the same😉😊
i had this one last year but it changed its colour after a few hours...
I hate the foundation because there are 2 layers immediately when you come over it twice.  and with large pores it looks even worse🙈
Hi I suffer from some..- AHHcne
I use this makeup.  One pump is usually enough.
I’m also struggling acne and acne scars.<br>Your review is very honest and showing the reality not only the good point. That’s really helpful.
Looking very beautiful after make up 🔥🔥🔥😍😍😍❤❤
I love your honesty so much💗 I swear when I wear foundation my pores show through a lot. I don&#39;t have as much red on my face, but my face is pretty textured. Thank you💛youre very pretty btw❤
Have you tried Maybelline matte and poreless foundation? Pls do a review
Luck like ghost 🤯
Love how real this video is too many girls with makeup all ready on doing videos pretending they have nothing on their face lol so you dont acually get to see how the product works
Can it still for 12 hours
I love you so much thank you for being an amazing human
How did the adapalene gel work for you?
I only have a foundation😭 i don&#39;t have any concealer. I hate my acneeeeeeee

You&#39;re beautiful 😍
I really recommend to try chemical peeling. It&#39;s the best solution for acne skin.
Voll cover 😍
You are so adorable!! I love your winged eyeliner. Would love to see how you actually achieve them:)
Finally i found your video 😩 i have acne scar on my cheeks and I have been searching for full coverage foundation for my super oily skin. Currently I&#39;m using maybelline fit me foundation and it&#39;s not cover my acne and acne scars😭
I was looking for your channel for ages and I finally found it I recommend for your spots epiduo it really helps love your videos btw x
Your video very relaxing 😎
I wish we have that 110 porcelain no shade like that in Philippines
The trouble with covering acne is that they can still be seen on a closer look and the texture is still obvious so I decided to use accutane cause I&#39;m tired wasting my time everyday before going out covering it.
You are so beautiful
I have this foundation. And I only use it if it’s for a special event. Or I would use it when I’m just playing with my makeup. I never wear it on a daily basis because it’s just too Matt for my liking
i like you so much my sister was facing the same problem than she used biodarma gel nettoyant and oh my god her face is amaizing now if you have oily skin  used it you never  regret
I am using same foundation, it’s hype only. Not full coverage at all. I don’t have any marks and scars but bit of melasma on cheek. That also not covering bit even
Alguien Hablar español
Acne sucks. I&#39;ve been struggling with them for a long long time. You still look very pretty with it🧡. I don&#39;t even like looking myself in the mirror or hang out with people.
Que horror, habla hasta por los codos 🤦
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=8m03s">8:03</a> FLASHBACK MARY WHO?! XD
If you use this and you have bad acne try color correcting I do this and it looks flawless
Ples wtitsh number fonditioon you used
Seriously when other people reviewed this... They were looking flawless... But mine is exactly looking like yours... So the thing is, they look great because they already have good skin... I too have cystic pimples... Mine exactly looks like yours and acne and marks peeking out of the foundation.. 😭 you still look better with all these marks... 😘
The color is way too light
you are so confident even though with all the scars , love
Wow. Thank you for sharing.  I wish I had more confidence like you. I have red in my black skin. Can you suggest foundation for black red skin?
That happens to my sponges when there’s soap stuck inside!!!

guess what ad i got before this?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>a skin care product that gives u clear skin</b>
Aapki sceen itni kharab h ki apko iska ilaz krana chahiye
Man it&#39;s the best feeling when acne starts smoothing out and going away.

Why don&#39;t you try the green concealer to colour correct the redness? And perhaps try a darker shade of foundation than porcelain which is essentially white and redness as angry as yours is not going to be concealed easily.<br>Also, moisturizer could be your best friend in the dryness and flaky look you&#39;re getting.<br>Clean your makeup brushes so you are not spreading the makeup dust and sebum oils from your brushes on your face as that is not helping your outbreak.
your eyes 😍😍😍😍
<a href="https://youtu.be/Q0YJxR1t24o">https://youtu.be/Q0YJxR1t24o</a>
Awwww you are so sweet and beautiful 🥺💕
is that the right shade tho?
try ... rose water  spray! sprits it on ur face few times a day and let it just dry off ... i think itl help with ur acne ... plus u can use it before makeup and even on top!!!
avoid milk, cheese, dairy you&#39;ll be fine!!!
What the number is it?
Di  u  r  so  cute
You&#39;re beautiful. Try sulfur they have it for acne at Walmart and Amazon. It&#39;s like 4 to 6 dollars. I use it for my ance among other things and its improving. (:
the blush and highlighter was really nice
Bence sen fondotenle sivilcelerini kapatmk yerine tibbi tedavi almalisin.
my acne is less than that but its pretty bad and im only 14
Please dont workout when makeup on
Such a cutie ❤️
Just some feedback. Engage with the watchers more and use eye contact. This was hard to watch for me personally
You are a natural beauty. One suggestion is not to go to the gym and sweat with all that thick makeup on. Your pores are starving for oxygen.
Also, my chemo acne looked very similar to your acne, and in all honesty, no makeup would look good on it...You need to wait for the acne to subside a bit first...It seems like your acne regimen is just irritating and drying out your skin...TRY DRUNK ELEPHANT👍👍👍.You will be surprised!🙂
I struggled with acne and chemo rash....That Cerave lotion is not meant for the face...It&#39;s a body lotion, and that will clog your skin...I love Drunk Elephant products ....I swear by Drunk Elephant!! Less is more when it comes to treatment...A lot of treatments can make acne much worse...
Ur so so cute xx
I have a friend who also have a problem with her acne and she really wants me to do her makeup. I have to say watching your videos really help me to find the best foundation for acne coverage. Thanks 😊
Acne will aggravate by foundation
Poor face 🤦🏼‍♂️
U
Use indian healing clay its work
What is your shade of foundation?
Wow impresionante 👏👏
Ur very good
Vou te ensinar um truque para melhorar a acne! Antes da maquiagem e antes do protetor solar, passe um creme a base de peróxido de benzoíla 5% por todo o rosto! Jamais saia de casa sem protetor solar SPF 30 OU 50!! Pare de espremer essas espinhas, pois você é uma menina linda! Abraço!! Melhoras!!
No deberías maquillarte ... Teniendo el rostro tan maltratado ...
I have a lot of acne too and it looked really beautiful with this foundation and my face isnt green at all so maybe its just not good for every person. Thanks for the vid tho😘 love you x
I feel very pity for her
Omg! Who evers reaction is something like this hit the like button
You&#39;re very sweet and I like the way you just face your issues with confidence. Hope you manage to find a routine to get rid of acne. I have an observation, although I never actually suffered from bad acne, I found Maybelline foundation GIVES me acne! Those internal painful one... Once I changed to Clinique, they were gone... 🤷🏻‍♀️
My That looks painfull. Hope it gets better.
Well u were supposed to use only 1 pump of it.n then spread it on ur face evenly then use a spong to blend it out🙂
you are courageuse girl
omg i used to be like this . . .breakout on my face then i drank roaccutane it cured my acnes
Hola, he visto tutorial y me has dado un poco de pena. Hay unas pastillas que son para la piel para el acné. Iván super bien yo también e tenido  acné y me han ido estupendamente, te recomiendo que vayas a un médico y te las manden son fuertes, pero son eficaz..
Mask effect 👎
One thing to remember when you get bad breakouts I remember this when acne affects my mental health tell yourself “acne doesn’t affect your SMILE. Acne doesn’t affect your HAIR. Acne doesn’t affect your TEETH.Acne doesn’t affect your PERSONALITY. If you don’t let it❤️❤️
My face is more horrible than hers. I have a lot of pimple marks, pores and blackheads



Inflammation of the colon this casuses acne
Abonne🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Lyposolm vitamin C will also fight bacteria etc....not regular vitamin c which ypur your body pees it out ..and talc will break you out too.
What shade is the Foundation?
I remember my acne, it sucked start to finish and I only feel empathy for those that has to put up with it. Side note, pink looks cute as hell on you and you have gorgeous liquid brown eyes 💖👍
I think us people with acne and lots of scaring will never look flawless , its impossible and it looks like a mess and so dry looking .
Aku pernah berjerawat seperti itu dan penyebab utamanya adalah tidak cocok dengan facial foam. Dan juga moisturizer.
Maybe try a darker foundation
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
You look stunning
I use all of those products the adapalene gel is awesome but the Retin-A cream is absolutely amazing it&#39;s by prescription only
her confidence❤❤❤
I think you are beautiful with less make up x
But on another note with the foundation I actually got a foundation from somewhere and I don’t know why but when I would put it on it would make my face look gray like I had like alien colored skin it didn’t look good at all and it was an expensive ass foundation I paid like 100 bucks for it and it just made me look gray and it was like in all lighting I had this gray tent it was horrible
You should try Chirology literally you just take a survey and then you send a picture of what your skin looks like and you get a special formula that’s special for your skin and it helps get rid of acne and it really works and you don’t have to go to a dermatologist and take all kinds of pills in all kinds other stuff it’s just a simple all you pay five dollars And I think shipping and that’s about it and it’s like really good they have like legit people actually like look at your picture and just do everything to get your special custom skin care routine all in one you should look it up try it see how it works maybe do a video tell me a cool video to try that and see if it actually helps with your acne
You are amazing girl! You look lovely, and hope this helps you, my friend had really bad acne when he was a teenager, it left his skin scarred and a bit pitted in places, but as he got older it improved so much, I&#39;m not going to make suggestions because you know what&#39;s best for you, but there&#39;s hope of improvement with advancing years. You&#39;re pretty! xx 💞
Why are you beautiful with those acneeeee !!?
Use eskinol pimple fighting and dissolve a 1capsule of dalacin-c in the eskinol
I stopped using moisturizer because it actually caused me breakouts. Now, I rarely get a pimple.

sumpah jerawatan aja masih cantik :)
i just really miss ur squishy videos :((
Eres Hermosa tal y como eres eres Hermosa en verdad no necesitas maquillaje para verte bien Cuidate amate por que Dios te Ama y Su Madre También el maquillaje te empeorara eres Hermosa Princesa❤🙏
I really hope that your acne will heal completely soon ^ - ^ <br>Your video is good btw girl !!!~~
Dear ! Are you a Burmese ??? cause your name is burmese name.
Take that makeup off you look like a martian not trying to be mean that it does not look good on your skin tone
I love your tutorials because your face is realistic. Not everyone has a flawless, porcelain texture that works with any and all makeup.
Alis nya jelek ,😢
Eyebrow so bad
I just want to say you&#39;re so beautiful with those acne💖
You are very beautiful 😍
Sade no
Girls plz try some skincare like SKII maybe your skin will slowly improve. I hope your acne will get better and disappear forever.  Keep spirit💙💙💙
Roacuttane for acné.
I love those lashes sm!! I gotta know which ones they are 😭
What a good role model for people who suffers acne..i do for thirty years..and props to the bf what a sweetheart...
Kız gayet güzel sadece yüzünde sivilce lekeleri var
Think u need 2 get 1 shade darker. Think it&#39;s way 2 light 4 ur skin. 🤷‍♀️
Love you
You should try belo proacne cause i have a really bad acne but hey it healed pretty quickly thanks to belo proacne!!
Dah tebal sangat
Hey Beautiful, are you aware that you have   companies stealing your youtube videos to  promote their own foundations?
หน้าเป็นแบบนี้ควรพักบำรุงนะ ยังจะแต่งเต็มขนาดนั้นอีกหรอ ถามจริง?
I love your confidence 😘 I don&#39;t usually watch long videos, but.... you&#39;re awesome!
Tremendoooo cambio!!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️😭😭😭🤮🤮🤮🤮
ولييييييي يلعن حضك مو طبيعي كميه الحبوب الي فوجهك وانتي تزيدي الطين بله بتلبخي ع وجهك خلي وجهك بدون مكياج وعالجي الحبوب حرام يتشوه وجهك
U r very preety..plz dont use makeup on acne/scars. Plz use clyndamycin phosphate clear gel &amp;  benzec ac 2.5% gel. &amp; acne star soap..also avoide acne causing food.u r so confident ,i lyk it..plz care ur skin..
I also suffer from acne but then i start to use facial wash which contains salicylic acid and use aloe vera gel as my moisturizer. Thanks god, i able to clear my mostly of my acne and still in progression.
Why u not put any primer or base make up to protect your skin?you make fault on your face...
OMG...I love you.
Too bright for ur skin
Be careful, in facebook some pages are using your video in order  to sale a mushroom foundation different of the actually you used.
It’s probably better to not put any makeup on your skin

Girl ...Ur awesome !
In Poland we have only light beige the lightest color, but this color is too rose with some light Orange and i am So sad
I hate this foundation. It sits on top of the skin and never soaks in no matter what u use before. Also clings to every hair on your face. Just looks terriable on me. You&#39;re amazing by the way.
Stop digesting cheese and any form of dairy. Also don’t eat bread.

肌に悪そうとか思ってしまうけど、メイクの手際良くてびっくりした…笑
La couleur du fond de teint est clairement pas la bonne
Need to change your diet, drink 3x more pure water. Cleanse liver. Putting on acne creams is bullshit. If your bloods toxic, creams and washes are not going to stop that.
Bowa
ADEPHALEINE GEL WORKED AMAZING FOR ME! it took about 3-5 months for my skin to totally clear up after using it on my acne twice daily! so definitely recommend that!!!
Don’t act like a dermatologist when you suggest to put lemon on spots.
Hi honey :) &lt;3 listen I&#39;ve suffered on and off just like most of us have with acne and I&#39;m sure I still will a little in future, but I must confess mine hasn&#39;t been as severe as both yours and some of us others out there. Now if wearing make up is something that really makes you happy and comfortable then hey that&#39;s perfectly fine some of us women do prefer to where make up, but the message that I want to get out to you is no matter how much acne or less acne you have with and/or without the make up you&#39;ll always look beautiful . and I&#39;m not saying that you were giving any negative message out there to those of us with acne problems because you weren&#39;t giving out any negative message, its just that there are some of us out there whom are very conscious about our imperfections and sometimes we do let our skin problems get the better of us, but seriously honey with all due sincerity and respect you&#39;ll always look beautiful with and/or without the make up with and/or without acne, and this message also goes out to the rest of both us women and men out there with acne prone and/or non acne prone skin :) &lt;3
Support Me Also Thank You😍😍😍😍😍
Try Pantothenic Acid 500mg capsules. I hear it&#39;s Amazing on healing acne and scars without the harsh side effects of Accutane.
Baking soda &amp; cool water.... watch the acne go bye bye.... suffered from it for years until I used it.
Half of the time you&#39;re wasting in drama&#39;s 🙄🙄🙄
RESPECT🙌🙌🙌
I think it looks really really nice
اكو عرب
You’re so confident and beautiful
I once had severe acne like yours. Try treating it with isotretinoin capsules. It works magical
I think my acne will never go away..I&#39;ll die with it urghh


Very Beautiful<br>Acne fighter😍
You’re so confident and sooo brave, you and your video and you in general made me feel so confident with myself and I’m grateful for that, thank you soooo much ❤️❤️❤️
Ewwww that acne!!! Go to belomed
Better than those people telling bout acne with already good skin I&#39;m glad I ended up here!!!!!
Hi I watch your videos. Have you noticed that the foundation comes off and gets on your clothes &amp;hands  it happens for me alot do you know of a foundation that will not rub off ?
I&#39;ve been using that foundation for 3 years now. Loving it ! Covers my acne marks pretty well

What lipstick did u use here? I really like it! 💗
you should try proactive product, they are very good.<br>i had bad acne but now my skin is beautiful .<br>very good video
Wonderful ...... 100 👍.<br>You r professional .......
You are gorgeous thank you for this
Ur supportive bf is so 🥺🥺💖
Which foundation is best for acne???
u luk great even with ur acne girlllll. bdw mine is worse than u
I’ve come across this video because I wanna buy this foundation. I really love the wet n wild face sponge. Thank you for the video.
You&#39;re so pretty 😊
Since there are many YouTubers make videos on acne n stuff... Cure them this way that way.. this will help that will help n bla bla bla...if those methods really work then how cm this girl is still with such deadly acnes on her face
🤢🤮
And I can see the acne😰😱🤭🤢
Girl do not put makeup!! Because your outing a lot of makeup everyday do not touch itttt
Clindamycin doesnt works. Benzoyl works better
Love how you kept changing the lights. Haven&#39;t seen anyone else do that. Its refreshing
Which shade u re using
🖤🖤
Finecea is a really good acne solution, but your doctor has to prescribe it. Much better than Accutane without the side effects.
Really good and honest review . I was going to buy this today but left it. I need it to cover everything i think it wears for 24hours but its good for people who have already flawless skin it would ne great on their skin . I have acne too and scar pitting so May be i get a sample to try and decide or give it a miss n go for estee laurder which i wouldnt then waste £10 pounds or $10. But very great view thank you
Try The Ordinary for acne skin. I just started and it&#39;s great for  problems like that. It&#39;s also not expensive.
Thank you for sharing this. By the way you are so pretty. I bet you are allergic to corn and corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup. Because my face did that before I found out I i was allergic and couldn&#39;t eat it anymore. But when you stop eating it it should clear up. It&#39;s worth a try. Corn allergies show up in skin irritants. Maybe someone out there needs this info too. My life is so much easier now.
My friend had sever acne as you do. She tried accutane and it changed her life fr. You have to get it through a doctor though.
Yucck what a face..Why should i believe u?
Love her bubbly personality ♥️ She&#39;s beautiful 🌷
You take to long talking about things like (ex. Funny sponge)
I tried washing my face with only water and it healed some of the acne....whats left is that i need to eat a healthier diet
So pretty girl♥️
She looks and sounds like Anna from the vampire diaries. I’m shook

Ure so beautiful even u had breakouts on ur skin.. Hope this will heal soon.. Nice rv for this foundation
Heya! Just found your channel and I subscribed 👍❤😊
Your sponge looks like a buggles chip
She very amazing 😍
2019... I love your personality 🥰
Girl have u gotten your liver checked ?
Lots of moisturizer cause acne if u ve acne prone skin don&#39;t use  moisturizer

I would say yellow
No te maquilles!.<br>Vaya a un dermatólogo!.
Todos los productos que contienen químicos irritan más la piel y a parte te sacan más granitos. Trata de usar aloe vera directo de la planta solo déjalo reposar en agua un día antes y eso te va a ir sanando tu piel trata de no maquillarte tanto porque te cierra los poros y prepárate mascarilla de miel pura y verás como va a ir mejorando tu acné. Saludos 😃
You are adorable. Full stop.
monstruosa
Pretty I like the shade
beautiful😉
maybe ur face is irritated bacause of make up, maybe you need to stop doing heavy make ups, so your full face can breath.
she kept saying it didn’t look good but i still thought she looked beautiful:(

I always feel so bad for girls with acne. Not because thei not unnatractive their all beautiful I had 3 big boils on my chin 3 year&#39;s ago due to stress because my next door neighbor committed suicide and my daughter and I were close with him and his mother. Like a fucking idiot I popped the boils and I woke up the next morning and my full whole entire chin was a big big scab I started getting anxiety attacks and didn&#39;t want to leave the fucking house!!! And when I did leave the house people kept staring at me!! In the end I had to go to a doctor and he gave me something for the scarring!!! Your beautiful I&#39;ve got so much respect for your bravery!!! Honestly!!!
Got to use color corrector on all that red. Foundation will do much better with the color corrector underneath!
Love your wings! 😍
Thanks for sharing the info of the stuffs you use for your acne..Your acne is really healing good..btw I think you are not using the right shade of foundation ..
Good foundation + good brush
My mom have the acne not like you it was on the cheek so now a little better Maybelline is a good foutioun for your skin my mom is it when my mom went to the doc he said that use Maybelline foutioun now again went to the doc he said the skin is getting balance so it takes 7 or 9 mouths to get better I am happy that you make this vid
Used apple vinigar make touner
Hi, I&#39;m going to recommend a soap to help me remove my acne. You get it in Amazon. It&#39;s not expensive. It&#39;s called the grandpa soap thylox.

Color correct!!!!  It will make a world of difference
Yo help reduce acne, don’t workout with make up on! The heat opens up your pores and cause the foundationy nastiness to seep through

حسيت براحه نفسيه لما حطيت
I have the same foundation but it always looks cakey when I have it on





Girlll i feeel you i have the same acne problem and the same fonduten
you know why your face still red,rusty. thats not the foundation fault . you must use green corrector first😑
I thinl you should use a color corrector. It will help to hide the imperfections
Clindamycin and Tretinoin are very effective for acne. Benzoyl Peroxide is not effective.
This is my face last year..its was a nightmare for me..thank god now I’m fully recover only using cheap night cream..I’ve tried many products but only this cheap one suit my skin 😬😂
For me I’m 46 and freckles ughh I hate them.. do you think it would be good to cover them was just wondering..

You&#39;re so beautiful with full make up ! I super like this foundation coz it really &quot;superstay&quot; on my face and cover my scar perfectly!
I am truly amazed by ur confidence and positive attitude..<br>Ur are beautiful inside &amp; out...very rare quality...God bless u, dear🤘
I think you have to put color corrector before  it
VOCÊ É LINDA😍
Uzu ne iyrencdi 🙄😰🤢🤢
The best foundation to cover acne is huda beauty no filter ❤️
U are beautiful
You are very beautiful ❤
I like you cause you genuine and you ain’t full of shit like the whole beauty community
I don&#39;t have acne at all but I&#39;ll use this maybe  I like this
It’s nice to see how makeup looks over acne instead of perfect skin thanks for posting
You have too use a color corrected concealer before you use the foundation but you beautiful with and with out make up
Nooooo. i just bought this foundation and i have so many acne and dry skin😬


I would say try again after color correcting with green concealer.

Unbelievable
The color just looks way too light
Shade nomor berapa si? Tlg jawab dong . Aku tidak tau bahasa inggris

Having scars but smooth skin feels good :) from someone w acne, the struggle



Foundation name
Please support small youtuber , you can visit my channel thank you
yall dumb, ofc the girl is reviewing the coverage of the foundation by itself, putting a green corrector wouldn’t really show if the foundation can  cover the redness by just its’ own
Hello dear.. <br>Very good tutorial before and after. It&#39;s amazing.
Acne makeup? I do not think so
👍
Using a concealer under the foundation helps alot to cover the redness. I tried this foundation before. It&#39;s pretty good and covers mild redness and dark spots. But if you have super red acne/acne scars, you have to use a concealer.
Hi to all young men and women who have a problem with acne. I am 21 years old, and since I turned 13, I suddenly got terrible acne all over my body. I tried virtually all cures but it didn’t help. I even tried every diet I heard of but in the end i got some metabolism disorder and I ended up with health problems besides acne. My last hope was to try laser treatment and when that failed too, it seemed there is no cure. Then I run across this link. It’s name is: <b>AcneCureOnline. Com</b> It was impossible to believe, and the advices from this site helped me to cure acne! After only 8 days I had first results and after 8 weeks my skin was finally clean. All this thanks to secrets from this site.
Kitna bak bak krti h  jra km km bola kr
hello dear I can help you achuly I was also suffering from same acne and I try all the things to cure them but I was fail but currently I got one ayurvedic medicine wich is working best now I only hai one or two acne on my face
Poverina. Provo tanta tenerezza<br>Io ne ho sofferto ma non ero così. Ma lei è una donna forte. Più forte di me.

Hiii babe... y dont u give a try for pore invisible face primer den u apply the foundation maybe it can help u look more better... 😊
You so beauty without any makeup
i had acne when i used a liquid foundation. When I went back to powder foundation, my skin became ok
Consult a skin doctor
Great video. She’s so beautiful. I’d like to share this on here knowing that there will be quite a bit of viewers who may suffer from acne. This is from research and from my own experience. Acne is usually hormonal and can’t be treated with topicals. You need a combination of birth control pills that help regulate your hormones and Spironolactone (you’ll need a prescription from your doctor) which helps control your body’s production of androgens which causes acne. I’ve suffered from hormonal acne most of my 20’s until I started this medication regime. This is the only thing that works! So if you have severe acne, it’s most likely what’s going inside of your body (hormones, endocrine issues) Diet and exercise as well as sleep are crucial for achieving good skin. I just wanted to share that, surprisingly most women still don’t know this about acne and how to treat it.
This foundation colour  is too much light than your real skin tone. I think so.
OMFG YOUR SPONS IS WEIRD 😂😂😂 LOL
i love your self confidence... i hope your acne will go away.. i have few in my chin and they seem to stay forever <br><br>youre still pretty. 😊
love the finished look😍
Beautiful
I salute you girl🙆 Slay it be confidence even if the struggle is here😑 Same here i have breakouts right now and im very stress about this acne😬
THE FOUNDATION COLOUR IS NOT RIGHT FOR YOU!
God bless you always 💜 Thanks for the tutorial, I have age spots so I think this will help.🌹
You are beautiful and strong girl, i love this video.❤ I have acne too but I dont know haw a do this.
Woman without acne is like the sky without stars, love your brave and tutorial, Hi from BKK, Thailand
Пиздец
Curacné is the best for acne why you d&#39;ont take it
ever  heard about pcos?
Are you using curacné for your acné !!
D R I N K  A  L O T  O F  W A T E R (not being rude, it will really help I swear)


I want your confidence so bad
Mascarilla de carbonato con limón es buenísimo para el acné
نحنا ازا لبنت طلعلها حب بوشها بصيرو يقولوا  ليك وشها مليان حب وما حلوة وبكروها بحالها من الحكي شوفو هي اديش روحها حلوة ومتفائلة وما هاما الحب الي عندها
Ur cute even with ur acne girl 😍😍
Hi guys..i have also a video using maybelline foundation..and i am so loving the result..its on my channel..hope you can visit too..
Just an advice,  you shouldn&#39;t wear make up while working out..
Go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=3m04s">3:04</a> for the actual foundation application 😑
I have the same skin as you, thank you for your videos they are very helpful
Yu r very very bad yutuber😡😡😡
First you cut your nails then it will cure
That shade is way too light for u, im sorry

The thing i like about you u seem like a positive person u don&#39;t let ur acne take ova ur life I love how ur open and honest about ur acne i see hope for u u know exactly wat products work for you good job with all the products ur using .
Itna makeup laga kar koi bhi khubsurat dikh sakta hai
Why use so much foundation to cover your acne when you can use a green color corrector to hide the redness?
i miss her squishy videos ㅠㅠ
Ay sos hermosa
Dear due to heavy n all tym make u suffer from these type of prblms
I have acne too. But it&#39;s in the form of dark spot scarring and over producing melanin. I use color correctors right after priming to even my skin tone. Red for blue/purple,  Purple for green, and Green for redness. It&#39;s crazy but it works. That&#39;s what I used for the makeup I have on in my profile photo.
This is my everyday foundation....I love it. You look gorgeous girl.
It  irritates  when  she  speaks
TRY ACUTANE?!?!!?
I&#39;m a GIRL who don&#39;t know how to make up LOL 😂
I don&#39;t often wear make up as I can never be bothered to take time to do it. But I have tried this Maybelline foundation and had the  same problems around the nose, it was sooo cakey! Perhaps if I could find a great foundation id wear make up more! <br>I do have a question, after testing a new foundation and deciding it&#39;s not for you, what do you do with the rest of it?
no primer?
why deny you use color corrector general question
Sis your skin is so beautiful milky white  you look better then me 🙁 😮
This foundation is super duper full coverage which is awesome but unfortunately I can&#39;t use it because it breaks me out really bad. I have sensitive skin but just a word of caution for anyone who is wanting to try this out!
U don&#39;t look good
Just found your site love your style try using African Black soap from Africa for washing your face it works  it dries your your ache use a good moisturizer
Poro reclamo hahahahahahaha stop that so none sense
Bruh u have to use primer for the best results
Please don&#39;t be afraid of Accutane.  My son had the same thing and we tried EVERYTHING.  Accutane worked and all he had was a headache one day and slight back pain for maybe 3 days in the whole course.  It is pretty amazing.


You&#39;re so humorous😂😂😂😂
She&#39;s soo cute😀😀😀
The thing that can incredibly heal your face is castor oil mixed with baking soda. My honest advice because it helped me too 😊
I like the way it is the same color as your neck. That is the most important thing to do. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=4m02s">4:02</a>......<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=6m34s">6:34</a>  solution, do not use a brush or sponge near the indents on each side of the Nose...Only use your finger tips, to blend   :)  that area.
No te cubre bien prueba con corrector Mac y base Mac quedarás facinada
subs back pleaseeee 🙏🏻🙏🏻
you&#39;re so beautiful ❤️
Aweeome personality your gorgeous sweetie ❤

She might be allergic to milk, pets, wheat and maybe corn. It could be the water. God bless her. She&#39;s so strong. So fu*k*ng strong.
That poor girl, she&#39;s so strong, and she taped it, I&#39;m about to cry, she&#39;s so strong.

ここまで肌荒れ酷いのはアレルギー的なのが原因なんじゃ？？<br>化粧品合ってないんじゃないの？
“flash back”
Hm about the redness.. Maybe a green color correct will help. Im curious to see how itll work on ur skin
Too much artificial
So cute and funny , love u
Oh my with over #2000 comments I doubt you&#39;ll see this, YOU NEED TO LISTEN UP BABY GIRL. Go GET THE GREEN AN YELLOW PRIMER<br>APPLY THE GREEN 1ST THEN UR REG. PRIMERS THEN FILL IN W/SOME YELLOW IF NECESSARY. THANK YOU BLESSINGS, UR DOING GREAT SWEETS
I hate these types of girl who feel down themselves by the way they suffer especially on beauty skin n beauty look..n my advise is cure is  better than covering
Why are you hiding yourself from reality... instead of buying medicine you buy those waste make up product. Your acne will last long because of those make up and don&#39;t you think after 1 2 years of concentration on taking medicine it will be gone. But by covered it up with make up it will spoil your skin and getting more n more worst your acne will increase in spreading all over.  And Why are u worrying so much in the end you&#39;ll get a man who will love you truly without faking yourself.
I think if you went a shade up it would look better but its WAY too dry for you; I agree
She is so positive and still complementing her <a href="http://skin.wow/">skin.Wow</a>!Hats off!
Your skin face is the same like mine rn
Small fashion/ makeup youtuber here! Would really appreciate it if u would see my content and subscribe if you will like it! Thank u ❤️😭
All that make up isn&#39;t going to help your skin and stop picking at it
You are hilarious, I love how you do this.
It&#39;s tiny thing to mention.<br>But my acne got in control a bit after reducing the sugar ..<br>And drinking 2 litres of water ....<br>Love your makeup..<br>Very helpful.

La industria del maquillaje debería de sacar una línea completa de maquillaje especializado en gente como esta chica con problemas de acné. Que los productos tuvieran ácido salicílico y otras cosas que ayudarán a combatir su acné al mismo tiempo que cubrirlo.   Se que ya existen algunos. Pero hablo de las típicas marcas de maquillaje que de compra en los supermercados y tiendas o farmacias. Y que sacaran una línea entera de primer, corrector, base, polvos etc etc
There is a easy solution to this one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar by Bragg in one cup of water everyday for one week and use it to wash your face with also apple cider vinegar was used back in the days to keep your grandmother&#39;s face clean and clear,also no chocolate or fried foods lots of vegies lettuce is the best. This works but you must real want to get rid of it.go to an Asian beautician of holistic natural products you don&#39;t need more chemicals on your skin the acne is caused by something in your body trying to get out and the only way is through the facial <a href="http://pores.apple/">pores.apple</a> cider vinegar helps to clear this from your system and moisturizes your skin.
I think you should colour correct before doing your foundation and also the foundation is a bit too light comparing to ur ears ..
I love her honesty. The main reason why I subscribed to her. Will definitely check out this foundation.

20 percent salicylic acid
Shame looks really bad try chemical peel or laser
OMG!! So mazing
darling....try this....olive oil with lemon juice....10 spoon of olive oil and 3 spoon of lemon juice...mix well....then put on your face morning till night before you sleep....try it whith in 5 days.....with in 5 days dont put any make up on your face....just try darling....
New subscriber here. I&#39;ve been suffering from acne for years now and I thought using the right cleanser would do the job but it doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m thinking on switching up to make up but I haven&#39;t figured out which one would give me the full coverage. Thank you for reviewing this product. Definitely would try this. I love you! ❤

I like her attitude lol 😍💜
Omg, so natural ! I love you girl. All the from Philippines. 😍
Ang ganda po, ang galing!
Maybe you should stop putting makeup and let your skin breathe for awhile. Our skin needs to breathe and you&#39;re making it worse by clogging the pores with those chemicals you pack on your face. I actually feel so bad for you.
You&#39;re beautiful without the makeup girl...though I don&#39;t have any right to say anything to you.. But I would suggest you not to put makeup cause it&#39;s spoiling your natural beauty..take a break from the channel  ..an give your skin some rest... Out of this... .over all it&#39;s it&#39;s your own choice...😇
God!! I love her confidence ♥️♥️ she&#39;s beautiful no doubt and her confidence makes her even more pretty💯
UR LIGHTING IS TOO BRIGHT, tone it down

You might wanna try a mint green tone color corrector to cover red on face, then apply your foundation.  Shiseido seems pretty nice for Asian tones or Ben Nye works pretty well too!  And I&#39;m with you with that particular Maybelline brand; I&#39;m just not feel&#39;n it.  I&#39;m also going to be looking at Black Opal &quot;Stick Foundation&quot; because, from what I&#39;ve heard and seen, it does da bomb job  covering dark spots and hyper-pigmentation with one swipe and without using a color corrector!!! Whoo-Hooo! LOL! <br><br>Since that&#39;s my story (Hyper-pigmentation), I&#39;m going to bounce over to Walmart tomorrow to pick up 1 or 2 shades and test.  Black Opal is a black cosmetic line, that covers from the fair to darkest complexion; covering those with both yellow and red undertones.  If I remember to connect back on your page, I&#39;ll let you know how it works out; if it&#39;s great, then I&#39;ll use it on my clients.  Have a wonderful day! ;-)
scar zone works great for the scares from  acne you can find it at walmart my nefew uses it and it works great also i think you should go for acting your awsome on cam girl love your vibe
The secret of angel wtf
Hello girl! U should try aztec healing clay mask. That mask really works! You’re still beautiful with or without make-up 😍



Plz go to doctor.why u leave ur face like this

I love your bubbly nature. You&#39;re a joy to watch. Have you tried <a href="http://acne.org/">acne.org.</a>....stuff works like a dream🤗
Beautiful err 😚😅
Nice to find this channel
@goldenroses, what works for me is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lavera">#lavera</a> products (cleanses &amp; hydrating cream)
Try Ayurveda , it can cure ypur skin problem with natural way! Acne is a sign of imbalance in body and mind , if you can get to an Ayudeva doctor it would be definitely help !
I have the same problem with my skin before, until I tried Korean skincare and it totally changed my skin. Now, I rarely get pimples. I am currently using Cosrx products, Low PH good morning gel cleaser, BHA liquid essence, 96 advance snail mucin, PHA cream. 😊❤️
She’s got great attitude!! Jeez if I was her I would be crying soo bad😬 keep going story girl💜👍🏻💜
Hi. I had a very bad breakout before for several months. I just stayed away from any products, like toner, any makeup, i did not even use powder at that time. Then I used calamansi, (available in Philippines) you can use lemon instead  it really worked on me. The scars were gone, the dark spots as well, and it reduced my oiliness. Im not sure if it will work on any skin. But it sure worked on me. You can also try using the actual aloevera plant.
Thank you for this video. 😍
I had the exact same feeling about this foundation! It feels super dry and too thick and it makes my face itch. I had to blend 2 different shades because one is too dark and the other is too light. My oil comes through after wearing it all day. Definitely don’t recommend this foundation.
you look great
ow no!!! you have a lot of pimples in your face....😱😱😱What happen to you?
I just love your videos try noxema I’m not sure how to spell it correctly but try it but let go of everything your using just try that cream and it makes miracles.
Girl your so beautiful inside and out!! Just wanted to let you know 💕🥰
Strong
Have you ever tried hard candy glamoflauge foundation and concealer? I absolutely love it! It has great coverage!
you are so beautiful and funny 😍😍 I love you 💛💛
I think you might have needed a different shade But great review about the product
Солнышко, к врачу личико лечить. И нафиг тебе нужны будут эти тональники.
I use 4% Pan Oxyl. The stronger one is way to drying. I have always had good luck with Proactive but soo expensive. I only get little pimples that are so hard to clear up. So now the wash I mentioned and 2% Benzoyl works pretty well. Clindamycin never did anything for me. Nor did Retin-A. I just thought I&#39;d try Clean &amp; Clear Deep Action EXFOLIATING Scrub. It broke my forehead out. Menthol is apparently bad for acne prone skin. Stick to creamy washes. Btw, love your videos. I also follow Wayne Gross. Make up artist.
Hi there, Hum nutrition’s Daily cleanse helped me with clearing my acne, maybe it might help you too?
oh snap you look like my sister
M also suffering from acne and acne marks 😕.. Please pray for me 😄🙏💖
😍❤️
Im going to try that moisturizer, I used Adapalene and clyndamicine(definitely help me, and really quickly,) but my skin was really really dry and irritated, now I&#39;m using hydro boost gel neutrogena but i feel like its not enough
I HOPE YOU READ THIS                  I HOPE THIS HELPS!!                 I THINK IT WILL!!<br>I to suffered from super bad acne I BOUGHT EVERYTHING ON THE MARKET nothing helped I still had it, one day I was in the Family Dollar store seen some facial buff pads white scrubby looking 2 TO A PACK no soaps or medical soaps in them just plain pads, I used antibacterial DIAL soap, 1x at night 1x in the morning then I used a cotton pad wet it with alcohol to wipe my face bc I did have ily skin, after a week my face improved after about 3 my face was 90% after about 6 weeks my face was clear and  after 2 years I&#39;ll get a brake out / pimple ever now and then but nothing like what I had before.. try it the pads are I want to say $1 but maybe they are $2 TRY IT! can&#39;t hurt cheap fix that really works.
Nom de fondichen plis
Where did you go? I miss your videos. Hope you&#39;re doing well.
You should try Tati Westbrook Kiwi pills it works 💯%
You have so much confidence and I respect that!! I’m embarrassed to even take a picture cause I have dark circles under my eyes and I thought that was bad but the fact that you don’t care to be seen is amazing!!
😍😍😍
Yeah when I used this foundation I looked cakey and dry asf I guess it ain’t for people with acne
I really hate ur skin
Vc e linda💕💕💕
😍😍😍
i know that when I work out with make up it clogged my pores, causing pimples
Cereve..changed my life
You are so confident!!
Your energy is really positive &lt;3 i love your videos
Til cover hoga kiya
D most Satisfying vdo I hVe ever seen in youtube
Can somebody know whats her real name? Love this girl so much ❤ I salute her!
Your BF should notice YOU, not your makeup. That foundation is not flattering to you.
Why don&#39;t you try 2 to 3 lighter layerz than piling the foundation all at once. Plus you need to touch up your ears.

I have really bad acne as well! And I have a HORRIBLE need to pick 😕 do you have a favorite full coverage foundation? I seem to find one that works but after awhile it stops...I HATE going without makeup but try to as much as possible when I&#39;m home. But I rarely leave the house without it and at times it looks worse than if I went without..HELP! 😭
Horrible
I love how confident you are and how you carry yourself ❤️ <br>That motivates me to love myself even more ❤️ 😊
Love your videos.  I think this foundation is a little too light for you.
Haste un tratamiento bueno ....no tapes tu cara con tanto maquillaje eso te hace peor .....
Fuck the scars! You are pretty dear.I love to see your cute,confident and pretty face.Keep going!
Y’all dumb for saying that she should put a green corrected first when the girl is trying to review the coverage of the foundation alone

Did this break you out do you think?
Ok. You look beautiful. But WAY to much eyeliner. It’s too much
I&#39;m a new subscriber. I am glad I found your channel because I love your personality. It takes a brave person to show their bare face. Keep doing you girl! Currently binge watching your videos lol
What color is it
Use Widodari. Indonesian skincare products
<b>U SOUND LIKE MIRANDA SINGS!!!!</b>
Please make more videos on full coverage drug store products. I want a foundation which gives me full coverage +dewy look.<br><br>This foundation looks very dry on me but it gives me nice coverage. My skin looks very patchy dry after applying this foundation.
Hey are you allergic to fluoride, like the stuff they add to town and bottled water? You have the classic rash.  Maybe try two weeks of fluoride free lifestyle ie none in your choice of mouthwash, toothpaste floss water or vitamin pills, see how u go. You can get fluoride free versions of all those things.  I used to have cystic acne for ten years and someone told me i had classic dairy allergy rash, it all dissappeared within 2 weeks of stopping dairy, but i think yours is fluoride rash.
What color shade foundation you used ??
You need to use a color corrector on the red spots.
Have you tried Limelife makeup?
Cover your reddness with green color corrector
What Shade  is?
Your are so precious. You have confidence and a personality that is sooo amazing
Use naxima i use to have acne too alot more and it cleared with naxima you could get it at cvs
It is not cool how you’re trying to be just like Bunny! From the voice and facial expressions to the sippy sippy. You need to develop your own way of presenting yourself.


Try hum detox i hear its amazing for curing acne
I don&#39;t think that color is for you. In the video you look very pale
I used to have acne very similar to yours. I used green touches of concealer underneath my foundation it worked ok in a few blemishes... I wonder if it works with the new foundations now in the market.<br>I love to watch your videos and foundation try outs, helps me decide which to try too. My skin is very oily and where I live it&#39;s always too hot, over 80ºF, so I just have a hard time choosing.  BTW you have a beautiful way to do your makeup! I admire your talent to do it.
My face looks just like yours. Very scared, acne and believe it or even more red. What drugstore foundation would you recommend for the fullest coverage that doesn&#39;t look so dry lol thank you! I just found your channel and love you. subscribing!!
Perhaps a green concealer would cancel out the redness before application of the foundation .
Girl, stop everything you use, you make it only badder. Your body wil clean it on himself and wgaf you can do is drinking Ginger er lemoen water before sleeping and daily water with cumcumber.
Syeremmmm
I love your confidence, keep on rocking cool cat!
This poor girl needs help to clear achne instead of coverup
😲😲😲😲
Hi i used to have a lot of acne as well and some lady i know told me about a face cream called<br> &quot; la tia mana&quot; so i trayed. And omg my face is free of acne and dark spots.. All my face is clean and toned im really happy about it. I have been using it for one year and is thr only face cream im using day and night... It does not do anything if I&#39;m in the sun which was one of my fears but even my mom told me about it and i decided to try it. What she really told me to do was if you are going to try it do not use any other cream only used la tia mana every day and used Dove soap to wash your face. I sed to used a lot of makeup to cover up all my imperfection amd after about a month of using la tia mana my face completely got clear, now i don&#39;t used fundacion of any kind i only used eyeshadow mascara and lip stick some times i dont used nothing amd people that sees me often asks me what im using amd i receive alot of compliments they say i look younger that my face glows and it feels great.. If you ever want to try it is awesome and i would love to see you doing a review.. You are beautiful good luck
you can used honey as your option or remedy to help reduces your acne... 😀😀😀
you&#39;re beautiful
I love how u do your eyeliner I love it
I love your attitude. 😊 For the first time I enjoyed a make up tutorial. Thank you so much. You should be an actor 😁great 👍👍👍
I&#39;m 53 years old and got acne when I got the menopause and it&#39;s just awful, and I developed dermotillomania, where you keep picking and just can&#39;t stop. This young woman is awesome and has shown me that beauty isn&#39;t spoiled by bad skin, a beautiful personality and a good foundation mean you can face the world!! Thank you so much 💖
it sucks whenever people tell you how to cure your ACNE like it seems that we do nothing BUT the damn truth is curing ACNE isn&#39;t that easy! come on guys stop giving an advice which actually hurting our mentality and might lead to stressed. Imagine if most of the people here in comment say that without even pay attention to the content, didn&#39;t mean to offense but it also happened to me so I know how it feels :)
Girl I had bad acne too but I tried this pill for acne and now my face is flawless. Honestly you should try it. It’s called accutane.

For u pimple

But anyways ur so descriptive and like professional w ur vids I&#39;ve watched like 5 in a row now lol. Hope ur having a great day cause u have brightened up mine 💖
I am also suffer from pimples 😞
I know its very hard to go out without make up specially when they&#39;re part of your everyday routine, but I think while your acne is not yet healed completely you should stop using them for the meantime and continue applying the products that your derma prescribed and let your skin breathe. But you&#39;re still beautiful with or without acne. God bless you.
Please dont listen to advise from strangers online. I know the intentions may be good but only a medical professional can really determine what your specific issues are and how to treat them. Youre lovely and confident! Xx

اكو عرب بالطياره 🙊
Buy more of a dark cream colour OK 😁👍

I have really bad acne and have recently had a plasma pen treatment. My redness has gone down A LOT! And the scarring is less purple and deep. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!x
OMG its so white hate that one myself
i love ur confidence &lt;3
May be the foundation makes acne more and more seriously，you should decrease your chemical make up products. especially cheap foundations includ more chemical things that make troublesome skin.
I have just AS Much acne as you if not more and have the same problem I FEEL YOU😭😫


OMG...her acne look very painful and hormonal but I love her personality so much. I will pray those will heal soon.











that&#39;s amazing
Maybe u need vitamin c iknow
what the fuck is wrong with ur face is disgusting x)
meu não prefere se tratar do que encher o rosto com esse monte de pó ?
Have you try hipoglós on your face? It is very very good!
You are hilarious! Love your personality. 😊
I have cystic acne it gross and I use proactive it works for me and make up orgins...
You&#39;re a sweetheart enjoyed your make up  tips  :-)
It looks like you have food allergy...
I too have bad acne breakouts. You are so strong and confident &lt;3 Wish that I am too,
yo i don’t like u ur too cocky shut you’re fucking mouth
Kudos to you for always keeping it real!👍❤️
This is a truly honest review in more ways than one! Thank u
Have you ever tried youniqe products they work very good for covering breakouts
😍😍
I’m not trying to be rude or anything, but did you say you’ve tried curology? Once again not being rude in anyway shape your form! Btw: I’m new to your channel and I’m here for support anytime because you just got a new subscriber!
Carnivore....
Cute girl
This sounds like advertising yo! How much did they pay you?
Super acne. Go to  the doctor  now
Retinol serum from amazon! Try it
❤️
The sponge looks like that because you aren&#39;t cleaning it with the right soap. I use the &quot;beauty blender solid&quot; to clean my real technique sponge and it looks new each time. When I ran out of the beauty blender solid soap, i started to use another soap and my real technique&#39;s sponge looked just like that :( Also, I love this tutorial, thank you !!!!!!!!!!!
I&#39;m lucky, my face doesn&#39;t have acne...There is no need to make up too much ☺ but anyway..thanks for sharing 😘
i love this girl
Girl you better leave that on forever then cuz when you take it off at night and a guy sees that face boom you&#39;re done👹
PS,I am a licensed Aesthetician,Pro makeup artist,TV and film,never do I offer unsolicited  advice.
I think it wasn&#39;t as smooth bc you didn&#39;t prime? Primer is just a good tool to add before adding foundation. I had the same prob every foundation made me look cakey but with the primer helped. <br><br>Also on the side note if all the acne medication is not helping try organic African Black soap! It&#39;s been such a big help with my own acne which was very severe. And also thrayer the toner helps<br>With the scars.
Love the eye make up
Try Sally Hanson foundation spray covers everything for upto 24 hours
You’re beautiful ❤️❤️🙏
Use potato 🥔 juice everyday u will see a difference
Chemical peels really work
I found out that wheat made me get really bad acne. I found out I had a minor allergy to it in a blood test. So I cut that out of diet and makeup. My scars aren&#39;t red anymore and I&#39;d say acne went way down by my guess went down 80%. So I&#39;m all gluten free even in makeup. So what I&#39;m saying is u may have an minor allergy that may cause the redder scars. And btw I love how u do ur eye makeup.
Why are you so sassy
Try Accutane .. I tried everything too . From diets to different medications and finally Accutane . You’ll love it!❤️😍
so i just bought this foundation yesterday and i never searched it on anything and all of a sudden this video shows up in my recommended.... im scared


Skoncz wyciskac te pryszcze i przestan nakladac tone tapety  !!
Love your attitude and videos! What has helped my acne is a ketogenic diet. Very low carb- cut out all the sugar.






Fresh aloe vera helps with acne scars 😊💜
I love your honest reviews. I need that type of help. I am old but have just started a channel teaching children violin music. Please come and support me 😀💕 Xiao_teaching Violin<br>Thanks a million. Best wish to you,
If this beautiful girl has bad acne than MAYBE SHE SHOULD NOT USE MAKE UP UNTIL IT IS CLEARED<br>yeah let&#39;s clog up the Poor&#39;s again

Last year I had same case she&#39;s having now and I&#39;m telling you guys  sometimes  it&#39;s so hard to the girl to go on with that  <br>She is beautiful without makeup  <br>If people didn&#39;t notice that ..she does !

Use green to lessen the red.
Ho risolto in parte il problema di acne acuto con il mynositol ed eliminando latticini, cibi troppo grassi e farinacei. Anche il mio ciclo è regolare e normale.
Let me just say this i have suffered w acne for ten years and it left me w horrible scars i have tryed dermatologist prescribed products and they never worked what worked was Neutrogena on the spot acne treatment i apply it over my cheeks and chin (where i mostly have acne) all over not just spots every night before bed after i wash my face and it worked great so far i have been using it for five years and it is great!  It helps control my break outs i rarely get like one pimple i use it to control it i say bc when i stop my face starts breaking out again i also suffer w acne prone skin ( let me just say this start out w once every three days bc it will dry the heck out of your skin it will peel alot n turn pink until your skin get used to the products which takes a long time i don&#39;t rember how long bc it&#39;s been so long but at least four months now when i use it wout fail everyday i don&#39;t get peel or pink skin anymore only if it gets on my neck by accident i get it on my neck and after it dries which takes about 10-15 min i apply aloe lotion for oily skin i hope it helps have a great day (from a fellow acne sufferer).
Your eyes and your lips so pretty😍dont done,stay strong,y&#39;r pretty,i lv u☺
I use to suffer a lot with acne I hated myself I didn&#39;t like how I looked.. Then 6 years ago I was diagnosed with IBD and since I&#39;ve taken many anti inflammatory medication for my IBD it seems like it&#39;s cured my acne.. I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t get one once in a while... But I feel like my acne has improved ever since I was diagnosed and idk if it&#39;s for those reasons.  Thanks for the review tho... I didn&#39;t like this foundation tho it does kinda look dry but ur make up in general is gorgeous. 😊❤
apply a little bit of baking soda with your facial cleanser and apply cetaphil moisturizer right after your acne will disappear and apply a little bit make up. You look beautiful with your make up.

這集讓人看得出來臉形有多重要
You’re gorgeous. A couple years ago my face was exactly like this and for some reason i decided i was so done with being so insecure, actually not even insecure just people constantly staring at me. So i decided to go on <a href="http://acne.org/">Acne.org</a>. And fuck did it change my life dude. I didn’t trust it at first but i saw my skin clearing in the first week. You are truly an inspiration❤️
I love your video, you are so confident that you share this video. And you look lovely with make up, but I am sure that you are a lovely person without it. I know that we live in a world where everyone has to be perfect. But no one is perfect most of it is all fake. <br><br>You are beautiful inside and outside don&#39;t let anyone tell you differently. 🍀🌹🍀 😘
Your so beautiful❤👍👍👍👍
I&#39;m late to the party but have you tried using a konjac sponge with charcoal in it (I got mine from a Korean beauty store) for your pores? I hate my stupid pores but since using that daily with my face scrub they are much better. They do them with other ingredients in too.
Hello from Indonesia 😊😊😊
Im still trying to look for a nice medium to full coverage foundation, thanks for reviewing this &lt;3

Why in the world would you want to put makeup on that ., your face clearly needs to breathe , out some tea tree oil on it
Creo qe deberias detener total mente en esto y retirar el maquillaje de tu vida por un tiempo busca tratamientos medicamentos tdo lo que sea necesario tu problema seguira mas fuerte por tdos los quimicos que tu piel lastimada tiende a cubrir y no deja transpirar usa remedios cazeros y en uno o dos meses estaras un poco mejor!
I just feel like that foundation makes my skin and yours a tiny bit, you can see all your pores, it looks like it’s separated on your mouth area which is what it did for me. I personally hate it and I’m extremely oily!  So it’s interesting to hear that you like it 🤷🏻‍♀️
Product name btaiye
hey do u suffer from acne since your a teen? or since now that ur an adult?
Don’t worry I have acne two and it is really hard because you can’t go anywhere with out make and it is a pain in the butt
Black opal products get the whole with the wash soap and etc it works not the makeup but the face soap ones okay and acne scars will be gone like mines 🤗😆

Dont use any soaps or active ingredients on the face keep it natural, rice bran oil wont break you out. I just apply it to my face so its coated well, loosen the makeup, then I use a soft microfibre cloth thats wet with cold water, gently wipe it away, do it again to get off remaining makeup with clean area of cloth. Apply the aleover plant cut and rub the jelly on go to sleep, wake up and rinse my fe with water use a witch hazel toner, a less ingredient moizturizer &quot;sunkin night cream&quot; My skin has never been so amazing even my pores are shrinking, I shit you not my skin has become soooo healthy
Itchy pimples are a sign of food allergies, I had hormonal cystic acne its all gone, and psychosomatically acne is internal anger......<br><br>Drink water and avoid processed foods, eat whole foods 1 month on a raw vegan diet,  will clear your skin, take your makeup of with rice bran oil. Use a benzolite clay mask 2x a month. Take a dairy free prebiotic and avoid dairy!  Drink lots of water. My acne is gone.... seriously this will help. Try to avoid makeup whilst in the gym, let your skin breath and saunas, salt water at the beach.<br><br>Deep breaths cause I know the anxiety and anger it can cause work through self love on a emotional level. Diet sleep water main priorities, look up robert morse on acne
Before u pit foundation do color correction concealer! It will make a huge difference sis 💓
adoraria q seus videos tivesse  legenda em português😑😑
you still look beautiful
شو اسم الفاونديشن؟

Hi hon to avoid the dryness and visible pores you need a primer. And so the redness isn’t peeking through your foundation you need a color corrector underneath. Just wanted to give you some makeup tips. You are very beautiful and I as well suffer from acne and pigment issues there are also a lot of makeup videos.
Omg beautyblender 😂
I think your hair is the problem thats why you have many acne. Thats also my problem but now im ok. My face is already smooth like koreans face .
Looks really good. I got to tell you girl you remind me of Jeffree Star so much 😁
U should try color correcter for the redness then the conceler then foundation
بحق الميك اب يلي عم تصرفو <br>مو الاحسن تتعالج
Try Neem! I found it at Natural Grocers or i think Sprouts has it.
The dance won&#39;t go away if you keep putting ponds of makeup on
I&#39;m an acne prone too,but I am not hiding it as long as I want to refresh it as much as I can. Don&#39;t put any make up on your face. It&#39;s not really helpful :&gt;

Have you ever tried color correcting ?
you&#39;re so beautiful 😍
You do not make up any more, you do not even cover your acne with makeup anymore, it looks very ugly, you better see a dermatologist, poor skin with so much makeup or breathe😡😠😠
i guess she better let her face rest from putting make up
This just isn’t your foundation, next. That’s what I always say when I get a foundation that doesn’t look so hot on my skin.
you should really try acutane. I had bad acne and it helped so much ❤️
Just adjust you re dieet pleaase
Hey u are super cute.....😊
I think I got a messed up sponge! So weird lol
Girl, you <a href="http://look.like/">look.like</a> a ghost. Try a darker coloured foundation maybe? 💖
Acne is no big deal I know it&#39;s annoying make people crazy but there always Solution for it so stop being rude guys . And I can&#39;t do make up like that to hide it she did a great job
I had adult acne and super oily skin in my 20s. I realised that i had been slapping too much acne products on my face and not moisturised it enough and coupled with my raging hormones...it just got worse. <br>My acne cleared when i was in my 30s and when i started using argan oil and moisturise (water based) it better. Stress also triggers my acne.<br>Anyway, it is great that you are showing on how cover acne scars with makeup. It would have certainly helped me in the past.
Your profile picture looks like Jessii Vee
Darker shade of base would help!  Keep trying!

I think you dont need to hide it always because it will just irritate your skin because you have alot of acne but still proud of you that youre not shy to do a video and show them that beautiful face of yours
Me muero con un rostro asi D:
If u wear foundation with brush, please just tap-tap motion at acne area. Dont swipe :)
THIS FOUNDATION HAS RUINED MY SKIN SEVERE BREAKOUTS ! EVERYWHERE.... DEEP DEEP CYSTS :(

So i got this foundaition recently cause i have oily skin. But idk if its gonna be too dry? And if it is too dry should i just put on moisurizer on before i put my primer and foundation?
What eyeliner did you use?
i have the same problem with this foundation!!! it does not work well with my pores as i have terrible blackheads. i’m really at a loss for what to use. i need something that isn’t as drying and will sit well with my big pores
First time watcher  I don&#39;t suffer acne as a rule but I just wanted to say Thank you for showing this video, you will help so many people  not just the make up but the other things you are using to help your acne, not many people would be brave enough to show  their  bare skin, well done sweetie xx
I never know what to do with my blemishes I&#39;ve had people stare and make some mean n horrible comments. Like im gross or even crazy things like its my diet or i do drugs. PEOPLE are so mean. Thank you for ur video ur confidence gives me the nerve like i can go outside n face people.
I had acne as an adult, it was awesome to see a specialist..it used to hurt my face. I use glytone and cerave.. everyone skin is different..
What brand of brush are you using?
You re so good always
Ppl like that make me sick! Me and my daughter had suffered  from bad acne. I’ve had it when I was young and one of my daughters had it real bad as well . But what pisses me off is that random ppl use to always give her advice on what to do to get rid of the acne. I know they were trying to help, but it’s rude as fuck! I don’t like anyone shaming any young girl . Not because I am her mother but I would see the beauty in my daughter that ppl didn’t see because they was focused on her acne. It use to piss me off. I think u are beautiful just like my daughter 😘
Hi sub 2 sub pls,newbie here,thanks
To get rid of red, use green concealer
I use this foundation, and at 57 still have acne. Sucks!
I am a Licensed Esthetician and the only thing I would recommend changing is your Moisturizer. I would say that a gel/water based moisturizer would really help you. Stay fabulous darling - Love your vibe and videos!

Hi can i tell you something ahm can you use of toner for your face pimples im sure ur acne erased. Because before i have like that but i never give-up i thinking what if i use toner for my face after two weeks my pimples erase just try.
I love your confidence so inspiring. Great video.
My favv foundation its suitable for oily skin as it has a matte effect great for those who have oily skin... I know you have tried alot of products but trust me try FW beauty (fatihas world) the soap bar and black gold oil its 100% natural and worked wonders for plenty of people who have acne.. I hope it will work wonders for u ❤️ ur makeup xx
You should use clean and clear. I use it and it works GREAT for my acne. Some people tell me that makeup causes acne. I usually hide my it with my hair.
I have acne too and I get redness and dry skin. Have you tried a primer for the crusty dry look and color corrector for redness with the foundation?
Video was super helpful! What lashes are you wearing??
Perhaps use a primer, and color correctors😉👍
Anopong tatak nung foundation na ginamit nyo na nakakapagtakip ng pimples
Try and find a mint colored concealer stick, it’s the bomb for taking away the red from under the foundation.
This was made a year ago today lol
Am I the only one whose foundation doesn&#39;t match at all with the neck?😂
Don&#39;t use makeup. .
I had hormonal acne like this and the only treatment was isotretinoin but it affect other things
U shldve put on some moisturizer or primer first so any foundation would glide smoothly &amp; wont show cracks on ur skin
Ppl if you have acne do not put make up on it it will get worse
Ho much it is???
يعني كل يوم تشري فوندوتا وتجي توريها روحي لطبيب يا خي ناس تعيف
I used to suffers so much ace but now I don’t, my case I have unbalance hormones so I started drinking Asana from Texas it is a vitamins helps to balance my acne.Then I starts cleaning my face twice a day.I starts using cooler massage on my face once a <a href="http://day.my/">day.My</a> Doctor used to give me birth control to help my acne and to balance my hormones, but it has side effects I don’t like.Hope you try what I do or you go and see your doctor, they can help you about your <a href="http://acne.you/">acne.You</a> are beautiful btw👍🏻
* can relate *<br><br><br><br><b>my acne sucks to</b>
You are so funny. I couldn’t tell if it looked dry...however, you are such a pretty girl. I thought you looked great!
معقوله هذا الحب ما اله علاج مستحيل
is it foundation matte?
Hi gurl try to see a dermatologist and maybe try accutane it will clear up your acne . Just trying to help
Love your personality!  Thanks for trying out this foundation for us girl&#39;s with acne marks etc,...on our face!  I get sick of the  &quot;to perfect&quot; looking people telling me what makeup I should wear!  Especially, when they don&#39;t have the skin I have!  I noticed how many subscribers you have..you go girl!  Thanks for letting me know that I am not alone! 😉
Girl, you are doing everything you can for your acne, and thank you for showing everyone your brave, real life skin.  It&#39;s clear that your dermatologist is doing everything that can be done to help you.  And it appears that this foundation is pretty good coverage too.
You are very pretty
I like to use the milani primer with it and it really helps it stay on and blend better :)
I think yoy are not hygienic that is why you are full of acne.. wash those sponge with detergent and zonrox.. be hygienic ok!

Having acne or pimples should not be ashame on people, be confident☺ Acne/Pimples doesn&#39;t make our face ugly, it doesn&#39;t define us. Lets not lose our hopes☺🙏 Thank You! Enjoy your life even if you have acne! 😍🙂
what kind of make up products that use to make you face smootj
I love the winged look to your eyes
I have acne and have been looking for a good YouTube/YouTuber that I could learn ways to cover it up the best, tricks, tips, products that work and ect. I haven&#39;t been able to find a good one till now! I also like how u use &quot;drug store&quot; makeup/ affordable makeup too. I knew u were the best when u pulled out that wet and wild palate and was like omg I have that too!!! I cant wait to watch more videos. You look amazing and it was love at first watch 😉
Beautiful girl.

Do you know that you have beautiful hands ?
Oh. Good job.
Dermaroll the scars.

Wow i&#39;m ur fan and u are so beautifu
She is making big buck with her self induced acne?  She can cure herself if she just stop eating what is poisoning her system! We all have had acne! She’s not from Mars!
Girl! Drink 16-32 ounces of celery juice every morning on an empty stomach &amp; the acne will improve tremendously. Mine went away in 2 weeks! I&#39;ve used tons of products that never helped. I&#39;m so thankful for celery juice! Please try it &amp; let me know how well it helps you!!

Please try the new Loreal Infallibe Fresh Wear foundation
Same as me really...
Just curious if you would be open to messaging me? I have some things I&#39;ve done that seem to help me
A lot of dermatologists in the comments 😂
Super helpful!! I have acne like yours so this really helped xx
U should try a Dial soap. The regular one. Ots the orange gold box. I use to have bad acne like urs n my aunt told me to use the dial bar soap n it worked. Try it for a week. Wash ur face 2 times a day. N ull c the difference
your eyeliner looks awesome 😍
OMG😐
Omg
Use product lasoul ,thank you
Can you do a review on seemed ok foundation please?????❤ i love your videos ❤❤❤
No matter how much makeup i buy, i can never hide my acne. Its always so cakey when i do it. I dont wear alot of makeup. I show off my pimples like i dont care but i do. People are always saying to me how im not scared to let people see it. But i dont have a lot acne
Thank you so much for sharing this foundation and application tutorial. I almost bought this foundation but I was very concerned that the undertones would be too yellow for me. I have fair skin with a pink undertone. It is practically impossible for me to find a foundation that has a really good coverage with a more agreeable undertone. <br>I love the sponge applicator you used as well.....I have to get one of those.<br>My skin is very dry and at nigh t.f I have been using No. 7 night cream and ceravue in the day. So far so good. I have also tried mixing a little bit of moisturizer with my foundation when my skin is very dry prior to foundation application. <br>You are gorgeous and amazing. A million thanks for everything!

Did you hear about hijama cooping for acne ?
That&#39;s crazy, it looks wonderful when I put it on 🤔
Girl I have the same problem now and I’m black I’ve tried the lords holy water and it keeps popping up on my face! I’m tired at this point. I don’t put on make up any more only when it’s needed. I don’t even know how to cover  that stupid ass dark spots. <br><br>How ever you’re beautiful!❤️😩
How about L`oreal Inffaible?
You are sooooo HIDEOUS without makeup, but when you actually put it on and cover all that disgusting shit on your face, you actually look a little decent.

For a better recovery from having a severe Acne you should probably try not to used any product make up on your face just let it plain and let the acne securely cured first .<br>Best advice no hate at all . BE POSITIVE BTW that&#39;s what might tell you too by ur Dermatologist.
Straight memory foam sponge lol
so beautifull!!
Fuzzy
Don&#39;t use foundation directly on your skin. It can harm your skin. Hats off to you dea. U look so beautiful. Love frm india
Haha grabe ang kapal ng foundation mo
You are so beautiful despite of having distractions on your face i salute you ❣️
Green corrector first darling to hide the redness then you can put on your foudation...
Hey girl.  This is only my advice,  i also have acne on my face.  I try used aloe vera,  its fade my acne but yeah you should try used it for 1 month.  Its natural remedy so its takes time to heal our face.  Btw,  u are beautiful.  😘
I think she needs Accutane it works wonders.
For the people commenting rude shit. I would like to see you make a video and expose yourself to people making mean comments. If you don’t have nothing nice to say just keep it to yourself. Opinions are like assholes everyone’s has one but that doesn’t mean it should be said. Or shown for that matter.
hi beauty!did you already try aspirin for stoping the inflammation?Its work really good on me.I add aspirin in my toner its very helpful for inflammatory acne. thanks for your vidéo.You are beautiful t!😚😙😘
<a href="https://youtu.be/gRwnPFwBTOk">https://youtu.be/gRwnPFwBTOk</a>
MAYBELLINE honestly is one foundation brand that never burns my eyes. Doesnt burn my face. And stays on.its also one foundation that somehow seems to keep my pimples awayy. Every other foundation nnincludong mac gives me lil bumpsnkn my face..Girl I used a oxegyn charcoal bubble mask it lifted everything from deep in my face... after the swelling went down u can literally feel your skin tighten. It&#39;s amazing.  And a great concealer is hard candy !!!!! It also doesn&#39;t break me out. And provides long lasting full coverage.
It starts from healthy eating. From the inside . Makeup is chemicals and your liver will work double time . I wish I didn&#39;t have to wear makeup. I&#39;m a cosmetologist. And I wish I could go natural...... Beautiful tho
U r looking so beautiful😘❤️

You should go to a dermatologist to treat these acne
Hello. I am from philippines. Use Skinmate sharkoil and aloe vera gel :) it works :)
Your so Good in doing your Make up.. Especially in your eyes. I wish I could do it like you. Hahaha I don&#39;t know how.
You talk like miranda
Have you ever tried the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System ?? It helped me get rid of a lot of acne scars and dark spots!! I swear by it!!
How old are you i suffered from acne sonce my teens but im now 36 my doctor told me it should clear up when im 25 my acne cleared up after 25 like around 27
Man this girl complains too much, she’s got my nerves and blood pressure going!!! I tried to give her a chance but good god she says the same dang thing a million times 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️  if ya didn’t like it that much why did u uploaded? Like bruhhhh. 🙉🙉🙉   Word of the day... CAKEY‼️ 🥺😭
Support!!!!!!! Good mood and gratitude  can help you. I love you. Wish u all the best^^
That&#39;s the purpose of make up tutorials , show before and after.
In reality you shouldn&#39;t use make up not yo get pimples and bumps or imperfections.
You wear too much make up , and your skin doesn&#39;t breathe , you should stop using it. Like wash your face and leave it that way if you want to cure your face.
Try fenty beauty foudation
Ah I remember when I did this acne during 4th grade..and I complain about the spots I still have
Please do not clean out .
Do the make up buh
How can we buy?
I like how she is confident and shows her real face
I advice you to stop to wear makeup for 1 year with your condition.... If you want your face to get healthier... Bcus i know you in pain look to your redneess...just  want you happy with your self



1 Corintios 15: 58  Asi que, hermanos mios amados, estad firmes y constantes, creciendo en la obra del Señor siempre, sabiendo que vuestro trabajo en el Señor no es en vano.
Youre beautiful ❤
I also use Clyndamycin and it works so freaking good on my face. My face is like yours before and now my skin is so smooth and great but my dermatologist changed location and they&#39;re so far from my place now so I just use Eskinol mild for teens for now :(
as someone who had verrryyy bad acne (I still have acne, but less than before for sure!) I seriously applause you for being so confident on camera without foundation, I wish I had the same amount of confidence
you go gurl ❤️
U should go to doctor...
Этого делать нельзя ни в коем случае, прыщи это результат излишней жирности и закупоривания пор, а еще похоже на клеща, и тем, что вы так обильно наносите штукатурку вы создаете теплое одеяло для паразитов, они это любят
Question. If you have acne prone skin, doesn&#39;t makeup make it worse? No offense to anyone this is a legit question.  I think her makeup looks beautiful and wish I had the skill she has I&#39;m just honestly curious

Ohh my good its my terrible your face and acne Terrible!!!
I&#39;m suffering from the exact same  acne and it is because of.hormon So you should try taking birth pills. Sorry my bad.English but i really want to say it <a href="http://to.you/">to.you</a>
you should try witch hazel to get rid of scarring and aloe vera.

Your beautiful keep up the confidence
You sounds like Miranda sings😁 Btw I like your make up!🤗
So young and inexperienced in makeup I couldn’t watch I was getting so annoyed! Benzyol Peroxide gel is all you need and a good primer that’s color/redness correcting as well as concealer and a luminous foundation a matte foundation will show the bumps more
How do you clean your sponge ? And how often do you do it?
Боже вам срочно надо лечить вашу кожу
Your beautiful  gal
I wish I can sent you the soap I am using..
Девочка, попробуй лучше акнекутан.
I bought this since you said it would be pretty good for oily skin  :) 110 was way waaay too pink for me and with my red face it was a huge miss for me, my sister saw it in my drawer and added some food coloring and bam it was perfect lol so if any golden or olive gals are watching this video dont despair when you swatch the shades lol theres a fix
Try to stop eating chicken.  Just try it.
I think you are a doll
You should see dr to help the skin 🙏
I hated it. I&#39;ve got mild acne and it was just so yellow toned. Applied and removed it straight away
I don&#39;t have an acne problem at all, but I didn&#39;t like this foundation either. Too thick, too yellow for porcelain, I couldn&#39;t get it to set as matte as I&#39;d like. I miss this light H2O foundation they had like ten years ago, lol
If acne was a person. I’d punch it in the face. No one wants you omg 😂 THE DOOR
Love the humor and style you have!! Keep up the great work!
As someone who genuinely admires you and cares for you, I think you should take a break from YouTube. <br>I had acne that was way worse than yours is, so I speak from experience;<br><br>1. With social media you will find yourself looking at models and their perfect skin and this will affect you BIG time, even if it’s just subconsciously. <br>2. The problem is; these models don’t even look like themselves, these are highly retouched and airbrushed pictures. But it’s REALLY too easy to forget that. <br>3. Even if it comes from a place of love, people will offer advice about something they know very little about. It’s insulting, it’s frustrating and it’s unnecessary. <br>4. People will downplay acne or leave hateful comments. <br>I’m not asking you to hide. <br>I’m asking you to take care of yourself. If you’re on accutane you’re already predisposed to being depressed. <br>Stay strong honey.
Goodness me !! now that&#39;s wht u call Acne
Your so pretty 🌸
I appreciate that you gave a real closeup. I have acne too so ur reviewed helped.
Your positivity is SO uplifting and inspiring for EVERYONE! Thank you for your honesty with everything; from lighting to opinions! I have so much respect for you girl!
i love this foundationnn
ты очень красивая, а насчет акне не переживай,пройдут обязательно!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Me recuerda a Miranda Cosgroove cuando era más chica y salía en Drake &amp; Josh
You are beautiful.
Such a nice soul x you should try aloe vera  try forever living products it&#39;s the BOMB
What lipstick do you have on
I love watching the bad acne just disappear! You look pretty 😀
I’ve had the same kinda acne, it was mostly around my jaw, and when you say that ‘it looks bad but it’s really smooth’ I swear I felt that in my heart coz... Same! I’ve been there I swear!!
New Subscriber here! 💕 love your personality and honestly.....<br>YOU HAD ME AT HOADOOR😂😂😂😂
Yeah my real techniques sponge did that too
Girl!..... use a darker concealer,  don&#39;t expect do magic with the sponges.
U don&#39;t color correct?
She using makeup everyday that&#39;s why she got acne or pimples like this😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣



Have you ever tried cover fx makeup? It is the only foundation I trust using on my skin. My skin is acne prone.
If you dont have acne and dont feel our pain and struggles you cant say shit about our skin care. You dont know how  we tried something new in hopes it will remove our acnes forever but just be dissapointed in the end. <br>In a month we will have a prom. My mom and grandma keeps on encouraging me to join, my grandma told me she will make my dress. I said i dont want to join cuz i dont feel excited about it. But little did they know im just not confident bcs of my acnes.
The secret to remove acne is dont wear make up and wash your face day and night using soup

I saved my face from acne by doing some steps below ...Let me give my advice me and my 2 other friends also had a bad acne... so went to the same doctor and gave us the same medication called roaccutane and 4 products each 2 mix them together and put it on pimples and 1 product we wash our face with in morning and at night so we kept using these for about 6 months and now our face is perfect.... (and espically we had to stop eating chocolate,chips and sweets in general) and now we have a good face thank god i hope i may have helped u and if anyone like to know the names of those other product... plz replie and ill send u the name.
you probably know by now the rattle was/is a bead for mixing the fluid. its in good nail polishes as well, just a small steal bead. :)
Did you delete your other channel?
Less make-up..is better for the skin...maybe a option?
لي يفهم انجليزي يفهمي ليش بشرتها صارت هييييك 😲
Beautifull coverage. I  would just recommend wearing BB cream instead when working out.
She probably try her best to get rid of her acne, but maybe better avoid make up , it is not going to help maybe only her skin is not suitable for chemicals that she is using. But still okay for the sake of recommendation how and what to do to cover the acne, I agree with her. It&#39;s just that she should stop or maybe also acne is from the blood what we eat. She&#39;s pretty just look her eyes not the acne.
So what foundation have u found that you like the best?
What fake eyelashes were you wearing? 😊
Isn&#39;t there some type of a moss green pencil that they use directly on the red spots and then put the foundation over it&#39;s a better concealed it? I&#39;m not big on makeup but I like to watch tutorials and I feel like I&#39;ve seen that somewhere before. maybe that would help with the spots that are showing through but I think you found a great shade and you&#39;re a beautiful young woman
Wow that foundation is a great match to your shade (neck)!
I have been suffering from acne almost all my life. But with healthy diet I discovered they are clearing off
難しいだろうけどしばらくメイクせずにお肌の治療したほうがいいと思います。。。<br>筆とかスポンジで刺激し続けてたら治るものも治らないですよ。
I recommend IT cosmetics. The whole line is good with an SPF 50 in their foundations. Great acne cosmetics and a redness cream. They have liquid and powder foundation that has perfect coverage. All the make up has skin care in it and is made with doctors. It’s really the best on the market
You should try witch hazel thayers! Still absolutely beautiful still!!
والله هذي البنت عندها شخصية قوية و ايجابية يا ريت كنت مثلها 🙈🙈
maybe it would work better with green concealer underneath
Oh my God you are so sweet and have the cutest personality  ... I see some people giving their opinions but it should be ok .. we are all just looking to help one another... I don&#39;t see it as be mean ...I don&#39;t see anyone being hurtful .. I do think that you should try primer and the green corrector I think it would help anyone with redness problems... and I will definitely try that foundation...thanks ... 💞💜💖💖  Love you videos!!!
I have acne as well. I feel with you. And to all the people that gave her advice how she could get rid of acne, it doesn‘t work. You can reduce it, but it‘s not going away
You should also eat lots of fruit and vegetables and less junk food.
You&#39;re a very beautiful young woman.......
I don&#39;t think you should makeup again until sort out your skin problem, the makeup can damage your skin.
I love the way that your so positive! I love your attitude about life in general !
I also have breakouts last August after broke up with my ex.  Dont worry girl!!! You will overcome that😘
wow, it is so so so amazing...And my suggestion is you could pay much more attention to those products could enhance your skin health.
I understand the feels with acne but your confidence is amazing!  Maybelline is terrible. All the chemicals on the ingredients scare me. Ever try Ilia? Organic is expensive but I think long term of the benefits.
Absolutely love this girls attitude !! She&#39;s so confident and brave ! And she&#39;s so beautiful with or without acne !



You are beautiful sis.. keep being yourself I love that.<br>Lol @that sponge..
You should put blue corrector
She talk just keep talking and talking? Just make make up ? And shut up?
I&#39;ve worked before in dermatology department and the doctor prescribed ROACCUTANE/ORATANE for that case. still you are beautiful honey!

Better go to the doctor!
What&#39;s the best dewy drugstore foundation you reccomend?
Eggs have zinc . eat organic eggs every morning and i guarantee your acne will clear up. The eggs will boost your weak immune system and fight whatever infection is in your body that is causing the acne.
Use tea tree oil for your acne if it works

Did it oxidise
The green color correct would help cover the red.
You don&#39;t like to use any on your skin for redness??

Those sponges are bacteria bombs, use the disposable kind and use a fresh one everyday.
I use Cover Girl BB Cream foundation in medium shade it is light has sunscreen and covers my acne along with Cover Girl concealer in medium, it looks a lot more natural.
stop wearing make up ,u get more chemicals on it that trigger ur acne :)
Does it give flashback ??!
looks painful hope it clears up and goes away soon
Horrible tu delineado para el día. Te ves super falsa
I went out today and bought the Maybelline superstay and I absolutely love it!😍 When I first put it on, my husband looked at me and said wow! Your skin looks flawless 😊 my reaction was➡😃😃 thank you so much for your recommendation 😘😘 I could never find a foundation that works me .❤❤❤❤❤❤ I truly love it❤

Well you need primer so it’s not crusty and add some drops of oil to not make it crusty. Also use green color corrector before the foundation on your acne because green cancels red. Good luck
I would love to see you do eye shadow tutorial
I barely have acne and my skin is painful I can’t even imagine:(<br>Even though you have acne you are absolutely stunning and your personality is so fun!
Que padre!! Muy bien!!
Sis use alovera fresh gel acne problem solution
Wauw I like jou, your are beauty❤ I m  from  holland
In general if anyone has acne shouldn’t put any make up on, it just makes your break out even more let your face breathe for 2 weeks and you’ll see your face start to clear up make sure you rinse your face with warm water then cold
Your beautiful, and I&#39;m so proud of you for being so brave about your face. Btw I suffer from really bad acne too
I love your energy!
wheres the primer and color correcting lol
You so beautiful. Keep going, I’ll support you.✌🏻
I think you have chosen the false shade , but to be honest the coverage is amazing.
U are natural<br>And no matter u are very confident .. love. U..<br>May Allah help to remove ur acne on skin 💟💟💟
I have also really bad acne but just remember it s part of growing up but you are pretty
I think this is great, that the foundation is kind of covering, but I think that you need to use green corrector to get all of that red from the acne to be reduced green cancels out red, so before you put even foundation on any to color correct
Sis I feel you the majority of what’s on my face is scaring things like coconut oil have helped but in the end scars don’t really heal
Its not broken its metal ball that keeps it from clumping up, getting dry. Remain thin.
Tbh with or no makeup on,  you’re still beyond beautiful 🤗❤️😍
Im confuse darling,  why many people in comment assumed that you are more beautiful without make up,  or you are beeter with youe acne...  But honestly i think you r better with that foundation,.... Foundation is  created for  some people to cover their weakness.... <br><br>So thanks for make up!
i think u r beautiful
сочувствую.
I wore this today for the first time and did not want to wash my face!!!...it is amazing
Green Tè...alles product espeziel für acnè...The body shop
Dear...did you have already tryed to stop drink milk ,eat cheese and all that lacte produts ??I guess this can help your skin
Try iT products there developed by plastic surgeons and the foundations are full coverage.  You can get than at Ulta.

Honestly they need a better color range I&#39;m tierd of foundations making me look to white or to yellow
Hi.. To help with the redness of your skin showing threw your foundation use a mint colour colour correction cream. Then your foundation. It works wonders!!! Stay awesome
Instead of buying a full coverage foundation go with a dermatologist!!
Maravillosa cobertura 😍😍
Have you tried color corrector? Or does that make your skin break out?
Please don&#39;t put any make up or pondation ,it will case more more acne in your face i , please buy a celeteque product much better use gyration  product
;(
I have a lot of scars and I get very frustrated because I just wish I didn’t have any so I wouldn’t need to wear any make up 😞 I hate having to wear it because of my scars and redness!
I understand you because i got bullied because of my acne
I used this foundation for a few weeks and I don’t like it. It dried out my skin so badly and actually broke me out. I am fortunate to have skin that doesn’t break out but have oily pores but it did a number on me. It also didn’t cover up my pores on the side of my nose. What do you like? <br>I am also porcelain in every shade. Or the lightest shade they carry.
Am i the only person noticed how white her teeth are!
I had horrible acne. Everything my dr or dermatologist gave me didn&#39;t work. My stepmom gave me a tip on how she handled hers and it works! Just need peroxide and isopropyl alcohol. You rub the peroxide all over your face, and even body areas where there&#39;s acne, and let it dry. The tiny little bubbles opens all the pores. Then you go back over with the isopropyl alcohol and let it dry. it goes into the pours, kills all bacteria, and then closes off the pour. In 2weeks of doing it 2x a day my face and arms were completely clear! Seriously try it! It&#39;s life changing.
ugh girl... I go through it too.   i just cake a shit load of makeup on. it makes me cry to have acne and picks and scars. i hate when people have the audacity to come to me and point at my face and say &quot;what happened?&quot; or &quot;what is that?&quot; i understand the struggles of this and i think you&#39;re gorgeous. as a woman who also struggles, i dont even notice the marks on others. keep smiling.
you are beautiful with or without makeup.
I think you sound like tina yong. And I like you. You&#39;re beautiful.
Sorry, this time, your skin have better ?
Using a green color corrector would help as well as having a more warmer tone of foundation to neutralize the cool pigment.
You have to put green corrector on each acne spot first. It will block the redness then you start doing your makeup. You&#39;re still very beautiful😄














thank me later

U should use a color corrector
Greem Color corrector is needed underneath and the whole look will be perfect.
Hi! My son had the same kind of acne as you when he was younger..we tried everything for several years..nothing worked. It would clear and come back worse than before with some of prescribed creams. Finally i had the opportunity to ask an estetician, he told me baking soda wash 3 per day. Equal parts of water and baking soda by making a paste and using it as a facial scrub. Secondly, he said to follow up with organic raw apple cider vinegar 25% &amp;  distilled water mixture 75% toner. It worked. We kept in refridgerator. He saw results within 2 weeks. He then started to cut back, To twice a day until it cleared. This was 8 years ago. The scaring is minimal.  He maintains once a day in shower still to this day! His acne is gone forever now. Keep following up wth a water based moisturizer like you are. I really hope this helps you and understand this is not a dis to you at all in any way shape or form!  Your makeup looks great! God Bless!



Omgoodess!<br>Thank u for sharing that video.<br>I&#39;m definitely going to buy that Maybelline for Agne.<br>Love ur face transformation!💝<br>Beautiful...

gee.. I complain when I get one blesmish, I usually get one here and there, I&#39;m so sorry
Fabuloso......
I&#39;ve knock your door pls do mine too
Hello am your new friend here
You are so adorable! The lasting power is impressive. It held your eye makeup in place as well as my eye primer! I usually wear Everyday Minerals because it is less of a problem for my skin, but the titanium dioxide isn&#39;t an issue for me. I am looking for something to wear for my daughter&#39;s wedding on Saturday. I want something which photographs nicely. Someone suggested Fit Me by the same brand. Have you tried that one? What setting spray would you recommend? Is there one which works better for you?
You are such an angel 👼
FYI -- when she said in regards to the bottle of makeup, that she&#39;s hearing something &#39;rattling&#39; around inside of the bottle of makeup --  it most likely is a &#39;small silver weighted ball&#39; that is placed inside the bottle by the manufacturer.  It&#39;s so that the makeup stirs well when you&#39;re shaking the bottle.  They also use them in cans of hairspray -- cans of spray paint, etc.<br><br>I wear and love Maybelline Cosmetics -- I&#39;ve used their line of cosmetics for over 20 years!   Not a lot of people know that &quot;Maybelline&quot; mascara was the very first lash darkening product that came out.  The story goes that a young man was watching his older sister use black charcoal dust on her wet lashes and from seeing that -- Maybelline Mascara was born!<br><br>Maybelline Mascara used to come in a flat pink plastic box container with a small &#39;toothbrush&#39; looking brush and you would have to dampen the brush and swish it around in the dry black color and then paint your lashes with the brush and let them dry.<br><br>Maybelline Cosmetics have been selling its cosmetics for over 100 years!  And, the only way to stick around for that long -- is by being one of the best cosmetic manufacturers there is!<br><br>The &quot;Pink and Green&quot; Maybelline mascara is one of the best on the market -- if you watch any professional makeup artists -- you will find that they have tubes and tubes of the &quot;Pink and Green&quot; Maybelline mascara on hand!<br><br>&#39;
But sometimes continous wearing of makeup can cause the acne.  Cleansing with alcohol helps ans taking an antibiotic from time to tine helps too
Wrong color foundation
I feel for you, I suffer from acne myself. I am a guy, but you look beautiful. I no longer really get it on my face, but the scars are for sure there.. It is what it is, I hope all works out for you. For me it stopped in my early 20&#39;s and I was left with scar tissue. I still get break outs on my back some times and my side arms, but nothing when I was at a younger age so I am lucky I guess. Good luck, you look beautiful!
Check out n try using Photon LED lights therapy for the acnes n scarring....
Siento que le duele cuando se maquilla
I have the same foundation different shade. And it also goes on dry and cakey. I tried it with a primer and same results. I honestly didn&#39;t like it.
Was well done hun. God Bless hun Jesus loves you :)
I&#39;m just gonna say...ur beautiful with or without make up (= <b>hugs</b> Thanks for sharing.
Nice video but u talk alottttt infact irrelevant talk
yh u dont rmve so mny pmples?
For some reason it does not let me check out your other YouTube channel
If some people have so much advice n spit, why are they on this video comment? Go on a video where a girl has clear skin and degrade yourselves. Why cant you go see a psychiatrist and stop badmouthing and pop pills and sip alcohal. You have problems to and im sure it dont get pounted out or said to you.lmao 😂 i thought id give my advice too
use Evanescense acne emulsion cream for your acne problem  🙂
That’s hormonal acne, gynecologist can help treat that kind of acne
did it break you out?
You love makeup.. i get that.. but putting everyday or alot will make your acne worst.  *sigh
Yea a brush helps to add makeup im goin to get me more.
Ive acne since 5th grade, highschool was bad too, junior high ithink ihad acne over 20yrs.
Yea it looks like it is healing up. Its not swollen my acne swells. An excema hurts too.
Ok ineed to order online. Those things.
you need to use primer first
I really enjoyed your video, you did a fantastic job 💖👍🎀
Treat acne from the inside out. A low dose fish oil worked wonders for me.




Great recording!!!! Ty
Waht haben
You should try krylon paint stick foundation. They use it in movies and alot of drag queens wear it to cover up &quot;boy&quot;. But it&#39;s a full coverage foundation. It will definitely cover your redness
Hi i was just browsing and found ur video...i had acne worst than yours when i was in my early 20&#39;s..glad i found a dermatologist who recommended roaccutane...very effective..now i dont have anymore acne..im in my 40&#39;s already and the acne never came back .u should also try and ask from your derma...my cousins also suffered acne then i mentioned also to them..now..lifetime benefit...we already have clear skin...
I have the same, do you doctor tell you why nd what it is?
Try the 10 step Korean skincare routine. I believe your skin will love it. Research it.
I’ll never complain about my acne ever again.
Keep doing what your doing . As always use your foundation brush then use the beauty blender to smooth the foundation out  .
Can you please do an Estee Lauder Double Wear Foundation review for acne.
Thanks for this video i was curious about purchasing it, but the dryness of it will not go with my skin at all
Use natural beauty products.  That should help. Also use tea tree oil in you face wash.
You&#39;re Beautiful!!!! I&#39;m 41 and still get acne and I have acne scars so I know the feeling 💞
It doesn’t cover like a full coverage...I would highly recommend urban decay all nighter foundation.  Much better
You should try out Estée Lauder :) it’s the best !!! FULL COVERAGE
This is the real demo, unlike other tutorials keep on saying about the &quot;full coverage thing&quot; wherein the first place they have a great skin to begin with, sounds unreality for some!
ya to dermocol ko aad karahi the
Nakakainis ka mag blog ang arte mo
I recommend you to take a frontrow Lucie white and Luxxe  protect
, I have one of the Real Techniques Beauty sponge all you have to do is put lotion on it and then rinse it with water and squeeze it and after you want to like put soap on it and then wash it again and it comes back to its normal form I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just mine that does that but I guess it works perfect for me so yeah
In America there&#39;s a drug called Accutane for Cystic Acne that works---but causes birth defects---so the physicians really stress not becoming pregnant during the course of treatment.
Aww keep ur boyfriend
Sweetheart get acutane
何かの病気だったら本当にごめんなさい！！でもあんまり化粧しないで皮膚科とかで直した方がいいのでは？<br>できやすい方は大変だと思いますが😓
So brave . love this!
Darling, you are absolutely gorgeous both with the make up and without it!

yeah. your boyfriend notice your make up because you like a donut with powder milk covered.
Allah şifa versin canım😊
Thank you so much for this video. I myself have been dealing with terrible breakoits since my early teens I&#39;m 32 now and still dealing. I gave up on makeup unless it&#39;s a holiday or family event. My husband made me feel better about it and has even tried helping me control it but nothing has worked. The thing that is atuck in my head is my husbands kind word. Always telling me that looks are only on the surface the the true beauty is the personality. Looks fade ladies and gents so stop why care what people thing. The thing that matters most is that you take time to love you.
I don&#39;t get it... The same thing happened to me before: every time I buy a foundation that is said to be full coverage I am disappointed. My acne is not that bad, some red scars spread on my cheeks and chin but even the Maybelline superstay has managed to cover them. I tried both with a sponge and a brush. Have someone experienced the same thing? Any advice?
I have my wet and wild too and i love it
KOWAI is scary...KAWAII is cute. You must be careful or you can offend. :  )
Have you considered a primer for foundation? Jane Iredale makes a great, light primer that protects your face and helps the foundation glide on. I don&#39;t know whether it has ingredients to which you are sensitive.
U looks really beautiful inside n outside.. Just 1suggestion..if can plz cut ur nails..I had experience same prob like u n 1day I realize after I cut my nails n handle my skin becomes more clearer..nails can harm our acne prob.. Just a suggestion.. Anyway u looks so cute face!
Hi miss golden roses,,,I have a very simple tip for ur acne  base on my experience too,,please try it and believe me with this remedy ur acne become dry and disappear,,one spoon of quacker oats,put it ah water till become smooth,little bit of lemon juice,a bit of plain yoghurt,bit of fresh milk,then keep it cold in refrigerator.apply it everyday,leave for 30 minutes...Please try it,it&#39;s a natural remedy my dear! Hope this remedy will help u...thanks a lot!
Omg look like me back in the day I use benzoyl peroxide also went away fast
I bout died when you was showing the sponge 😂
you didnt do eyebrow  well the space btween them large
Semakin seeing di tempel foundation semakin banyak jerawat 😭😭😭😭
your vlog is boring
You are so funny!lol game of thrones😍 love ur vibe 💗
I apologize, I know everyone is commenting on the acne, just have to share this... my son had severe acne starting at 11 years old, I put him on acutane and other facial creams prescriptions to clear him up, after we finished it immediately started to come back.  What we did to cure him was go cold turkey on DAIRY.  No milk, no cheese, no yoghurt, no morning cereal, no ice cream, nothing, nothing, nothing.  He cleared up and was completely fully clear by 16 years old and it never came back.  We started drinking Almond milk (mostly the chocolate flavoured), he still drinks pop, eats chips, eats candy still nothing.  I&#39;m clear now too and I used to break out cystic, majorly on my back too.  The other thing I find I break out with is &#39;creamy&#39; shampoo and absolutely hair conditioner really makes my neck break out if I don&#39;t rinse it out properly.  Try to quit, hopefully this helps someone out there.
That foundation did a very good job, great coverage 👍 awesome review, thank you 👍🤗
i wish i could apply makeup as good as you! amazing! i was an acne sufferer. hang in there, you will &quot;crack the right code&quot; for your skin, eventually.
I wish they had stuff for boys cause my son has a problem
Itonghnemnihmycu
You&#39;re very brave and I think that you have a beautiful soul.  :) I love how honest you are in this video,  it shows how beautiful you are inside and outside.  I hope that the acne fades fast and I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll be perfect. :)
Stop wearing makeup. This irritates your skin
Put ice at night. Moviestars do this. But i like your confidence.
Do you find probiotics /gut health helps?
What is its price??
Do you use liquid soap that maybe tithe problem
Great job Girl...
you’re gorgeous guuuurrl
i love your video☺
BEFORE👹<br>NOW🤡<br>LATER👾<br>😂😂😂
Cetafil works! ;)
Which shade is this?
I just think after the make up,your face seems very powdery.I also advice that please don;t put make up again it will just make your face more worst.If you really have to put on it look for some product that is more better or even organic.
Ok . Here is something that can help you clear up acne <br>First stop wearing makeup go 0 Make up<br>Second wash your face with tea tree scrub exfoliating very gently  rinse with warm water, and then while your face still wet put some MSM powder in your hand like 1/2ts<br>Rub it between your hand and apply to your face and massage for 1min<br>And leave it for 20min<br>Wash and dry your face with soft towel.<br> The secret is that tea tree dries your skin and MSN powder soften your skin like a baby. and kills bacteria causing acne <br>Simple routine it worked for me it can work for you too <br>Morning and night.

But you are beautiful  also
What lashes are u using? I love it so much!!!
Sub to sub? 😊
Talks to  much
Oh no!! You dont need make up , you need medicine😟
Yes you are pretty but if you stop using all these makeup believe you me your face will just recover and be normal
Try LUXXE WHITE ENHANCED GLUTATHIONE sissy. God bless you beautiful!
Hey try skin detox herbal supplements from nature’s sunshine ..
good afternoon I see that he has severe acne I suffered the same and I recommend some pills called Isoface brand name contain isotretinoin I had a one year treatment and this helped me a lot. I should try it but consult your dermatologist to know the contraindications in my country these pills cost 100,000 pesos Colombia. Happy day
I like her fingers ❤️
Man...my acne is pretty much like yours!
Ngeri kali liat jerawatnya😱
&#39;you know?&#39;...
Too much talking unimportant things
Hola hermosa te recomiendo los productos Omnilife para el problema de acné omniplus gel<br>Fem plus<br>Y omniplus sobres<br>Y la espuma limpiadora usalos constante al menos tres meses veras cambios increíbles 😉 me encantan tus tutoriales saludos desde Los Mochis, Sinaloa,  México 😊
Remove you makeup with coconut oil organic everyday , clean with baby wipes and warm water   . And the end use  hyaluronic acid . And your acne disappeared little by little.
So proud to this woman👩
..Um working out at the gym with a FULL face of makeup is literally the worse damn thing you can do to acne prone skin, gurl you&#39;re making it worse. When you sweat your pores open so everything ON TOP of  your skin will be absorbed into the pore. :/ Just trying to help...
try exfoliant solutions, maybe its the answer for your acne.
Revlon full cover pliiissss
💖💖💖
Dios mío parece fresa.!
Looks like Kylene Alcantara,still beautiful
lindaaaa
You dont put primer
Looks good
Mud makeup  like the Halloween   makeup  that  is a cream mud type    . Also start off with a thin oily base  i also found the glow in the dark  liquid  makeup   in a tube use it as a oily base  then the  mud makeup also just use  your hands to work it together   then a sponge  if necessary
linda!
I don&#39;t know what skincare products you are using, but from my experience, Clinique is the best. Pick their oil-free products.
Wow you‘re so so beautiful ❤️🌹
What lashes are those?
That color is too light for you
Just ssking if u get the wrong tone bcse your skin probably have cool tone ? Look at the wheel color idk.. just saying
I have acne, and when covering it, I have Matt foundation bc I have extremely oily skin, but then I just always ends up being cakey
❤😘
YOU LOOK DISGUTING. WTF WHY YOU ARE WEARING SO MUCH MAKEUP? You look beautiful without makeup. Dont do this to yourself
They changed the real techniques sponges . They are more like memory foam kinda .
Remember acne doesn&#39;t mean ur not beautiful. You are beautiful 🤗 I wanna suggest you try the neutrogena salicylic acid wash. I&#39;ve seen some great results on my skin. However if u have dry skin,  it&#39;ll dry u out just fyi. I hope ur skin recovers 😊
You should try dermacol....
Altough you are all very angry if sb gives tips I will still do it here because I dont know what information could possibly help her. It might change her life. ... Stop the dairy, sugar and gluten and yeast. Then see a bioresonannce practitioner who has the latest machines. Lugol solution will also help with the scars (takes time tough). Start to take iodine (avoid the iodized salt and ordinary salt, I use nori leaves)
Use a primer for your acne b4 the foundation
you are so great! good  thing i found your channel! such as inspiration!
we have the same problem with our faces. the only difference is that, you know how to do make-up and i don&#39;t. but thanks to this vid.
I really like your smile. It&#39;s cute and kind of goofy like a cartoon character
I tried that make up as well and no matter what shade I tried it made me look orangy. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23notimpressed">#notimpressed</a> Lol
I know it&#39;s months later and don&#39;t know if anybody mentioned Bio-Oil. I have horrible scarring and super dry spots and patches after trying any kind of foundation. Bio-Oil is the sheeeit! I slather it on before applying foundation and my skin drinks it up. Not greasy at all. And no dry spots or patches.<br>. Im no guru, I rarely ever wear make-up but I know the pain of having acne and scarring. Im 44 y/o now and have suffered since grade school. I use Retinol and Differen Gel and Bio-Oil as moisturizer. Works like a charm. Only took 20 some years to find my own regimen! lol. I hope you find the right one for you if you already havent. You give me confidence just watching you, thats what makes you beautiful. Ok..Im rambling and Im about to go try some make-up tricks, and maybe wear it out tonight! Best of luck.
Have you tried using natural aloe vera at all? Not sure if that would be of any help to you but I know it helped me a lot with redness/scarring!
Wooow you are very nice😻
I REALLY wish you&#39;d list the products that you use regularly, like the eyeshadow palette.
Great channel! Keep up the awesome work, girl!
Beautiful girl, the way to erase your acne is with full strength Tea Tree Oil. Use it on a cotton ball 3x per day.
What is the brush you&#39;re using? I&#39;m with the same acne problem 😭 maybe even worse.
You are so U’i (BEAUTIFUL)!! <br>Aloha
Hey, maybe you want to try apple cider vinegar for acne.<br>It works for me so well!! ;)


Your sponge is funny.. I dont have a sponge never had one but your sponge is not in the mood maybe today😅 But you are pretty that&#39;s important and i love you for that 😊😘
I feel u... 😥 <br>But now... It already lessen... I reduce my dairy intake... Don&#39;t rub face often... Less coffee... I use salycilic acid... U can try it...
I’m loving the lips. What did you use on your lips?
You are beautiful
Wow! Girls follow me. Kiss
your face look like lil tay
First of all, you are a beautiful girl, acne or not, you have a beautiful personality. I know i’m not a dermatologist and that you’ve probably tried millions of things for your skin, but the only thing i can do is share what worked for me for getting rid of redness and scars.<br>• wash my face with St Ives peach daily scrub.<br>• tone my face with murad toner.<br>• put on vitamin C serum<br>• put on a retinol moisturizer<br>This combo literally made my scars fade in 2 weeks, scars that ive had for months. Any way, youre gorgeous, keep doing what youre doing!






Stupid as this sounds I dont look at your acne I look at you and think your beutiful and love ur attitude you are always so pleasant 😛
WOAH NEVER SAW ANYONE WITH THUS MUCH ACNE EW 🤢
You can take that back to the store and get a new sponge it&#39;s not supposed to do that. I know ulta takes them back because that&#39;s so weird
Deja de usar maquillaje y comenzá un tratamiento...
DO NOT WORKOUT WITH A CAKED FACE, RULE NUMBER 1 <br><br>I cut dairy and noticed a huge difference, then I cut meat &amp; eventually went vegan . All my cystic acne went away, now I’m just stuck with the pigmentation &amp; scarring. So I use rosehip oil &amp; vegan soaps to wash my face.



you should try using a darker foundation and primer is EVERYTHING! a darker concealer will help with covering and drawing away attention from the redness.
Dermablend is awesome for coverage
You did a great job on your makeup dont be so hard on yourself
sorry to say this, but girl!!! what do you expect? you want to cover your face with that foundation? it&#39;s too light for your acne.. hello!! you should&#39;ve get the darker one, for you to cover that acne.. don&#39;t get me wrong! :* you&#39;re just expecting too much.
Hahahaa
Your beautiful. with out make up. And I’m not just saying this. You are a cutie and I love your personality.  Beautiful teeth and a small nose and pretty eyes. Your really pretty. 💋
Does anyone have any guesses why her beauty blender was lumpy looking? My make up sponge does the same thing. I bought the cheap $2.88 pack of 8 small sponges from walmart. They come with 4 different colors and 2 of each color. I had been using them for a while and finally got to the pink ones, which do this same lumpy thing. I wasnt sure if it had anything to do with how it was made since it&#39;s only the pink ones doing this. The pink ones also feel more of like a memory foam material compared to the others

Awesome video, Thumbs Up!<br>Also try must have beauty trend, Dr.KOKO Jade Roller <br>2018 Design, Super Cool<br>Pretty Girls&#39; choice:) <br><a href="https://amzn.to/2N6iQC7n">https://amzn.to/2N6iQC7n</a>
Hunny you should&#39;ve used colour corrector x your soo beautiful
You’re beautiful  😭❤️
Hey..you&#39;re beautiful and I like the way you put make up on;I just wanted to give an advice to you as I had pimples before too,slow down using make up or changing brands so it will help your skin breathe and pimples will slowly go..thanks and I hope you don&#39;t mind..just sharing you my experience☺
try putting tea tree oil it works for me
if redness is still peaking through, try applying green tinted primer beforehand
You just need some aha, bha, vitamin c, tamanu oil, sunscreen (to protect those scars so they don&#39;t get darker with the sun damage) and you&#39;re good to go. Try some products by Cosrx &amp; Klairs you won&#39;t regret it 💕
bueno como pueden ver no todas las.pieles de los asiáticos...son la.pircelana..que se ve y que muchos creen....se cuidan mucho la piel...pero no son diferentes a las personas de otros paises..dondequiera existen imperfecciones en la piel..y dondequiera  hay agraciados..aun sin maquillaje...en lo que ellos tienen desventajas es cuando la.piel comienza a arrugar...porque las lineas se ckvierten en muchas y muy marcadas . esta por lo menos se atrevió dar su verdadera cara..para mostrar transformación..pero son bien cuidadosas de mantener su apariencia pública..maquillaje  que aparente ser piel natural...bueno.q  les vaya bien...chaoooo

I had acne really bad. Honestly and the only thing that worked for me was toothpaste. I know strange right, but it did
For your acné you can try Minerva or Trinordiol ! I don&#39;t have acné anymore !
i feel itchy that acne on your face... maybe you must stop using make up for the meantime.
Yes that is tooo matte to your face. Plus it has no under tones.
The eyeshadow is beautiful I’m so glad I picked up that palette!
have you ever gotten something professional for your face? Like an intense treatment or something? If not, would it be an idea to do it and talk about the results? I struggle with acne and I&#39;ve seen alot of positive videos about intense treatment, it might be interesting to see if it&#39;d help for you. I&#39;m thinking about doing something like that too
still beautiful girl with ance
Ok so only some of the real techniques sponges I buy do that! I consider it a dud and usually throw them away quicker! I thought I was crazy so glad to see it did it to someone else too 😂

Good luck.

治るまで化粧しない方がいんじゃないん？
Great video I struggle with acne scars too and I just got them back in 2016 and before that my face was super clear so now it really beings me down and I hate going out in public. I admire you for making a video on this. One piece of advice hun you were wondering how you got a zit its most likely cause you are working out with Foundation on &amp; that is the worst thing to do. So just a suggestion dont work out with Foundation on. Great video though!
You need to go hit up a Clinique counter if you have not yet  girl. They are designed for woman with sensitive skin
Soy nueva suscriptora, you are so very beautiful 🌹❤️
You’re sooooo beautiful!!💕
I&#39;m not sure what the noise is but it does that to mine too
Que tono uso me ayudan porfis !
Love that you don’t have perfect skin! THIS is who we need reviewing foundation! Rather than ppl with skin that doesn’t need coverage anyway. Subscribing! Bravo!
omg. stop wearing make up. rest your face for a month. Just like i did!!
Use inderm for 2 weeks and everything is gone !!
I have acne, and let me say you that you are beautiful and amazing
I feel that when u have acne u need to go less on makeup to let ur face breath
LOL! You&#39;re beautiful! ❤
It’s good that u are only having scar left, I know that feeling, and I still have many acnes going on... I wish my skin could be smooth too😭😭
I have combination/ extremely sensitive/ fluctuating acne (moderate-severe)... anyway. Even Cera Ve products really burn my skin... the wash especially, and it barely even washed my face, if even not at all. But this foundation is a whole other story... I found it to be gel-like... but it was harder to blend than working with play-dough. It also gave me an allergic reaction. My skin itched all day, and my acne was so flared. Took it right back to Ulta.
Lol at the dumbasses suggesting home remedies to someone with genetic acne... I&#39;m sure toothpaste and lemon juice will work better than acne medications
You are pretty with or without make up..keep it up and more videos
Hi friend take glutathion....to remove your acne?
I haven&#39;t finished the video yet, but my sponge does that too! I figured out it is when it isn&#39;t totally rinsed!!
Girl you should take some acutane your shit will be cleared up ‼️❤️ love your confidence
I just wanna say i have acne scaring  bad and this foundation works for me. Heres a hint use a green color correcter it makes the foundation look 100 times better

You are such a pretty girl. I hope you have success with your acne treatment. Sounds like you&#39;ve come a long way!
I dont wanna come off rude but i would like to recommend this hispanic soap called JABON DE VIBORA. it is amazing when i broke out really bad after starting to wear makeup more often i tried proactive because it worked once for me but this last time it didn&#39;t so my mom bought me this soap and i kid you not i got results within a week and half. I will says this drying but i would put natural coconut lotion after. Btw i would rinse my face first then apply on hands then face and leave for 10min then rinse , stay away from eyes and when you dry face don&#39;t rube just pat !!!!
you talk too much lol
Hi, I’m struggling with acne too, When I started using Clinique superbalance foundation my skin cleared up. Clinique products are allergy tested and 100% fragrance free, i hope that will help.
This is a video on how to cover up acne not how to cure it. She does a good job of looking good with make up. Many people struggle with acne and most times it&#39;s not as simple  as switching cleansers or using lemon or cutting out food. Most acne is a complex hormonal disorder and it&#39;s not that easy to get rid of it. But it&#39;s nice that she can make her face look clear with make up for confidence.



regardless of whatever your acne is like, you’re so beautiful and a kind hearted person. ❤️
most effective to stop acne is stop using makeup and do skin care routines but I know some cannot live without using makeup to hide those scars so it&#39;s up to you.
I have the same acne. Wash your face with sugar and you ll see the differend. This help me. Hope that will help you too.
You look better with no Foundation... you&#39;re really pretty and you have a bomb confident personality.. I don&#39;t think after while people would even notice your acne scars
that hodor joke i am cryiNg
I like this review.
Love your personality <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=7m12s">7:12</a>. Thats how i feel when i look for full coverage!
U better try the Air Mat foundation of Bourjois brand it’s really full coverage and non comedogenic.

Beautiful lady x
i am 46 years old and i still suffer from acne. Its so frustrating. I heard you say that you have seen a dermatologist. i think its about time ti do the same. Ya think LOL.  maybe try to cover your reddness first before applying your foundation. even if its full coverage, s you see youll still have break through. I have to just about apply concealer over my whole face before foundation LOL... thanks for being so bold and sharing your story.
Have u tried madecca derma?
try to undergo accutane its really works
I feel like the color was abit too light  but it still looked great
Super 👏 i made makeup reviews and makeup looks videos in my channel
she legit picked her nose at 0.50 hahaha
how much is this foundation?
Disgusting vedio.
My daughter suffered from acne too. We got her <a href="http://acne.org/">acne.org</a> and it worked for her skin. I recommend it. Her face cleared up in about 2 months. And this was after trying so many other products. The last thing we wanted to do was to go to the dermatologist. <a href="http://acne.org/">Acne.org</a> worked and it&#39;s affordable. She&#39;d always had to wear makeup all the time (bella terra makeup) was the only one to cover her up acne at that time. Now she can use whatever she likes. :)
It&#39;s such a good feeling when your skin calms down and your acne begins to heal.😘
I’ve struggled with acne in my adult years and it’s very frustrating. I have taken milk out out of my diet and it has improved immensely!! If you do drink milk 🥛, please try and cut it out of your diet.
I spent almost 1k just only for my face . But there&#39;s nothing different &amp; my acne still there . Even though i went to dermatologist but it still not works . Idk what else i need to do 😔 sorry im from malaysia &amp; my english grammar not so good
You should use wall paint for looking much more beautiful and shiny. <br>Wall Paints Secret: You can Hide Acne xD!

and yet there are people with tiny little bumps and saying they breaking out like crazy
Like ur make up but I can’t continue watching the video, the explanation of how you do your make up its good, its just you talking that way that annoys me... sorry.
She talks to much
U should stop wearing make up and wait for your skin to heal first. Your acne will become worse if you continue with make up thing. Its okay. You already look pretty without makeup.
What foundations do you suggest to cover Acne.  Tbh I can&#39;t afford high dollar foundation&#39;s..
🤢🤮
Try jojoba oil!!!!
a green colour corrector gets rid of the red in your skin, trust me I live by it! xx
Thank you for making this video! I have struggled with acne since third grade.. I am now 27, it&#39;s nice to learn tricks and tips
&quot;It looks decent.&quot;<br>Girl, that&#39;s a fail.
Dear Pretty, listen to aunt Frankie, I had the worst acne in my 30s, your skin might be very very sensitive, Este lauder Verite cleansing lotion took the swelling out and healed my acne, choose all foundation and makeup with no fragrance or added chemicals, you are beautiful!
your so pretty! love your videos!
みんなこのオレンジのスポンジ<br>使ってるなぁ…
Girl! Please for the love of God they this soap from Amazon and stop using ALL that stuff. I never comment on youtube, but had to when I saw your video. But I agree, love this foundation!
You are a miskina



I got new breakouts everyday, I hadn&#39;t ever seen any terrible thing like that. Today, I don&#39;t get any new breakouts; my skin looks younger, brighter and smoother. Thanks to <b>AcneCureOnline. Com</b>
my sister showed me the ponds face lotion, idk if you have ever tried it but it works SO well for me. you should check it out.
wow what a difference, you are beautiful before and after!
I will not recommend Maybeline Products for anyone who has sensitive skin. Yes will looks good but it can damage your skin very badly. I had the same problem.   Clinique or No.10  are perfect for me
@Golden Roses, I know that in one of your videos you said you usually don&#39;t use face primer. Here&#39;s a list from <a href="http://bustle.com/">Bustle.com</a> the best ones for acne prone skin if you are interested. <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/172799-the-7-best-primers-for-sensitive-skin-if-you-struggle-with-acne-or-breakouts-photos">https://www.bustle.com/articles/172799-the-7-best-primers-for-sensitive-skin-if-you-struggle-with-acne-or-breakouts-photos</a>
When I was 21 I had a horrible breakout on the lower sides of my face. I came across some neutrogena at my ex’s brothers house and tried it. My skin cleared in a week or two but I saw results everyday . Here’s my advice. For severe acne wash your face 3x with a deep cleaning neutrogena that contains alpha and beta hydroxy acid. DO NOT put any type of moisturizer on EVER. Your skin neeeds to dry out. Putting moisturizer and makeup in inflamed pores filled with dirt and bacteria is devastation 🤦‍♀️ My skin routine is so dope I can skip days of using my products and my skin stays clear. I also aged better. Since neutrogena discontinues products every couple of years I noticed the common denominator of each new product that I found worked for me was a deep cleaner that contains the two acids even if I have to find 2 different washes and combine them in my skin routine. Also, I never ever use rags on my face or pat dry after. I love makeup but when I don’t wear it I get compliments that I look better without it. Recently my mom told my sister I look flawless and my cousin saw me and told me my skin is soft like a baby’s butt. Things I never heard before. Conclusion; if your going to wear makeup anyway do a power wash in the  am.  (Wet face, Rub product with a dap of water, until it gets foamy. Rub in circles around your whole face for about 30 secs, wash with warm water repeat 2 or 3x) Apply makeup. As soon as you get home power wash with the same routine. At night do another power wash. Eventually you’ll have to do less and less. It’s amazing. Once your skin is under control you can start dabbling in different types of lotions but don’t get happy. Also doing it in a steamy shower gives you faster and better quality results  I hope this article changes a lot of lives because my breakout was nasty but once I found a routine I realized it gives my skin a better smoother toned complexion. No pores good luck!! If you try my routine for about a month reply your results.
Why don’t you go on medication??? It always works


I’m so sorry for you....
thanks cutie 😍 love you too
don&#39;t use make up... it&#39;s damaging your skin even more....





I literally just stumbled across your channel tonight and holy moly, you are incredibly gorgeous and such a breath of fresh air! I really appreciate your helpful videos and recommendations on all these different foundations! I struggle with acne as well and sometimes I get cysts on my face which is also a darn struggle for me as for everyone else but anyways, I just wanted to say thank you girlie! Keep up the great work!! ..xxo 💜😊
u need to clean ur sponge more because there is extar unwashed out saop or what ever u&#39;ve been using, that is in the center of the spong
correct step<br>1, pore prime<br>2, colour correct ur acne<br>3, foundation <br>4, use conceler to cover acne<br>5, use brighter conceler to highlinght

I used to struggle with acne. Cut out dairy and red meat  and it went away. Not telling you to do anything but a change in diet sometimes works




Honestly bless. I’m 31 years old and I have had various shades of bad acne since I was 15. I’ve tried everything under the sun both inner and outer and yet I can never get anything close to calm smooth skin. And it’s also extra lovely cause I am the only one in my family with such bad skin. Yay, me! Anyway I’m glad for all the acne prone beauty gurus out there that help us fellow sufferers battle the stigma and the low-self esteem. Subscribed!
As full coverage as it says it never really covers all my acne I have to pile it then I look to cakey
I tried everything.  I. Mean. Everything.  I gave up just resigned myself to acne and it was those swollen painful effers too.  I finally got relief with Murad the Essential C line.  I&#39;m telling you and others so I can hopefully save you the decades of angst.  And your makeup is impeccable.  Absolutely love your eyeshadow
Dont keep on touching your face.

Wtf;(don&#39;t do make up

Sis can u suggest me a good foundation😧?????? for my pigmentation on the face plzzz Ur make up looks stunning sis💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
hi.. i personally felt you looked way prettier without makeup .. ur beautiful.. trust me you don&#39;t need any shit on ur face. i suffered from severe acne all my life until one day a girl selling beauty products   while testing a foundation on skin asked me to go an see a homeopath. that particular day changed my life. i took homeopathy medicines for one year. didnt miss a day.. now it has been 2 yrs i left the medicines.. i dun get a single pimple on my face no matter what i eat. i thing i need to mention is i completely stopped using any foundation once i started the medicines. and now i dun need foundation any more. i have taken accutane before and after one year my acne was back so i dont advice allopathy at all. plz find a good homeopath and try it once.
You are beautiful.  Personal experience though,  going paleo cut down my acne so much and got rid of the redness from the scarring.  But that&#39;s my experience.   I do love your attitude, and as I said you are beautiful with and without make up. :)
What’s the dots in ur hair
I struggle with hormonal acne because of pcos... I get it on my jaw and neck... the scarring is bad, I have light skin and the scars on my skin is purple :(<br><br>I eat super healthy, I eat no sugar. Not even fruit, I eat no gluten or starches or carbs, I also don&#39;t eat dairy, no cheese, cream or milk or yogurt... I only eat veggies and some lean meats... I lost a lot of weight and feel amazing but my skin just WONT clear up. I DON&#39;T wear makeup at home at all, to let my skin breathe and I am at home everyday, I only go out some weekends and when I do I also try to keep my makeup light and only focus on pin point concealing my acne spots but keep the rest of my skin lightly covered... and when I get home I wash my face immediately so that my skin can breathe again.<br><br>I go for micro needling and a acne chemical peel once a month, I use a special acne facial care range, I drink vitamin A and D pills, I stay out of the sun and wear spf 50, I just keep on getting this fucking acne! I even use natural essential oil at night before bed, teatrea oil and lavender oil and rosehip as a carrier oil, only a few small drops and I only apply it on the scars that have healed, and not in broken or scabby skin.<br><br>Nothing works, I fucking hate it so much, sometimes I feel like pealing off my skin, I am past the sad and depressed part I am now in the extremely pissed part, wanting to punch myself 😔
OMG you are so beautifull even with the Acnes. I dont have Acne and I look terrible 😂. Love you 😍😘
Watching your first video. Love you already
truly admiring.
You are stunning girl!! What an inspiration!
Have you tried Aztec Indian Healing Clay? Its the best thing I&#39;ve ever used to treat &amp; clear my acne. It comes in a powder form that you mix with raw organic apple cider vinegar (i add a few drops of coconut oil too). I can&#39;t believe how clear my skin is since using it. I order it from Ebay or Amazon. I even use it as a hair treatment.
so much soof...
Where it starts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=3m00s">3:00</a>
Try colour correcting then it won&#39;t peek through because the green colour cancels redness and zits
Please do not sweat with makeup on. Take your makeup off if you&#39;re going to the gym.
Use Clean &amp; Clear Persa-gel, I had really bad break out and it helped me so much. I use to put like a face mask before going to bed... it helped clear a lot of pimples.
Girl, go to the gym with makeup on your face is bad for your skin
makeup does not suit you, makes you older. and acne problems should be treated, not painted over with Foundation. take the grass clean and infusion wipe the face 2 times a day
the reason my skins so bad is bc i would over-wash and over pick.
Try go to body shop Ask for tea trea oil . Your make up look so beautiful. I now IT might be better to not do make up for sometime try to conslntrate . I now it is hard but remember the real reason we get acne is because the skin is infected i white bacteria. Acne is a virus that is way the doctor prescribed a antibiotic for it . All you must do to kik your acne in the ass  do not feed IT .whith anyfyhing Else than what is antibakteriell  treatmemts. Ceep IT  AS clean and natural AS you can until the infeksjon Is gone .  Do not put your hands in face to offern . Do not try too use a lot of things that are most in cases try a god cleanser end lemon 🍋 can do wonders for it to drink lemon end use it as a spray whit some tea tre oil . Skub whith exoliater evry dday too
God bless you babe...you&#39;re frikin fighter!
You are beautiful!! I have a crater face :(  you don’t need make up you are beautiful!!
ur so pretty xx
You need a set of stainless comedone extractors, hun. You have many pimples that are ready to pop. Idc what others say, or what drs say, those NEED TO BE (cleaned and sterilized and) POPPED (correctly).
Bless your heart!!! Have you used Spironolactone? It worked a miracle for me along with 90 days of antibiotic! I&#39;ve never had chronic or cystic acne since!!! After all those years of having to manage it by tanning! Spiro is AWESOME!!! It&#39;s a prescription so ask your dr!
You NEED to color correct. As a makeup artist, I get brides with acne often and I spot color correct before applying foundation. You CANNOT see the acne or scarring at all. Also just suggestion. Don&#39;t put yourself down so much. Your VERY pretty. PS that&#39;s my mom in pic. JS. Lol awesome video.
I wanted to add, don&#39;t wash your face so often that you deplete your skin of oil. Your skin will only create more oil.
I struggled with acne in my teenage years. 40 years ago a sun lamp was suggested. We know what the sun does, gives us discolorations, &amp; skin cancer. I was a sun worshiper &amp; am now paying for it. I have a cancer to be removed in 1 week. I will be fine, but for all, you young girls/boys go straight to the dermatologist, forget drugstore items for acne. Get on Retin A  or oral Retin A ( Acutane ). People who don&#39;t have insurance &amp; are on medicaid, the Medicaid will pay for you to see a dermatologist &amp; pay for your meds. I am a nurse now &amp; I know Retin A, antibiotics, &amp; Acutane wil clear your acne. Good luck!
Still beautiful 😘
<b>AWFUL!</b>
Don&#39;t you think putting on make up will worsen your acne? Well I mean, that happens to me too. I don&#39;t know what to do, so I just stopped using make up and let my acne heal. 😅 just saying

how much price of this foundation plz tell me
This girl irritated me...

I will never complain about by 2, 3 acnes that come out occasionally....
You are gorgeous. Stupid acne scars. :(
Love you girl!!! This video is a huge help! Wish i have a confidence lije yours, more power!!
Still noticeable best suggestion would be to exfoliate your face daily and before bed and don&#39;t apply make up at all as make up foundation just blocks ur pours in ya face making ur acne worse and can make it spread as well ....get some acne creams use for a month or so or antibiotics from docs to help get them to go! Make up just doesn&#39;t work u can still see the acne or spots no matter how much u apply sorry not being offensive I&#39;m just advising =/ good luck
Your beauty blender is slow rising its a squishy
she needs isotretinoin
please pleaseee decrease the lighting honey. cant even see your face already. :(
If u really wanted to get rid of acne I wouldn’t put shit on ur face haha some people haha
Your Sponge is defect, beautiful 💕
Use kojic soap and centaphil cream at night. I’m so sure your acne will be gone 😊.. also, I think in my opinion that has a sensitive face, it’s the all nighter spray is actually too strong for a sensitive skin that’s why your acne is acting up
gorgeous girl. i &quot;cured&quot; my acne years ago by learning to attack the causes, (dead skin, oil, and bacteria)  exfoliate, tone, kill the bacteria (benzoyl peroxide) and moisturize it. don&#39;t wash it but once a day and pop them. i know they say not to pop them but pop them, only when they are ready to be  popped. also tanning helped to even my skin tone and kill bacteria, although long term this is not a good solution. you can use a simple scrub such as apricot scrub from the drugstore, or a cotton washcloth and soap, only every other day, over exfoliating such as every day can aggravate the skin and make redness worse. Also, i found birth control gave the oil production a slow down, don&#39;t know if you have tried it, it did help. I am not using it anymore.
Try pills. I also suffer from severe acne and my ob gyne said its hormonal imbalance now i dont have any acne. It just pimple marks that im working on 😂
a nice hot towel, ginger wash and putting a tiny bit of mint oil in the lotion you put on the areas that are the worst will help. this is along with your medicines you use for your acne. My daughter has had some bad scaring and a bit of rosatia and when she follows at least part of that routine she seems to have clearer skin and the scars soften along with a few going away. also puting msm in your lotion might help, there are online tutorials on how to do it.
they put tiny balls in most of those to help mix it up before use.
Рекомендую сначало вылечить всю пищеварительную систему.  Очистить лимфу, кровь и избавиться от паразитов (ВСЕХ) и крупных и мелких.
You should cure it. Make will just hide it but you need to cure them. Really!
I love that you are so relatable 🤣 this is soo me, after the trip to Walgreens and swiping like 5 different products and trying them all at once to see which works and covers these damn bumps the bests ugh, lol...thanks for the video!
I suggested stop putting make up on ur face
You’re so beautiful !<br>Anyone suffering from acne scars..<br>Not trying to play the dermatologist here.. i suffer from acne scars and stopped putting foundation, drink water that my body needs daily (find yours!) , use cleanser and sunblock and moisturizer, scrub my face once a week <br>And trust me. it gets better.
That kind of acne &amp; scarring has LESS to do with the condition of skin on face so much as a HUGE sign that there is INFLAMMATION somewhere else in the body....all the prescriptions and benzoperoxide in the world will not stop or help it until you find the real source!!! And to be touching all tbe open sores and filling pores can lead to dangerous infections!!
I can feel you :(, I have very deep acne scars. I dont know why It ended up like this.
K did not see you use a primer, could that be a reason the foundation did look chalky and yellow with see thru spots?
My dermatologist gave accutaine pills it was bad but that was the only medicine killed all my acne forever I’m 43 now I look like I never had them before
Did you use a primer? You said it was crusty and dry so I was wondering what primer if any you used. You&#39;re very pretty also!
I think that shade of foundation is to light you should try a darker shade and that should cover your spots better
u need some green corrector for ur skin
Me to huhu acne problem
Do you have a routine for your skin care prep before putting on makeup?
Holy shit. Girls are so lucky they can cover the acne with makeup
You are beautiful, with and without makeup. Thanks for sharing. ❤️
concentrate on your acne than these cosmetics. these products are making your skin worst... sorry but your dermatologist, I would never ever go to or recommend. Sorry.. have you ever heard of ACCUTANE??? lol
Please,don’t work out with a make up on!!!Its really bad for your skin,especially when you have serious problems with it.
Try out the tarts shape tape foundation
Long winded girl

The shape of the blender is that because cleaning product was greasy. Just wash it with baby shampoo or soap.
Y&#39;all are complaining that she doesnt use colour corrector. Shes testing the coverage of just the foundation.
I ended up using this foundation as a concealer. 😬
You are really pretty!
Dear beautiful girl. I suffer from skin problems which are not acne. I strongly suggest to try a month or so without dairy or gluten. It really helps. I use only mac foundation. Sometime I need a corrector for my hives.
U r an inspiration, beautiful inside and out!
If you have acne like that you shouldn&#39;t wear concealer like that. Who cares what people think . That makeup is just gonna make it worse.
What shade did you use?
This treatment works <b>AcneCureOnline. Com</b> go to the website and watch the video. I have been using the information for a few weeks now. My acne is completely gone now.?
where are you from? you are so beautiful.
I have kind of same type of acne scarring , I suggest you to use apple cider vinegar everyday , it works wonders , you can use clydamicin I use it too but apple cider vinegar is also very good
Hi! You might have tried this, but just Incase if you haven’t I have some acne tips or tricks! Toothpaste helps get rid of the redness, and apple cider vinegar and water can help as well. Give it like 2 weeks before making your complete and full opinion; let me know how it works! By the way you are so pretty!😊
Your poor face..😢 have you tried proactive? I&#39;ve tried it but it seems to break me out.  Did it for you?. You have beautiful bone structure. Lucky girl.
just admit, you squeeze your pimples ?! i had the same effect  and it  stayed  through 3 months! Do not touch the face ! ;) and will be good!
Hi Golden Roses good video, Girl <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23followus">#followus</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/1xKgIv9Y63Q">https://youtu.be/1xKgIv9Y63Q</a>
Girls, please please don&#39;t cover your acnes with fully makeup. Let you skin breath and recover
You should not makeup
Use primer omg
she looks so familiar. just like the girl from disney or nickleodeon.
Hey , a good recommendation is MDacne it’s and app and it tells you how many pimples you have and then you get a face wash to quare it !
you make me love myself, I’ve suffered from acne for 11 years now and I’m only seventeen.
You should use Accutane is the best for acne Google it
Man, this is why regular people wash their faces. But some peoples skin just gets like it even when they wash it. But does she even use stuff on ger acne to help it go away <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bakedacne">#bakedacne</a>

Hay you are beautiful.. but plz take medicine for acne.. my advice dnt mine
So boring
U r getting shocked on every single step as if its the first time u r applying makeup. Very annoying off topic talking
Wasting time with poor annoying comedy till <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a>
Leave your face alone
sorry you have acne. me too, but we are moveing forward not taking our skin for <a href="http://granted.my/">granted.my</a> acne is less visable but when it come is so terrible for me. mostly spriosis all over me is very painfull. stay good, feel good. you really look great.
Girl, your winged liner is hotttt! Aww your bf is a sweetie and you do look great!! Very pretty girl!
At least she has a boyfriend
a good base is really important I guess for those who go through cackyness and dryness. (foundation) .please suggest.
GGirl. I just had to comment. You have a beautiful side profile! When you turned your head i wasnt even looking at the makeup. i was looking at the shape of your head turned to the side and i was dazed
I still think you’re absolutely gorgeous and so sweet with all that acne!!! Stay confident my love!
Creo k es peor si te makillas ps si seras
She&#39;s beautiful already.. who&#39;s agree?
can’t stop laughing bcos of the sponge
But does it just make it worse to put chemicals on it? I mean in Finland acne has actual medicine from doctors to eat
She should have color corrected, but over all beautiful makeup
Hey babe I know you tried ALOT of things to make your skin better 💞 I know you’ve been going through a lot but since everyone goes through this stage (I have personally).. Try to put less makeup because it’s not gonna heal if you put a lot of makeup 💜
You look just like my favourite cousin😭 she lives really really far in italy😱😍 im not saying that coz of acnes but she kind has some things on both her cheeks but i dont think that acne, you remind me of her coz of your personality, head shape 😂 ik im weird, and also, no offence (no actually i would love to have that too) she has big lips, and since sches from my mothers side, almost all of my cousins has lips like your, btw im not trying to say they look like those people who did that kylie Jenner Challenge lol.<br><br>💖💖💖💖💖💖
I have noticed,that Maybellin foundation would reduce my acne.
Your eyelashes are gorgeous. Have you done a tutorial for them yet? If not, please do!
am i the only one that thinks she’s a squishy channel
The world says that beauty is skin deep, and many search for their identity in the middle of an environment with continuously swaying opinions. But who you are has never been defined by what the world says about you. You are not defined by your skin, your body or even your hair. You are so much more than this.<br><br>Psalm 139:13-14 (NIV)<br>&quot; [13] For you created my inmost being; you knit me together in my mother&#39;s womb. [14] I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.&quot;<br><br>You are dear not because of what you do (although that has been much), but simply because God loves you as your Creator, and He has made you fearfully and wonderfully. <br><br>God loves you! ❤️
Stop using make up ..water therapy
Does anyone know and affordable foundation I have cystic acne and I haven&#39;t found a full coverage foundation that&#39;s for oil pale af skin

Drink apple cider vinegar and prenatal vitamins....It helps wonders with skincare...
Лечиться надо,а не накладывать тонны мейкап,пудры и тональ ного крема.

Try NYX total control 😁
Oh honey,  that color is way too light for your skin color
I think the zit came from sweating because sweating is bad and it clogs up pores. Especially bc u were working out with makeup on
You are beautiful :)
That&#39;s cool I might need that when I&#39;m older
Stop using makeup it&#39;s make more acne
You are absolutely without a doubt the most beautiful person I’ve seen on here. You’re so real. I’ve struggled with cystic acne ever since I was 11. I’m 18 now and it’s still there but I appreciate your confidence. I’m in cosmetology school and some days I go without makeup. Why? Because I’m not ashamed of anything. And I’m glad to see they’re people like you out there who isn’t ashamed too. We’re all born with different ornaments. All to add to the decoration of our true beauty ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Green concealer!!
I had cystic acne both my cheeks been to my dermatologist and had to use her recommended skim care regimen...I even had scars both my cheeks and it still doesn&#39;t work at all. Until I gave up on her and tried to look for another doctor...this second dermclinic I had with does really help me their beauty consultant advised me to have diamond peeling twice a month and try to use carrot soap as my facial soap...it does help in some ways my scars lessen but still it shows - carrot soap works really fine for me. September of 2017 m niece introduced me to this aloevera gel and I find it very good as it stretches my skin...continue to research until I got into korean skin care regimen. I used Natures repulic green toner it is a pore minimizer plus their aloe vera emulsiom at night then aloe vera gel in the morning. And to my surprise Korean Skin care really works I never visit the clinic anymore 1 year already and never had any acne  breakout....natures republic thumbs up.
Accutane！！！
Well,both ways you are beautiful but i prefer you without make-up..you look so stunning..
Have u tried bye-bye blemish?
Use the color corrector first
Your acne will get worse
Love the video but I just can’t it when it takes someone 3-4 mins even to begin. Sorry to be rude but people just want to see if it works or not. Just a suggestion. Cheers
I hade the same problems as you with the foundation
I recommend to you, use a potato in your acne 😊
Eres una persona hermosa pero creo que deberias ir al dermatologo para que te vea ya que el acne es una enfermedad y deberias recibir tratamiento lo digo por que no es nada bonito sufrir de acne no sabes que hacer con ellas es desesperante lo digo por experiencia....
Me to same love you
You skin cries for help from you  to stop with any  cosmetic
&quot;Why do i look so GREEEEEN????&quot; lol that got me laughing soooo hard.... thanks for putting a smile to my face
wow I should be grateful for my skin coz I complain over the most tiniest spot I get sometimes




















any one know how much this is,, (england)
Try a shade darker and color correction...
You are prettier without make ups. I SWEAR 😘
Maybe the reason of your acne is due to make up, maybe you have allergy. No amount of make up can cover bad skin
I actually clapped my hands when I found a foundation review from someone with the same kind of acne as I have! Thanks for making this!!
I feel you 😊
The beauty blender is a squishy
Not so perfect,but beautiful 💜💜💜
I think you so brave to do these videos even though you have acne. You totally rock
On my first application I don&#39;t get impressed  but after couple of hours I really loving that Maybelline 24 HR Foundation they did really a good job, that foundation is ideal for oily skin🙂 nice vid🙂
Ur strong 💗
Good.. Nice and back subs 😘
Your so cuteee..😚😚 n I really² like u so much😂😂
to help reduce more redness i use a darker concealer before any foundation then after that proceed with my normal everyday base makeup i also have acne and although it is not as severe it still really helps also finding shades that match you skin will help getting colours too light or lighter colours in my opinion make spots or redness appear more purple
you are  beautiful lady i am giving to you advice  take  Barmacil  cream try it after 1 week you will  see result believe me
I hated this foundation and returned it. It’s very thick and drying, I have dry skin and despise powder as well. This foundation doesn’t look like it’s for your skin either. Your very pretty, try the L’Oréal pro glow, it’s got good coverage and dewy, it’s my favorite.💕
My foundation or face makeup was almost the same as urs on my Graduation day lol but thanks to the editing that the photographer did on the picture it didnt show how messed up my face was lol
So beautiful
what eyeliner do u use?
sister you try apple cider vinegar for your acne to your face and try to watch apple cider vinegar in acne before you try to put it on your face and if you just want to...

sister try your face to acne apple cider vinegar
ice cubes good for acne😊👍👍
I had very bad acne as a teenager. In college my anatomy professor said that some people&#39;s acne is caused by all the chemicals we put on our face that can irritate it. I don&#39;t put any cleansers on my face and I&#39;m careful about what moisturizer to use. All I do is exfoliate with a clean exfoliating glove. Usually foundation doesnt bother my skin. Some primers cause me breakouts so I always check reviews first and watch to see if I react to it. I tried accutane which didn&#39;t help and all kinds of other prescriptions. The only thing that stopped my breakouts was to stop putting all the stuff on my face. Might be something to try

Use color corrector to get rid of redness !!❤️❤️
Poor girl :(
Why are you holding a penis lol dislike
Yessss youre on the same things i am! Theyre the best.
U so bad girl
ان شالله يروح عنج اني كم حبايه بوجهي ومنخبله منهن 😢
You shouldn&#39;t put a make up! it can cause more irritation on your skin and worsen youre acne! God
Try the AZTEC HEALING CLAY MASK^^
I like this better than double wear
Sameeee
If you want to kill acne, just use lemon with oat as paste or cream and use this for 15 minuts and lemon clean in a great way and oats absorbs oil and skin gets healing in a wonderful way. I had this problem around 12 years ago, I was using that and never have been suffering that kind of problems with acne. GOD Bless 😊😇💗🙏
I used to have this kind of acne, i went to an obgyne and was prescribed with a birth control.. learned that i had pcos.. for just a month using birth control, my skin cleared up.., at first, i used birth control for 6 mos snd stopped, and the acne just flared up,so i went back and had to endure 3 mos just to clear it up again.. my doctor advised to only stop when i plan on getting pregnant.. 🙁
What kind of black liner is this
You should try cetaphil.. Its good 🤗
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=1m58s">1:58</a> lol
U dnt thnk soo by using this cosmetics u. R spoiling ur face more.......
Ur sponge has soap
I would have liked to know what her regular foundation is,
I have suffered acne too. Thank you for the video! ❤️
Better if u take care your face.. And without make up
People are being so rude I don’t get it. I am currently suffering from bad acne and I just got off 7 months of accutane.  In my opinion don’t comment that “she needs to go on accutane” “she needs to change her diet” bc honestly these options don’t work for all people. I still have bad acne after going on a diet and 7 months of accutane. Experience it like her and me and other people that have bad acne then comment something bc you have no right 🤷🏼‍♀️
I have terrible acne as well and at first I loved this foundation, but it made me look like an oily mess by the end of the day. It also did not sit well on my face and broke me out even more :(
😒😒😒
bought this shade hoping how green it was for you would work in my pale olive skin but to me it was straight up pink 😂😭
I love u girl. You are amazing and beautiful, it&#39;s true! Not gonna lie ❤️
Use apple cider vinegar it helps a lot😙😙
Kamu harus pergi ke dokter kulit...
Im 32 and struggled with acne since puberty ...one thing that has helped dry up my pimples fast is (tea tree oil -100%) for 15 yrs of useing tons of products n creams,  tea tree oil literally dries up a pimple over night to a couple days! Just wet a q-tip wit tea tree oil and dab it on top of the pimple....jus a tip to help out anyone here ...i use it and it works so fast..apply morning and night till its gone..i suggest only applying on the top of the breakout
I have acne and I just went to see a dermatologist and FINGERS CROSSED 🤞🏻

Hang a white sheet behind your mirror so the reflection is more white and not green.
I think you should not put foundation on the mirror or board like that. It make your skin get more pimples cause it collect bacteria.
Woahh, I dont wanna say get well soon bc thats offensive so Ill just say gluckk and I like ur vids
The acne scar is real pain in the ass, drive me nuts.<br>i had the same type red scar too, <br>But i try idian clay mask + apple cider vinegar clean it w/<br>Hot water. And before sleep use 3 cube ice, its getting better now.<br>The scar fading and not red anymore.<br><br>For me the mask just perfect healing, and affordable. <br><br>Other way from my friend, she obsessed w/ korean make up n skin care cause its lighter..
Try asking your dermotologist about Doxycycline pills! They work like magic!

Kbnykn ngmong
😍😍😍
wait doesnt washing your face get rid of acne???
Same skin as yours, I have sum of my acne in my face😭 the struggle is real😭😭😊😂.
If u wanna cover with makeup just prime color correct then use foundation
I don&#39;t like the new real technique sponge. I use to live the old one why they change the material???
Don&#39;t u think the Urban Decay spay smells soooooo weird😂
The condition of your gut dictates the condition of your skin.  Improve gut health and you correct skin problems.  Why?  The skin often tries to eliminate toxic burden that cannot be eliminated any other way but through your skin.  Anyone with skin problems should drink 1 gallon of water per day and eliminate sugar intake ENTIRELY.  Add l-glutamine to your diet to help improve gut health and take probiotics to help reduce toxin production.  Ozone water applied to infected areas several times per day is much more effective and gentler than benzoyl peroxide, which can cause premature wrinkling.  Hidden food allergies can also cause these problems.
You&#39;re not supposed to work out when you have make up on your face, Because  What&#39;s gonna happen is The make up is going to clog up your pores.






if u make up too much more acne¬¬ horrible face
Bjutufoll
You need to use Lar mer
U have a problem with picking shades. Most of the time

I know this is old but jeeezzzz so much shit about her acne and blah blah blah blah, chill tf down if you don&#39;t like it then LEAVE there&#39;s so so SO many reasons for the cause of acne she said her face is mostly scars therefore leave her alone with your recommendations on trynna &#39;help&#39; her.
have u tried the centellian24?(madeca derma) its from korea. They said its very good for acne.

queeeennnn
Awesome. Ur pretty
You are so pretty girl...dont cover your acne...its bad for your skin
i think aloe vera helps for scars! and scar removal cream, but why not try aloe :)
Your blender probably still has soap or a blender cleanser in it cause mine does that at the tip
Cutiepie
Youre beautiful ♥️♥️
Tea tree oil !!!! life saver !
So cute 😊
YOU ARE SO BEATIFUL!!!
I have a really clear skin 💕, and even if I have acne like when I saw like I was shocked u are so beautiful 💗 maybeline is one of my fav brands of makeup but too faced is my first fav ❤️
That&#39;s why your acne became worst because you used too much products to your face.Just saying
why not try colour correcting first?
Can you try the rice water routine for us? I want to see if it works!
You can try accutane they have 10mg,20mg and 40mg, try and search for it good for clearing acne , but you need to get doctors prescription first😊
Do u think the Maybelline 24hr super stay foundation or the dermacol is better to use for oily skin and cystic acne ?
You should color correct first ❤️
Girl plz use primer before applying foundation
It’s just not the right shade for you...
Thank you for making these vids!!!  Love your energy and passion.  Very informative also.  Just keep doing this. 💖💖💖
Lil Tay
Love your video ❤️
u always use lighter shade....y




im new to your channel just wanted to say your awesome and ive learned a lot from you already..your gorgeous ❤
This stuff is awful for acne prone skin. Just from looking it up and looking at the ingredients I see that it has paraffin which is comedogenic!! Screw full coverage if it can cause breakouts! People need to research.
nice review! you&#39;re  still beautiful 💙<br><br><a href="https://myadventure101.com/">https://myadventure101.com</a>
Your video was so refreshing to see especially the quality. Every time I see a make up tutorial, they always have such smooth faces and like there&#39;s no perfection. When I apply make up, I always see so many imperfections when I am looking I&#39;m looking in the mirror.  I&#39;m like am I the only one that see it? I&#39;m not saying you got imperfections but  considering you adjusted the lighting and your face in close to the camera that&#39;s what I should be seeing in the other videos because I know no one got a perfect ass skin so I felt relived to know that this is how it should look like and I wasn&#39;t just being paranoid. Because sometimes I do. I&#39;ll look so good in some mirrors and my skin looks smooth!!! and then look like shit in some mirrors!!! So basically I just wanted to say I&#39;m happy I&#39;m not the only one!!!

Girl! You should not harm your skin with any makeup, give your face a brake.
So sorry you have to go through thia everyday, but working out in make up is so not good for already irritated skin. Thats where that last blemish came from after the gym, dear. Also, the chemicals in all that make uo you use cant be helping in your acne fight. All of that sinks into, and cligs pores. Try apple cider vinegar on your face, but give your face a few days to heal honey, really. Dont wear make up for awhile. All the love ❤❤
I guess. Your skin undertone was pink and that foundation is for yellow undertone so that you look green.
I have seen some people dip their faces in cool water to stop the foundations from being cakey. Have you ever tried that? The one I saw had dry skin, but I have oily skin like you.
i think you better treat your acne first before using other foundation. Cause it may cause of getting worst of your face :( Dont get me wrong you are beautiful im just worried about you :( You had a lot of acnes and i dont think it will cover of any full coverage foundation :(
From personal experience, I&#39;ve learned to accept my skin condition (mrsa disease).. I stopped wearing coverup almost 6 years ago... Now I just occasionally do eye makeup, usually only mascara.<br>Since I stopped using coverup, my skin itself has improved. I still have mrsa breakouts, and yes, people do double takes (omg, girl walking in the store with NO MAKEUP! SHE MUST BE AN ALIEN!)
Hello, if you want you can try the miracle toner and soap from korean skincare. In 30 days you&#39;ll see the difference ♥️
Sometimes you sound like Miranda Sings. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.
You so beautiful 😍
Broo i freaking love acne like that idk why but it looks good... i have really bad acne but it doesnt make me look cute. You look nice with acne tbh 😫i wanna look that good with acne
Man its hard being a guy sometimes! No make up, no concealers, no fake lashes no weave, if you&#39;re you ugly! 😒
Hi lovely, have you tried estro block for your acne? Its better suited to hormonal acne if that is your case. It worked wonders for me. Best of luck x
try to build up application of the foundation instead of putting too much on your first app
Hi guys! I recently started an acne makeup page, Its to help each other cope and teach makeup techniques for acne. Please  help grow this group: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyAcne100/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/BeautyAcne100/</a>
the sponge tho XD
И без макияжа красива✨
You go girl! I was using makeup for coverage as well. I did not get acne/scarring until after I got in my twenties. My dad is in his 70&#39;s and he still gets acne breakouts. I am now in my 40&#39;s and now get a pimple or two, but I have scars. I go to the derm for microdermabrasion and chemical peels. They have helped me so much. I wish they had these options years ago!
Try to visit ur Dermatologist and ask her/him about the Accutane its an oral medicines! I think before u use the medicines you should have a blood chem<br>To know ur kidney and liver status, before u proceed to Accutane !<br>Why?? I used the medicine for 6months <br>I have a severe acne last 2009 but now its all clear no more visiting dermatologist since then! No more overthe counter medicines! Its 9 yrs already and no more <br>Pimples!
Why is everyone ignoring the fact how long her eyelashes are😍
I use Nivea...
Maybe you can try snail gel? For me it helps amazing against my acne!!
woahhh so glad i found you i really want to start my youtube channel but dont have the guts to make videos because of my skin problem .... :( but my husband said i should love my skin first so my skin will love me ... now im 26 but i still have scarring and the worst part is is not that red but its dark
avoid over talking
i use this fondation it&#39;s  really formidable 😘😘😘i like it
Thought I’m the only one who had issues with Real Techniques sponge, mine did the same, now I’m thinking maybe it’s not authentic
شكد تحجي 🔪🙃
Just passing by. First of all I will tell you my daughter when thru a time when her acne was really bad I tried lots of stuff expensive not expensive I tried a lot of ways to help her ..the only thing that helped my daughter  and made her skin porcelain looking  was taking birth control. .I mean iam not saying anyone should do the same iam just telling you what help my daughter 100% when the doctor mentioned it I was like what???but nothing worked n she was so depressed n some people are so rude n cruel that made her feel so bad..so I was ok and a month later it started clearing up n now it&#39;s been almost  a year n her skin is so beautiful! Not that she wasn&#39;t beautiful before but when you are young this kind of issues give you insecurities. .well she felt like that..also sweetie before the foundation if you put something called anti -redness BBcream by L&#39;Oréal it&#39;s  green but it makes a huge difference plus no need for extra coverage ..I feel it works great..I wish the best..blessings!
I understand all that struggle, I also have acne and acne scaring and also I like to cover em with makeup, and it&#39;s hard to find a good foundation hahahaha but for avoiding cakey foundation instead of spray I use aloe vera gel as primer and helps a lot and gives u a cool finish 👌🏻🙌🏻
You should&#39;ve got a darker foundation I think😘😘


Very beatifull,love!!❤<br>Uwayuuuu mbak .. jerawat.e ra ketok👍👍
You should try color correcting
my real techniques sponge holds it shape also when I&#39;ve recently cleaned it and didn&#39;t thoroughly wash out the soap. Try soaking and squeezing the water out of it repeatedly and that should do the trick!
No drug store foundation covers my acne. I don’t know how you guys do it. It’s too watery and not enough coverage for me + Cakey if I put more than I should. 😞
Those eyelashes !! Omg I want some!
I used to have vert severe acne scars on my face, my nose is almost scattered.luckily after a year of laser treatment + herbal medicine. they got better, and now nobody can find any scar on my face.
Thanks for the video..i have scars too so this was very helpful..im gonna pass on this one lol
U waste too much tym.
To be fair her acne is too red and she <b>needs</b> a corrector
Hi I am a new subbi,  I was like you before I have active acne which is make me super duper uncomfortable when I have to go out without make up on,  but then my friend recommend the product from 🇮🇩 Indonesia the brand call is BEAUTY ROSA <br>and it work really good on my face,  they have a different packet for your skin,  like a face with acne, normal, platinum, and more <br>I have using the acne package in 5 products, the acne soap, face soap, acne serum, day cream and night cream,  I recommend you to use this product because it is so amazing, I don&#39;t know how many  $ in your country  for this product but for me I am living in Hong Kong 🇭🇰 it is cost me $340 <br>I wish you can recover your acne just like me,  go girl try it, good luck <br>Ohhh yea if u are interesting and don&#39;t know where to order I will help you for that thanks
Eres muy valiente de salir en camara asi te felicito ojala algun dia se te mejores si es hormonal consulta con un medico😘😘😘😘😘😘
Hello girl.If you interested I can give you advice,how to heal the skin of the face.😊
😕
This is an example of how foundation is different on different skins and different people. My acne is not great but less severe and i actually lived this foundation. I have extremely oily skin with dry patches. I loved this video to show the difference in different people
go on acutane it helps in like 2 weeks
Gotta use green concealer before
My RT sponge is same as yours it holds its shape whenever I squeeze the water out 😭😢
I had the same acne problem, but in Mexico make a real good cream,in a month my skin change, anyway you’re soo pretty girl!!
Do more foundation videos please!! ❤️ I love watching your reviews!
Oohh.. Nooo..<br>you use lime, definitely cured acne.. 😢😢
So how you get rid your acme though? What medicines have you applied in it? Pls share ur secret..
Just found your channel and you are simply charming! Actually I like the foundation a lot.
I remember when I was young (and oily) my foundation looked better after a few hours. You are lovely!
muy blanco
Just want to share with you <br>Try to go to your gp also <br>Cause to much break outs is a sign of pcos also🙏
Youre so cute wow
Color Correct for the red
I think dermacol sat really nicely on your skin than this one
Use Proactive...best for Acne
You are very  beautiful 💗
و يسقط القناع
can i use that foundation for oily-acne prone skin? hepl me with your answer :)
Try Isotretenoin for your acne
Para calmar tu piel del acné utiliza te de manzanilla y reduce lo rojo he inflamado.
Pa sumecha
Girl  .you need to take good care of your skin.<br>i mean really.....
to much foundi. 😞😞
Try the vichy 3d derma blend! I have the same case of acne as you and itcovzred everything and doesn’t show anything
Make a skin care routine!
What lashes are you wearing!!!
Nice
Beautiful eye make up but i think the foundation does not work well on your face. Maybe you should try Makeup Forever Hd foundation
i really love how you tone down the brightness and have no filter at all so we can really see how EXACTLY it covers the redness, i love you gurl, thank you so much for thiss
Im using the benzoyl cream for 5% for my acne scars and Neutrogena face wash and Cerave i get you gurl thnx for the video helps alot beautiful💕💕
Why do you wear makeup when u have that bad acne
♥♥♥Y O U  A R E  B E A U T I F U L♥♥♥
.YOU ARE A BEAUTYYYYY
Omg, you are pretty with or without makeup! Keep on shining, and don&#39;t worry, I have acne too and it HURTS.
Thank youuuuu for trying out and showing us the foundation with NO primer :) !! Primers do help with the longevity of the product but I actually want to see how foundation hold up on their own ! :) &lt;3
Idk if someone already mentioned this in the comments but about the RT sponge!!! I noticed that if you buy one that doesn’t have the actually “RT” label on it then it’s not the same quality!
All that cheap makeup could be causing your acne. I&#39;d suggest the Au Naturale makeup line, its moderately spendy.
Honestly love the people defending her,    y’all are so amazing ❤️💕
acne doesn&#39;t make you ugly gurl:)
I’m not a doctor, but i’m pretty sure you should Stop using make up on your face dear... just for the sake of filming. 😭😭😭 try other content...
OMG..
use ponds facial wash, and put primer first. maybe stop putting make up in 1 month. Youre so beautiful girl😍
Idk but your voice is so relaxing hahah and I love watching your videos! You&#39;re so pretty girl ❤️
You are beautiful and do your make up very well! I&#39;m going to share a little bit of info about my personal cystic acne journey and maybe it will help someone on here. I get so sick of ppl saying go on Accutane or try B.C. Now the only thing that worked for me was realizing that my body was trying to let me know it was having a hard time digesting foods I was eating, even when I went dairy and meat free!!  Basically when your stomach acid is too low your body has a hard time digesting almost every food you eat and needs a little help breaking food down or you will see break outs on your face...your digestive system is trying to tell you something. My acne pretty much dried up and disappeared after I started taking betaine hcl supplements from the natural foods market in my area. You can also get them on Amazon. What they do is help raise stomach acid levels so your digestive system can break foods down easier. Its super simple and effective but not many ppl know about it so plz do your research. I take one capsule with ever meal and drink plenty of water...and I can eat breads, chocolate, and soy products again without crazy break outs. I also take an apple cider vinegar pill along side the betaine hcl to help break my food down even further for easier digestion. I also switched over to a hypoallergenic aloe Vera face wash free from perfumes and harsh chemicals. It worked for me and I hope someone sees this and decides to do some research bc my results were awesome. Acne does not make anyone any less beautiful, your digestive system is just asking for a little help. 🙌💜🌹
Her hand more beautiful than her face 🤣
just a suggestion, have you thought of trying using prime color to help with the redness, and then  full coverage foundation?  I have hyperpigmentation so I used prime color peach and then foundation. It has helped me.
Dear u can use Korean product for ur acne!!! I think that&#39;s will helpful for u!!! U r so beautiful dear!!! 😍
use dove soap for face it work good
I&#39;ve been suffering acne for 6 years it really damn fraustrating it low my confidence ,coz before I don&#39;t have it though I&#39;ve tried so many remedies, it never help I guess it&#39;s because of hormonal imbalance .those people doesn&#39;t have acne are lucky..would stop laughing to those people has it we dont love to have acne.
Use aloe Vera as a primer i love it
I suffer from acne and it fucks up m confidence just to let you know I admire you for letting us see your naturally you are still gorgeous ❤️
Hello new subscriber here 🙋 from Philippines...
Did you think about fungal acne? I also having skin problems for long time but taking skincare that doesn&#39;t &quot;Feed&quot; the fungus helps a lot!!
Maybe something on diet that will help her acne reduce.
Instantly subscribed!
I love your attitude! Your great 👍🏻
for me yeah it has a great coverage but it’s changing color into orange and i have the lightest shade..
العلاج حبيبتي اهم من مكياج
Your facee very bad
u look  crezzy
Acne responds really well to mild chemical peels, and microneedling (not at the same time)
Love your makeup video! new subscriber (:
I&#39;m having the same problem with my real techniques sponge! Thought i was the only one ahaha
OMG i use the Maybaline 24 hour foundation thank you!!!!
I can&#39;t remember the channel name but there is a way to remove acne but it will leave a few acne scars.
Wtf!
Can you please make a video showing how you do your eyeliner and false eyelashes? pleaseeeee. you’re makeup is amazing
Loved your eye makeup 😄
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
I loved the part where you took the light off your face (?) idk what you did but I saw me doing make up because all of the lighting that the YouTubers use makes everything so beautiful but when I put it on it doesn’t feel like it :/
Wish i can hide my acne behind makeup.... But boy can&#39;t do makeup 🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁🙁



































Thank you this was a real video.  I suffer with cakey foundation and find most videos don&#39;t show this so really it explains alot in my case.
the too much makeup the too much damage the skin
my sister also had really bad acne and nothing wa working she tried topical gels to so if they arent working maybe try acutane
You glow girl
Use nature republic aloe vera 92% for acne
I love you eyeliner, what is the name?
You are lovely. Inside out.
The power of makeup..😂
I suffered with acne for many years . Had all the doctors stuff . Nothing worked completely until I noticed something . Whenever I went swimming in the ocean the acne would calm down and dry up and shrink . But I never realized it was the cure . Later I used a product that is no longer on the market . It was Jergins Body wash with seaweed extract . I started to wash my face with this ,and just like when I would swim in the salt water ,all the acne would clear . The body wash was actually salty .I tasted it .. When ever I would get a blemish once and awhile I would take a dab and put it on the blemish . It would clear in just a few hours . Hope you try this and see if it works . It changed my life ......
color corrector will help to cover the scars deary . nice video
your so pretty with and without makeup😻
You’re hilarious!
You are so beautiful! Love you so much 😘
its a fake real techniques sponge
God you look so much like Malese Jow
Girl you don&#39;t need foundation you need medicine.













your gorgeous girl,
Forget about all chemical treatments. I don&#39;t know of you&#39;ve tried natural masks but if you haven&#39;t tried i can recommend you the yeast mask.(i don&#39;t know the exact word in english its &quot;maya&quot; in turkish). When you apply it regularly you will have smooth and perfect skin. I&#39;m telling you this because i watched a a video from turkish youtuber and she suffers the same she tried all creams all treatments all chemical things that dermatologists suggested but all these things could not fix her face. After that she meets the masks and do them regularly. Now she has beautiful smoot pure skin. Again i don&#39;t know if you are doing these kind of masks but if you don&#39;t stop wearing make up and try natural masks. (fruits, vegetables, oils and stuff like these) Again i recommend &quot;maya&quot; mask. Just to feel you better✌ and decrease the harmful effects of chemicals
Wayne Goss has a video aboutfoundations with sunscreen. He says you would have to wear 1 ml of product for it to actually add up to the sunscreen it says it has. So you should always wear a separate sunscreen under
Yes those new sponges are so wierd... and they aware they haven&#39;t changed them lol
you should use proactiveMD
Did she start with a moisturizer? That usually helps me when I use fast drying full coverage foundations.
Could you do a routine video for all the products you use because I have acne too and just nothing has been really working
Use betnamovate  cream it&#39;s the only things that works
Your makeup is so pretty and so are you:))
I always get pimples on the right cheek so whenever my skin is start clearing up i get new pimples and new scars fuck i am tired
Do you have any suggestions about avoiding scars? Cause it doesn&#39;t matter how much I take care of my acne my face is scaring really bad
Poor baby, this make up is just awfull
You should apply brilliant essential your acne will dissaper in 2 weeks try girl it&#39;s true proven and tested
Oh im not alone thank Gad
I do a cosmetic search on all products before I buy them.. if it has a single irritant or acne causing ingredient it’s a noo for me. I’d be careful of cerave a few products are ok but most have acne causing ingredients
The Pulsed light treatments stimulate the skin to produce oxygen, which destroys acne bacteria.<br>I hope you try it and tell me how it was. <br><br>Es muy eficaz. Te lo recomiendo 100%, no duele. <br>Lo único que deberías comprarte un protector solar para tu tipo de piel y eso sería todo el cuidado que debes llevar. <br>Mi dermatóloga no me lo mencionó. Una amiga trabaja como cosmiatra (Aesthetic Center ) y me comentó de este tratamiento, me recomendó que busque información en internet, eso hice y lo probé. Y es así como te digo que es muy muy bueno!<br>Ojalá puedas traducir esto*<br>Beso 😘🇦🇷🌸


Please  i d like to know what is the colour of fondation ? Merci beaucoup
I&#39;ll watch this and give it a like bcs you didn&#39;t put too much editing on the thumbnail
What was that foundation?? looks good for coverage, might try it.
you’re amazing
I honestly love ur channel 😍‼️ I used to suffer from acne but it’s clear bc I also had to go to the dermo but no matter what girl u are beautiful 😍‼️‼️ like omll
Try silicone or finger... 😉
very pale...maybe go for a more golden foundation
I liked how you changed the lighting for a sec to show us how you were seeing it. Thanks.
This type of foundation is made for a very specific skin type. It is for extremely oily skin with no pore problems, which means only very few women can use it with no problems. It is not sitting well on anybody&#39;s skin apart from the ones I previously mentioned. You should think of a just a little darker tone of foundation, Ivory is too pale for you.
You need to use green concealer underneath though to time down redness....otherwise pretty good cover ...👍


I really like your personality, but Just a quick suggestion, since your pores open up when you workout due to sweating shouldn&#39;t u not put on makeup?
omg i&#39;m on all of those medication you said your doc prescribed you.. it kinda worked for me ..
The sponge I think is not rinsed off well enough. Soap is still inside, you need to rinse it off. My sponge does that and all I do is rinse it a few more times until the soap comes off. It becomes perfectly fine 😊
shouldn&#39;t you do some color correction? maybe then it would work a lot better

You should color correct. It should help out on the red peeking through the foundation. I can totally relate to the feeling.
I suffered from acne since i was 11 (now i m 25) i m a medical student and i tried eveything , i went out with no makeup and i didn t like to put it ,i was scared that makeup would make the situation worse , nothing works and i m obliged to cover acne with makeup ,acne is still here and i didn t see in my case that makeup aggraved it so why wouldn i cover it ? Should i expose my skin problems to others ?
Make up will cover your acne but it will make it worse and you’ll start to put makeup everyday because it makes you feel beautiful but the truth is its making jt worse... i have a lot of pimples too. Now I’m stuch putting makeup on.. ☹️
Im suffering from pimples too, but i advice stop putting makeup, just stop... 😷 I’ve been a victim
Your video are so long 💀💀
I am not a doctor or dermatologist but I have a feeling you might have acne cuz the things you are eating and drinking. Are you eating healthy? For me sweating and gym helps w my skin.
I think the foundation was too light for your skin tone
Try the fenty foundation!!!
HOLD THE HORSE
Honey i think that color might be a little light for you, hence the green flashback from the lights. :/ But i wish you luck on your skin journey... &lt;3
you are sooo pretty
Aloe Vera overnight does wonders. It worked for me but may not work for everyone. It calmed down the redness on my face and acne. I even took before and after pictures😀 im on week 2 right now.

I also had horrible acne and scaring and still get a flare up now and then.  I found a natural mask that worked for me better than anything I bought in a bottle to reduce the redness and fade the scarring.  Very simple: nutmeg and honey, make a paste and leave on for 20 - 30 minutes.  Its messy but well worth it.  Can use up to 3 times a week.
holy shiza your gorgeous too
I LOVE U GURL
You should try rodan and Fields it will take all of the scarring and acne away and you’ll feel so much better ps...your still Beautiful
I bought this foundation just cause it was on sale so I thought why not and I&#39;m so glad I did it is the best foundation I&#39;ve ever used, but my skin is very oily compared to hers so its not so cakey and dry.
How old did you start wearing makeup?
On me, this foundation doesn&#39;t cover my redness at all
What shade did you use? I&#39;m very pale and I&#39;m afraid the lightest won&#39;t match me but your color looks super light!

I think if you color correct it’ll maybe cancel out the red
Hella pale do u not know ur shade
The sponge does that because you didn&#39;t get all of the soap out!
your confidence is amazing
Your confidence and general persona honestly really highlight a greater beauty, miss. It&#39;s lovely. You are beautiful and valuable in God&#39;s eyes and to the people who love you.<br>And your boyfriend sounds absolutely wonderful as he seems to grasp that you looking your best for yourself and him really means a lot to you and he appreciates it and showers you with these little notes and simple compliments.<br>I don&#39;t know how long you two have been together but he sounds like a gentleman. And every gentleman has his lady ;)
For everyone suggesting acne treatments; while your intentions are with love and support, I’m sure she has done her own research of dealing with her skin. She has a lot of acne on her jaw which is typically from hormonal causes and the most stubborn to treat and not as simple to find a solution for even with medical help. Beautiful with or without acne though 😊
You&#39;ll never get rid of your acnes with that color palette full of scratches and bacterias, ew.
Honey, your acne case is so severe.. go on Accutance for a 6months and be done with it.
You are so sweet  and funn to watch!! Btw your boyfriend sounds like a keeper!!!!
You the face want to viet nam give you the beautyfull new face . I love you
How did you find this compared to your experience with the dermacol foundation? x
What is colour of this foundation?
i am also  currently suffering from bad acne...my t-zone is so disgusting that sometimes i don&#39;t go out because i don&#39;t want other people to see me under such condition.
She talks too much
Cool
She never writes information or shade about the product she&#39;s using.
Well for my skin which has lots of scarring,a few acne and I&#39;m on Accutane currently..., for this kind of skin this foundation was useless/ and the surprising part is that the other foundation which is pretty famous for dry skin (maybelline fit me glow) didn&#39;t work as well.... <br>Sorry for my language but both I tried were just two sh**y foundations.
I need smooth skin now!!!
My sister asked what the best super long lasting full coverage foundation that you recommend is, one for oily skin, acne, acne scars, moles, wrinkles, forehead lines, etc and that benefits the skin?
loving the lipstick where is it from?
hoping for the best for u  and me ,, we survive together wkwkw
I think the shade of your foundation is too white.
Ew it looks horrible (not you lol you look lovely🙃) just the foundation does look horrendous 😝
I know something that makes me break out that are in some foundations which is salicylic acid so I would be aware of that. :))
I suffer from acne skin as well, so i saw online that everyone were praising this foundation and I decided to try it, but it didn&#39;t work for me either plus it oxidises so i look kinda orange... And I saw some spots more pigmented then the others after just few hours of wearing. I feel like it&#39;s moving around too much. Anyway, I enjoy your videos! You&#39;re doing a great job!
I suffer from the same type of scarring from you, and I’ve heard microdermabrasions coupled with chemical peels help fade them. If that interests you, please make a video if you choose to take that route since I’m super curious to see how it works with our type of scarring. Love you ☺️
Don’t wear makeup to the gym! That’ll make it worst!
Try rosehip oil for your skin girly😍💖it has cleared my skin and also to avoid future break outs try not working out with makeup on it can clog up your pores due to the sweat! 💕
I am so happy that you put yourself out there. I know some people can be harsh. I have some minor scaring and I&#39;m happy to see real thank you
I struggle with acne too. Had it since I was 11 and now I’m 22. Nothing helps at all. 😥
You have the brightest, most cheery personality! I know how much acne can wreck your confidence but I really admire your positive attitude and GIRL your makeup skillz are amazing! Beautiful &lt;3
Why so bright??? 😢
Omg, dat acne
Love your videos girly!!! I think maybe your sponge holds its shape because of what you use to wash it, mine used to do that too with certain soaps.
That&#39;s too light I think that&#39;s why it looks like that,  try a shade darker
Use turmuric in your face and see the difference
Finally someone who’s not afraid to show close up so we can see how the products really sits on the skin. Thank u so much!
I feel your struggle with the acne!! I took a few months off of makeup besides for events and it helped so much but I still have horrible scarring. you’re still gorgeous though!! keep making videos I love them 💜
There was a time when I couldn&#39;t even look in the mirror because of my acne. They really brought me down. I really avoided mirror that time

I need to know what colour you are in this foundation, please😭😭😂❤

i would not wear makeup when working out. let your skin breathe and excrete the sweat rather than it being trapped under the foundation
Have you tried panoxyl aquagel? I had acne caused by a reaction to biotin supplements I tried everything on the market I literally didnt go out for months I was so self conscious about it and it just seemed to never go away. Then I went to a pharmacy they gave me oanoxyl 10 aquagel and it was the ONLY thing that worked its got the benzoyl peroxide that works. The first night I slept with it on and I could feell it drying out the spots and within a week was so much better and after a month almost competely gone, I just needed to spot treat as I found a full face of it too much. The peroxide in it can bleach your pillows and bedding though so I slept on an old towel.
Looks amazing 😉
love how you’re so positive!! I’m so glad I found this channel ❤️
how are you a full time student ? where do u get money to pay for ur needs like food etc?? ( some advice )
Try the Shape Tape
Love your confidence!!! And your eyeliner game is so strong!!!
You’re so beautiful
Ew
Random, but your teeth are amazing! Do you whiten them?
she&#39;s still pretty with acne..<br> besides the video iss straight to the point and great
😀😀😀 you are funny but cute 😍
You have acne scars because your silly ass keep wearing make up.  Embrace your natural look and watch the acne disappear.  Show a sense of confidence in self Woman, the Makeup is not only deceitful but its glorified witchcraft.
You&#39;re so beautiful!!!!!!!
Have you ever tried accutane?
Drop all of the dermatologist things and use Apple cider vinegar!! It really helped my skin so much
You are so beautiful. It&#39;s nice to see someone have the courage that I wish I had to do something that I am so insecure about!


I really don&#39;t know why, but I find people with acne extremly cool looking and unique. When I was a little girl, my bro and sis had acne(they were in their teens) and I always wished to have acne. Then i got to teen years and my skin now is ultra crappy and I use accutane and cry all the time. Guess karma gets the shit.
Kako si dozvolila da im as tol&#39;ko bubuljicq
you are truly beautiful and a brave lady :) i enjoy watching your videos :)
You chose too light of a color, try 112 and put less on and build it up little by little! This foundation is bomb 👍🏼😁
Am I the only one that this oxidized sooo badly ?
That doesn&#39;t look appropriate😂😂
Where is ur boyfriend girl I need that in my life 😂
Are you able to do pore stripe with bad acne? Or is it too irritating on the skin?? <br>Your skin is looking so smooth and much better!
Have you tried dermarolling or laser treatments for your scars? I have scars except they are dark spots and I get mine done with a laser. Worked amazing. I’m a guinea pig for my moms work with my scars and stretch marks. I highly recommend it
your probs used wrong soap to clean your sponge. same thing happened to mine, I just had to rinse it out couple more times
Stop starring your videos with &quot;ooh, as u see guys, i have pretty bad acne!&quot; We all have eyes
I suffered from bad acne too when I&#39;m 13. I know how it feels. Don&#39;t give up it will get better at some point. It really is a long process...
You are beautiful! ♡
👍
Hola es mejor si en vez de aplicar la base con la biudy blender.  La apliques con la sili sponsh
It looks good the makeup
You are gorgeous and I admire your strength keep doing  what u do to take care of you
I know you&#39;ve tried a bunch for it but I had really bad acne for many years and it started going away when I started getting hydrafacials, it basically sucks out all the gunk and stuff and she used some lights and I also went on birth control. It really helped me
прасти моя дорогая девочка тебе НЕЛЬЗЯ !!! красится тебе нада лечить твою кожу.  Срочно. Буду очень рада если ты это еще и покажеш в ютюб.  С пожеланием скорейшего здоровья твоей коже.


Hy mam gud vdeo.....Doesn&#39;t all these creams affect your pimples??I felt so may be that&#39;s y it doesn&#39;t get out of ur face..Mam please do reply☺
I think what you&#39;re doing is amazing.!!!! helping people with skin disorders ( I hope that is the correct term and I&#39;m not being offensive).   Why don&#39;t you try color corrector for the red spots?? the green is suppose to eliminate red.  Does it irritate your skin more or does it just not work well enough for acne. I&#39;d love to hear your opinion.   Your make up skills are amazing continue to SLAY!!!
you&#39;re so cute &lt;3
I’m sorry you have to go through this babe. I know how hard it is...❤️ good things come to those who wait🤞🏾
What about colour correcting?

I love her optimism.. !! 💕💕💕💞💕💕💕💕💕😚😚😘😘
What colour is it?
Have you ever tried using a color corrector for the redness?
What so wrong with having acne?! 🙃 tf is wrong with you people she didn’t do it to herself obviously, thank you for the review really wanted to buy this 💕
I laughed so much seeing your sponge! On a serious note - you look beautiful and I feel like your review was honest xx
Actual tutorial starts @  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=3m00s">3:00</a>
is there a reason you dont use primer first? do you not like it?





Curology is amazing!! Completely cleared my acne!
I wonder if an illiminizing spray or primer would help this foundation? It&#39;s so dry and flat. I&#39;m not a fan.

Buy the Mario b face cleanser for $17 it got my whole face cleared up on 3 months and use the hydrocortisone cream from dollar tree in the blue box lol I swear those 2 products and everyone ask me how my face is butt face clear now? I don’t even tell em but I’m telling u so u can use those two together and you will be fine and get the Clinique yellow moisturizer in the bottle and ur good to go

Try taking off your makeup before a workout! Let your skin breathe and sweat! Then after your workout take a warm shower, letting the steam open and clean out your pores. Best feeeeellliinnnggg EVVVERRR
You are so awesome. I have really terrible skin so your product reviews and stuff are always really helpful for me XD
new sub here ! I&#39;ve been struggling with acne my whole life and I just hate when people pointing out my acne and trying to be helpful by saying &quot;oh you should try this ! you should try that ! &quot; or assume that I got acne because of whatever reason they said. everybody skins/hormones are different. and sometimes doing everything right or using the greatest skincare ever wouldn&#39;t do anything. just let me be happy with myself jeeezzzz.
Why  don&#39;t  u use  colour  corrector
Do you color correct at all? <br>I was always too scared to try it but once I did it made such a huge difference and it helped my foundation so much.


Oh wow... When the lights were on i thought &quot;oh well, is nit bad&quot; but as soon as she turned them off i was cringing.... Now i realise how different the foundations look with lights...
For anyone who has bad skin, is always tired, has anxiety, is bloated a lot, have joint pain, or anything like that.. You could have a gluten intolerance. My skin has been bad for 2 years now.. and my mom is 50% Irish (and she also has a gluten intolerance) and 80% of Irish people cannot eat gluten. So this totally gave it away that I had a gluten intolerance. If you have any of these problems I recommend a gluten free diet! :)








try to pass green concealer in the areas that you most have acne that fades and then passes to the base you will see that the spots will not appear♡ you so beautiful
I don’t have THAT much acne? My photo is OBVIOUSLY makeup 💄 🙄 😂. But I don’t have a LOT OR “just a tiny bit” I would say I have medium??? So I’m like- ALWAYS in people’s videos like this lol 😂 for REAL 😳
Wtf the sponge😂😂😂😂😂😭
Omg  turneuc powder mid honey apply to skin it get rid of the scar and spits
U inspire so many people, including me. Keep it up! Love u!
I dislike your car, but I like you ❤❤
You can always  try the Wlab CC Cushion from korea which is ecellent coverage for worst acne than what you have. Seriously, just type on you tube Wlab CC Cushion and see for yourself. Cheers!
Ignore everyone who is telling you how to treat your skin you know what you are doing and your dermatologist is helping you keep doing you girl I love your confidence and how you carry yourself
You are pretty. But I would like to suggest you to not use so many products on already ruined face. You are making it worst. Rather I would like to suggest a remedy to get rid of these acne. Just apply 1:1 proportion of honey and cinnamon every day. Leave for 15 minutes and wash off with like warm water. Trust me in a months times all will be gone. Besides this do not forget to do CTM before going to bed ( cleanse tone moisturise)<br><br>Please do not use these beauty products. They are crazily added with chemicals. <br><br>Please

You are beautiful!! ❤️
I&#39;m sorry you have acne! But it doesn&#39;t make you any less beautiful!💋♥️🦋🌹

You&#39;re beautiful 💜💜

Акне нужно лечить, а не делать макеяш от макеяжа только хуже.
Акне нужно лечить, а не делать макеяш от макеяжа только хуже.
you would never gave to get to this point and get scarred. just start to use roaccutane early as possible
Plzzzz try the huda beauty foundation it&#39;s sooo full coverage and amazing, definitely worth trying
your dermatologist prescribed you the exact same products as mine did for me! I found personally that I did not like the cereve&#39;s lotion that much because the one I had contained parabans, stung when I used it, and I felt like it clogged my pores more. I now use organic oils like organic argan oil, rosehip oil, and sometimes jojoba oils for my face and I find that it is amazing for my skin without irritation and helps heal my acne scaring SOOO much faster.


U should put green counselor before the foundation to hide the redness!
Beautiful even without make up. New subbie here. 😘
Your light is washing out everything. I cannot even see your nose.  I love watxhing your vids . i hope you can adjust the light
Omg girl..<a href="http://im.so/">im.so</a> worried about ur acne..
U should try safeguard soap ..pls....
So pretty you look like bindi Irwin
My walls are green too not kidding
how could you even go out like that? omg
Rocking that natural face &lt;3
تكثر الهدرة بزاف
Pretty lady with and without makeup 🌺
the shade of foundation seems off tooooo light
I barely leave the house because of my breakouts 😭😭😭 I feel you
You&#39;re pretty
I use a beauty blender and 2 pumps of this foundation is still too cakey and dry (on my oily skin!). I have to layer the foundation twice (use a third of a pump each time) to get a nice looking, medium coverage finish. I have some acne scars but I don&#39;t have much redness on my skin so I can get away with that.

i want recommend you elsheskin, i have same problem like you after i used it my acne much more better.
What lashes are you using here? I love the eye makeup!! 💕💕
Thank you for being real talking about makeup and acne coming from a girl with cystic acne 💖🌹
You need to have a Green concealer for acne it Will cover the redness before aplying the foundation
I&#39;ve been using White House Detox organic apple cider with lemon cinnamon and honey in it, a drop of peppermint oil which you can get at Hobby Lobby, and aloe vera burn relief equate with lidocaine it&#39;s been really helping me with my cystic acne! Just thought it might help you out or someone else
Sorry to say this, but you really need to stop using foundation on your skin especially when you are exercising.
U r looking like a white ghost 👻
It does look cakey girl, move on, lol,
It&#39;s must be really hard for you to have kind of that skin . you&#39;re so beautiful
U should put primer first then  start your makeup sweet





goos
This is my first time watching your video and i just want to say thank you, thank you a lot. The courage it must have took to film all these videos to help your viewers find the right foundation/makeup to cover the acne or scars on our faces. I suffer from acne scarring as well and i do not  like being around people unless absolutely necessary lol yet here you are, doing this in front of thousands of viewers for us all. I admire that a lot and you&#39;re beautiful! Thank you so much!
Go to a derma. They can treat your acne!
Treat your skin 1st then focus on makeup. Consistenly take vit c and drink a plenty of water. Dont take oily food and use cetaphil gentle cleanser everyday to reduce acne problem.


I recommend using a color corrector first
Better stop putting something on your face.. maybe your face is getting irritated with all that chemicals. I had a lot of acne and tried alot of antiacne products b4 and it worsten.. so i just decided to use just regular soap and it stopped. But girl u are beautiful.
Use purple color makeup to cancel red and blend then put the foundation and blend again.... maybe that&#39;s how it is
Hi Golden Roses, I&#39;ve been with acne before but as not as much as yours. What i did , I wash my face with luke warm water with facial soap like dove  soap then wash with cold water everytime. then surprisingly. My acne gone
I think u should invest more on skin care products rather than put on make up to hide ur acnes and blemishes.





Absolutely love ur Honesty about the Foundation although it works Great for me, I can Truly Appreciate you for doing these videos, so many of us deal with imperfect skin and for you to share your makeup tips and recommendations is Amazing! Definitely a New Subbie that can Relate and Appreciate 😍😍😍 Enjoyed the video and your Personality!!
My heart goes out to you I to had ance / cystic ance it was bad, my advice is keep your head up ignore the bad comments and do you!! Birth control worked for me after many many products and lots of money down the drain it came down to the pill but that was for me and not for everyone




Try not to workout wth foundation on...before u go to the gym wash it off. If u don&#39;t like to go w/out, put a light cover up as possible!☺👍
Not to be rude but Probably if you just stop using so much makeup and just let your natural face be like that. Maybe it will help. You are a pretty girl. 👍

Try the dermacol.It’s great!
stop using benzoyl peroxide and other synthetic pricey branded anti acne as they said. When I stopped benzoyl peroxide my acne got worst 10x. My face now is really almost clear. I am just using sea salt everyday as my toner. Try it and you will see a miracle.
i see people suggesting things for you to try but please stick to what your dermatologist prescribed you. You don’t want to ruin the process that you have started.


I really adore ur bright personality! 😁
I used to have acne like that...
😒


I suffered from acne when I was 13 till 23 yrs old now I am 28 and no more acne 🙏 but was a nightmare, only those that we have suffered acne we know how does it feel. (Pardon my English ain&#39;t Native one). ✌
Woa! i like your nails.
I can&#39;t find your other channel?  😭
please please please try to as best you can to get rid of your acne as early as possible, I&#39;ve had acne for a long time over 10 years... and it is really starting to scar... so best to resolve acne ASAP
The sponge done that because you put too much soap in it when you wash it babe,

Beautiful mouth! 😍😍😍
Hi, what type of eyeliner did you use in this video? Thanks
I&#39;m a new subbie😊 I like that your video is so clear (unlike the other YouTubers that looks like has a huge flash lights on their face and we cant even see the true color of the foundation😥)and so informative😍 keep posting darling😍 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23youresobeautifulinandout">#youresobeautifulinandout</a>
Please please please don&#39;t hate me for trying to help her but I have healed my extremely severe acne through following these steps . <br>1. Acne is a genetic condition so medication may help short term but possibly will come back<br>2. Use argon oil and steam your face . It&#39;s called the oil cleansing method<br>3. Try to eat a no refined sugar or flour or a low glycemic index. Eat a lot of vegetables especially kale and make carrot and sweet potatoes your staple food<br>4. Of course the obvious , drinking water, destress and don&#39;t touch your face<br>5. Don&#39;t expose your face to the sun a lot<br>I really want to help because I still suffer from acne you are incredibly inspiring that you show your bare face on camera . Acne is a big deal . 1 in 5 ppl with acne have suicidal thoughts . I really just want to help because acne has led me to being really stressed and having a low self esteem . Stay strong honey 💓💓😪
so talkative...y just proceed to the main topic? so many side comments on everything...






oh god!! i wouldn’t put makeup on all of that! doesn’t it make it worse? it looks so painful 😖 and doesn’t it sting??






its a squishy! lol its super slow rising😂
Try to use chinchanzu color red pack.its good to put a face dry..
You ARE stunning!
Hey girl 😘 Setting spray doesn’t do anything for me tbh. I use Mac Fix+ to get rid of the cakey look of my makeup and it’s my ride or die, but for longevity I rely more on a good long wearing primer, foundation, concealer, and powder 👌🏾👌🏾
I know how it feels when you have so many acne and tryna cover it with make ups! I had bad acne before and up until now i still got break outs due to the accutane...I recommend you to try the accutane it helps a lot! God bless you dahling 💅🏻
Primero podrías aplicar corrector verde para disimular el color rojo y así poder utilizar una base con menos cobertura y no paresca una máscara... el acabado es poco natural y acartonado se ve muy mal :S y con la luz del día debe verse peor..
i dont hav an acne but i do have breakouts espec wen im about to hav my period. uhm just wondering if it doesnt hurt to put all those make up on coz i get like 1 or 2 breakouts and it hurts as hell to touch it.

this is just so satisfying 😵
Hahaha u look like karylle  host in a noontime show here in ph
dude we have the same skincare routine. I’m kinda shook cause I’ve never seen anyone make a video and have the exact same skincare routine but I’m also following what my dermatologist tells me so maybe that’s why. nice video☺️
You are so brave and amazing! Fukk any haters! 👏👏👏❤❤✝✝✝♡♡♡💪💪💪💪
My real technique sponge is doing the same and it’s falling part! I just bought it.
Try luxxe white capsule
U  can use neutrogena stubborn acne👍
HOW CAN YOU ONLY HAVE 8000 SUBSCRIBERS?!   I recently discovered you and I was sure you had like at least 500k because of how good and talented you are..! You&#39;re such a big inspiration and I Love how open you are about your acne, I suffer from bad skin aswell and your videos have really helped me! Btw you are soo beautiful and you deserve so many more subscribers!
Que tono de base es porfavor me podrías decir el número o tono
Maybelle is one of the many make ups i can&#39;t us, i&#39;m have ance too...  it ruin my confidence completely, i&#39;ve tried many make up some just made it worse, One that i found  that doesn&#39;t interfere with my skin is flormar,  it not costly but my skin glows. also Vichy derma, brilliant really say an improvement in my skin.
She posted this video to show the impression she has of a foundation, not for people to suggest what she can do with her skin. Stay in your damn lanes.<br>Anyway, thank you for reviewing this foundation. I have been wanting to purchase this, but it is suppose to be a very matte foundation. My skin chages to dry and oily in the winter time, so this may not work for now, but the coverage is amazing!
Not available in the philippines
I have been suffering from acne for years but its never been really really terrible, just a week ago my acne has flared up so bad, they hurt and just pop out all at once. <br><br>I’m so emotionally drained and beyond frustrated over this rn. I spend so much money on trying out products. Changed my skin care routine many times. <br>I’m just really tired. <br>Very very tired. <br>To the point that I get paranoid that when i’m out people are like looking at my face and get grossed out by it. <br>Everytime I take off my make up - I just start to cry. It’s killing me inside. <br><br>I dont how you can still manage to be so positive despite your condition.<br>I hope I can do that too.<br><br><br>I’m so embarrassed and sooo hopeless 😩


























Steam your face! It really helps!

Hi! I can’t believe I’m just now seeing your channel, I’m in love with it. <br>I was also a late bloomer with acne. I didn’t have anything until my first year of college, and now I always have it on my chin or near my lips. If anyone has any suggestions or ideas of why that is or how I can help control it, I would LOVE to hear it.
giiiiirl what kind of eyeliner do you use? that liner is on fleeeeeeek
You’re beautiful with &amp; without makeup 💖
she is so beautiful. what&#39;s her ethnicity?
U should try using some color correcting that will do the job
I used the same thing u use the wash that you was prescribed and it dosent even work for my small acne that has no scaring ,
My sponge did that too i bought two in a pack and one would do that so i just threw it out
I am so grateful I found your channel. I struggled with acne for about three years and have really horrible scaring and really low self esteem. I wear makeup to cover up the scars, but your videos make me feel more comfortable with my appearance, and I can not tell you how grateful I am to you for putting videos out there where you wear no makeup and show people like me that it&#39;s okay to be comfortable with yourself, and that having acne/scaring doesn&#39;t make you unattractive. You&#39;re super gorgeous, an amazing person, and my new favorite youtuber &lt;3





i love you girl !
I found for this foundation, especially with breakouts and scarring is the brush first then smooth out and blend with a sponge. Works so much better that way for me!
You sounded like Miranda Sings.😊
Has anyone tried looking into oil cleansing(look videos up on youtube). Instead of chemicals irritating and drying your face. It will make your face work double due to the dryness. Look into hemp seed oil, carrot seed oil, pomogranete seed oil and rosehip oil. They are amazing for their amazing properties. I havent use a acne face cleanser in 3 weeks. I know its crazy i havent wash my face with water only with oils. And my skin looks amazing. It wouldnt hurt to  give a try😉
I had some massive acne last year and Ive found out that it is bad to workout with make up on, I advise you not to put make up on,, trust me,
I stopped going to d derma, then I had terrible acne just like urs. I cleared dem all up plus d scars by drinking raw Apple cider vinegar. I also used this as a toner by combining it with 2/3 green tea. I learned dis from BUBZBEAUTY and it&#39;s really effective! I hope I can help u as well as this has helped me. More power! :)
Guys I swear I just got free $4153_real money from this_amazing website&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<a href="http://freepplmoney.win/?ZBvKmE">freepplmoney.win/?ZBvKmE</a> Try once.
Hi so I wanted to let you know that you inspire me SO MUCH, since last year I&#39;ve been struggling with hormonal acne and I&#39;ve been feeling really down as well as my self confidence dropped, but I&#39;ve watched your videos and I get you girl, I see you being happy and not hating your looks rn but embracing it because that&#39;s who YOU are and it doesn&#39;t makes you less beautiful, it makes you beautiful because you are you, I just wanted you to know I admire your self confidence and how you are handling this situation❤️ keep slaying girl💖💖
OMG I just bought a new pack of two real technique sponges and have not opened them yet. Now you have me so scared. New subbie. Loved your video so much.
I can relate to you so much because I have pretty bad acne and acne scars and my dermatologist prescribed me the exact same things!
Please do your daily skin care routine video.. please I am also super from a acne..
You might want to use a green colour corrector on ur acne before putting ur foundation on once it’s on u can set with foundation powder these types are full coverage and it might work for u !















How&#39;d you know that you had problems with titanium dioxide? I&#39;m also suffering from adult acne
Hey dear ! Hope you are fine.. <br>I just discovered your channel today and got to know that you are suffering from acne. <br>Well , i have heard many good reviews about aztec indian healing clay mask (You can get that from amazon) <br>I have ordered it as well and gonna give it a try , do order it and try it .. I have seen many before and after pictures/ videos of that mask healing acne.<br>Hopefully it will work for you !! ❤
Girl you look great! You definately deserve more subscribers
Just found your channel. Keep posting stuff, you’re doing a great job. I have bad acne as well and I love watching reviews from people who struggle as well!
why it does not work that well on my face :(
Anyone here who has perioral dermatitis??? I have it and I need HEEEEEEELP!!! Should I use steroid creams or should I just let it be and heal by it self?
You’d make a cute rinoa heartilly :)
why don&#39;t you try acutane?? it works wonders for the face! one of my best friends had acne and acutane cleared it right up :)

you still look very beautiful!! have you tried acutane?
That sponge thing happens to me sometimes with any brands (especially when I use dish soap to clean it). If you don&#39;t rinse it reeaallyy well, that happens.
hey sweetie a little advice, get your finger off you face.. use your back of your hand to touch it or even better use tissue. <br>and let your skin breath, dont wear anything make up when you in home, you can use serum / acne medicine / cooling mask. <br>change your spons and wash your brush every month. <br>you already beautiful, dont cover your face too much. they still visible anyway (little mountains) <br>BTW you can go to skin doctor and facial only at trusted skin center (no random salon OMG)<br>DO NOT break your acne this is the basic. let doctor / skin center do it, you need the acne serum and excellent tools (some kind of electric iron in my facial place LBC,  google it).<br>good luck beautiful love you<br>source : from my own experience.
you and your boyfriend are goals, the fact that he compliments you on things that are important to you.. that&#39;s awesome!!💘
I suffer from pretty bad acne, and I&#39;ve tried something called Pises powder, and it works wonders, just thought maybe you should try giving that a go? xo
Please make a review of Aztec Indian Healing Clay for your ance pleaaase ^_^


can u do the video Huda beauty faux foundation
Try to use Luxxewhite Enhanched glutathioe
I also have acne prone skin and I&#39;m always on the search for a good foundation. This vid popped in my recommendations and I subscribed immediately. I&#39;m very excited to see your skin&#39;s progress.☺
I LOVE WATCHING YOU. I AM SO HAPPY I HAVE SOMEONE TO WATCH THAT HAS THE SAME ISSUE AS ME
hey,i&#39;m really happy that I&#39;ve found out your channel .You show the world that acne isn&#39;t the worst thing and that&#39;s right.Acne is a natural phenomenon in  teen years.Some of us have a problematic skin which is greasy,and some of us have a few pimples on face.I had this thing too but i&#39;ve suffered from it and I have only scars on my face.Scars aren&#39;t that beautiful but they show that you really can suffer it.Glad that you keep creating videos,you&#39;ll have the bright future or maybe you have it right now.Just don&#39;t forget to kick the ass to your haters.They don&#39;t know how hard it is to recover the <a href="http://face.love/">face.Love</a> you,you have a new subscriber.P.s I know that my english a little bit sucks,that&#39;s because I&#39;m from Lithuania :/
some people get acne worse than other .it&#39;s genetics and alot of products don&#39;t even work for some people ..I still think she&#39;s really pretty...😊



you go girl.. love your expression.. and you&#39;re so cute.. keep going success tuttorial dear

Im also suffering for acne now and having hard time to cover it :( i love ur video
Is it weird that I kinda have a girl crush on you lol
U r soooo beautiful 😍 first of all plz avoid useing any kind of makeup in this acne porn face when it is under treatment and if u do plz use green colour currecter to hide this redness under foundation
Hi girl😊 just noticed your eyebrows they are bet too apart.. try to make they little bit closer.. it would make your whole face lot nicer😊


EVERYONE HAVE DIFFERENT TYPE OF SKIN. I had same issue as well. I used ALOE VERA FRESH FOR A WEEK (test it for irritation or allergies reaction) it work so well for my face. I left it over night and washed my face with gentle soap (baby soap, yep, my skin is that sensitive) OR I would just leave it the whole day sometimes. My skin was more dewy, pimples/acne, textures was all so much better each day. Love ALOE VERA. It also help with oil control. Must have on my routine. Plus  DIET IS TRULLY THE NUMBER ONE FRIENEMY (dairy, greasy food and chocolate are couple of the biggest enemy of acne’s) also using the back of my thumb has help me not breaking as well so basically I can’t touch my face with my palm... or else all hell breaks loose...
Your eyes look amazing!!! AAAAA im obsessed with your videos
I found out my acne was caused by my hormones and yes I did try topical gel all different types of acne facial products and most were harsh on my skin. The final option I actually went with was “Birth control” called Tri-Sprintec and it cleared my acne in 3 months. It seems long and you have to be patient, but the results are amazing and I’ve been on it for 5 years. No oily skin, skin texture is so smooth and NO MORE ACNE 😁🙏🏼 I HIGHLY suggest looking into it
Wow that is amazing Coverage!!! Sorry if you already said, but what Brush did you use to apply this with? :) Thank you so much♥️
New subbie to your channel ! <br>I also have severe acne oily prone skin I’m with you sister
that zit was growing before you put that foundation
Use luxxewhite frontrow
Can you try the wet and wild foundation? Mines is kinda weird on my skin and it’s raved about. I have very very dry skin and it brings out a lot of dry patches I don’t even have. I’m not sure if mines is just a mistake in the company or if it’s really the foundation. I need to buy a new one because it’s too light for me anyway but before I buy a new one I want to see if it’s just mines or not. Thank you so much if you can 😘




your link to your other channel is not working.<br>I&#39;m so desperate to check out your other channel.....
its not good fro your skin to workout in makeup, on top of your sweat the foundation is justs making it worse





I don&#39;t have money to buy all these

i just bought a new real techniques sponge and it doesnt do what yours does but it&#39;s definitely not as squishy as it used to be? way more firm. And when i first wet mine, it foamed even though i only used water on it which concerned me a bit. Not sure why they changed it when it was just fine.
I’m 14 and struggled with acne for about 2-3 years and nothing ever worked to clear or cover my acne and finally when I got an electric brush and neutrogena oil free it has cleared my acne up!! I honestly could recommend this to you and everyone else because acne is the worst struggle!! Always remember you are beautiful the way you are xx




Your so beautiful ❤️
Can u update full skincare routine to get rid of active acne? I have been struggling with homornal acne. I have not found what work for me yet. Thanks
I love your positive and inspiaring personality... so beautiful from insinde and outsinde 😍♥️
You should try acnecide it really worked for me
Starts applying at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQI6xnYw2U4&amp;t=3m00s">3:00</a>















Hello I do really loved your Squishy and Beauty video you😘😍I was hoping that you will try the MARY KAY first impression and full face I do really recommend especially the skin care it is good for your skin it&#39;s healthy💕😍to make a new vide
I hate this foundation.
I recommend you using indian clay mask
I used to have acne and I was on and off accutane for about 6 years. Low dose - about 10mg. I tried doxycycline at one stage but it was actually a lot harsher than accutane on my skin and I had serious issues with sun damage - I would never recommend it over accutane. At the beginning of last year I decided I was sick of accutane and did not want to spend my life on it because I worried about my health (but my skin looked AMAZING when I was on it). I went off it and after about a month my acne returned and my oil production was absolutely out of control. I have finally found a really great brand of skincare that operates to penetrate below the epidermal layer and my skin is pretty much as good as it was when I was on accutane (although I still produce more oil than when I was on it). I definitely think it is a good idea to talk to somebody who knows a thing or two about skin care - curology sounds like a really good source for that. I know how hard it is to live with acne, it destroys confidence. But thank you for creating a YouTube channel and being so honest about it! And for being so graceful when people comment “use apple cider vinegar” or “you need to wash your face every night” - don’t you know we do that!!?? Acne is a medical condition - it ain’t linked to hygiene because I wash and moisturize my face religiously and have done so since I was in my teens! All the best for your journey and I hope you continue to create great content!




God damn all of these “dermatologist” in the comments. Keep your suggestions to yourself. She knows what she’s doing




































FYI that Maybelline foundation has a lot of ingredients that are not recommended for acne prone skin, including silicones and petrochemicals that are known to clog pores. Always check the ingredients of any products you&#39;re using!
I hate to say it but you’ll probably will have to go on accutane! Accutane saved me and my skin but it was definitely my last resort. My acne never came back! Best of luck, of course.










New subbie! You deserve more subs you’re so sweet

I didnt  like it i waste  my 8 bucks
Why are you people being assholes, you really think that she doesn&#39;t try bunch of products, you are not making it easier for her. Have some sympathy and consideration. Acne does not define us. Have a blessed day











my real techniques sponge did this as well after a while, I think it&#39;s because I sometimes used hand soap to wash it which is really hard to wash out completely... I guess it built up inside
Why don&#39;t u try rose water, Fuller&#39;s earth(multani mitti), gram flour(chickpea flour) paste<br>It is really good for skin
Maybe you could mix in some oil drops, one that works for you of course.
try the Aztec secret indian healing clay it&#39;s amazing product for acne breakouts.





Hi lovely just wondering if you have heard of demodex?  Apparently scientists have discovered most people have them but some people are more affected than others.  Many people say acne is from demodex and company&#39;s take advantage of people with acne selling them creams meds etc.
Love the video! Maybe you should use dewy foundation more and use color corrector. Just a suggestion :) Btw, subscribed! hahahahaha
Hi. Have you tried Elite 3 in 1 cream, from Korea? That&#39;s an amazing cream for acne prone skin. I use it every night, because I suffer from acne. I use Nivea as moisturizing, and after the Elite cream, and in the morning my face looks much better. I buy it on Ebay, in the store called &quot;Wonders shop&quot;, from U.S.A. Good luck!
I&#39;m so sorry about your face.that looks terrible but u really have to take care of your face.i recommend u to practice korean skincare.it&#39;s really work and helpful.i mean,u dont have to depends on makeups really much if u take care of your skin.






I use the adapalen or however you spell it too and it changed my acne for good !!
TOO MUCH talking, get to the point.


i dont know why i feel uncomfortable when people with acne touch their skin.. i feel like &quot;oh no please sanitize your hand first&quot; umm dont get me wrong, shes so beautiful btw, because i also suffered bad acne 6 yrs ago and i hate touching my face😅






OMG the struggles 😞 I feel for you but you are BEAUTIFUL even with acne and scarring 🖤 I’m 34 years old and I still deal with this to this day 😢 I had a terrible breakout 2 years ago due to a miscarriage and I did not leave the house for 3 months because it was so bad and painful and trust and believe makeup would not help and it aggravated my face so it was pointless even trying but my face is much better today “fingers crossed” and I was blessed with another baby and due April 20th with a baby boy! New sub and have a wonderful day girl 🖤































My sponge did that whenever I clean it with liquid soap (liquid baby soap, liquid dish soap etc), it’s soaking up the soap I guess? Idk. So I only clean it by rubbing it to a bar soap and it worked even better :)



YOU’RE MIRANDA SINGS WITHOUT THE VIDEO ! THE WAY YOU TALK EXACTLY SOUNDS LIKE MIRANDA SINGS
Make a video of the stuff u use for ur acne like a skin care routine
Please please please try desitin baby diaper rash cream in blue rapid relief. Im not even joking u should really give it a try aft 3 days you&#39;ll already see a diff. I really want to help you acne sufferers i regret for not trusting any more product. Do give it a chance! 💛




you&#39;re stunnnning

Loving this channel💕 keep up the good work gurl!
LOL my real techniques sponge does the same thing i was like uhh is this normal
I tried this foundation out last week and I did not like it... I felt it didn&#39;t sit on my skin nicely either... it was really patchy and made me look cakey...

tq ...its a great reveiw

very helpful!😇

v sweet

lololollololol nice
😊😊😊😊😊
Watching this in 2020 feels so trippy, this foundation came out only 5 years ago!? It’s a holy grail now
Honest review 🥰
It&#39;s one of my favorites, perfect for my skin. I&#39;ve got normal skin, although I always apply press powder after applying it then in the afternoons a little powder in the oily spots. Doesn&#39;t get too shiny, perfect for me honestly. My right foundation.
Is this foundation flashback ????
It made me look pink 😭😭
It made my skin peel, not at all good for people with eczema &amp; psorasis.
What’s her shade!
When I tried this product my face got itchy and I broke out.  My sister and cousin had the same reaction.
I bought this foundation thinking it will help with oil and it was horrible for that.
I&#39;m just waiting on a super stay review
No offense but I see most white people dont like it but I have dark oily skin and this works AMZINGLY for me and Its only 7 dollars
Is this product suit for the dry skin?
I have pretty clear skin and this stuff makes my skin look awful!!! And I’m not even trying to cover anything up it’s soooo patchy and unnatural after like 20 minutes of applying, i look 10x’s worse than I did without it which is really bad
i have a lot of flashback issues, i always looks white in pictures
Try better skin foundation awesome ❣️❣️❣️
I agree completely, I have worn this foundation for ages but it has always been so patchy and I hate that! Thank you for explaining what I couldn&#39;t understand was the cause.
catrice foundation please&lt;3
What is the best thing to use to set your makeup??
Judy let me just tell you, I am sooo thankful for you doing the photoflash test! UGH!! YAAAASSS!!! Save my life for picture day coming up!!
I have dry skin but I don&#39;t want to look &#39;glowy&#39; I want to look Matte. should I get this foundation?
please do a review of Mary Kay Matte Wear Liquid Foundation
I think you&#39;ve picked a wrong color.. even I&#39;m having a fair skin don&#39;t dare to use a natural beige color, I picked soft tan color instead for Asian skin just to fit my tone.. this foundation remind me of the old Maybelline foundation that&#39;s consider as my all time favorite, True Illusion.. sadly I discontinued from the market
pls post an updated every day make up tutorial pls!!! 😍😍😍 lovin you and your fam!
I tend to have very oily skin and I don&#39;t know what foundation to use anymore help
has anyone ever tried mixing these foundation with the fit me dewy smooth foundation? I&#39;d like to know how it works out bc i have the matte one but id like it to be just a little more dewy!
Holy crap she looks like Mariah Carey!!!!!
I have the same foundation, just in the shade 110
The foundation for me iafter like 2 to 3 minutes it would change the color and it would break on my smile line and wherever I had acne it would like cake up and it was so bad
This is just me.. It doesn&#39;t suit me at all I look horrible after applying
pretty good for $6.00 thumbs up
I hated this foundation literally no coverage and oily within 15 minutes even with powder
in australia this is $20
I was not a fan either, I have combo skin and it made me look so cakey even though I loved how light it felt on the skin.

What lipstick are you wearing? ❤️
What do you recommend for oily skin? That is affordable.
Some ppl be saying that they started braking out with this foundation, if it&#39;s dermatologist I believe it&#39;s good for an acne skin, so maybe it&#39;s something that they used other than the foundation
Does anyone else find that this foundation oxidizes a lot?
Hii Judy.. I&#39;m Deaf and cant hear and cant read lip.. I need Sub english :( I want to know what you saids.. I love Makeup
anyone find that these foundations settle into your smile lines really terribly?? all YouTubers were obsessed with this but I felt like it looks terrible on me after like 3 minutes...I&#39;m 22 so it shouldn&#39;t be giving me this many wrinkles lol










this breaks u out alot
seems like we have the sam skin tone, i also use 220. may I ask what lipcolor u are wearing?
this foundation is horrible
I love this brand and wore it for years,but always have to add a little powder because of the shine,and I don&#39;t normally have dry skin. If I&#39;m out long I have to touch up a little after maybe 3-5 hours. Now I use a setting spray that helps me to keep it on till I get home. If I&#39;m feeling hot,I don&#39;t blot nor wipe,I fan myself and everything works out ok.
If the shade that I got was 228 . Can I get to 220 to look lighter ?

i love this foundation...
So bummed out that it&#39;s $6 there, it&#39;s fricken $20 here lmao
I have really dry skin and I use the one that moisturizers your face and I love it
This foundation is terrible, I literally just subscribed to you because you were honest about it. THANKS!
I didnt like this foundation at all. Flash made me look like I had a pale face! It looked disgusting.
hate going to the drug store i never know which color to pick ugh so annoying
Have you tried the L&#39;oreal infallible Pro Matte?
누가 해석좀..
i suggest y&#39;all who have oily skin (like me) whose about to purchase this foundation, go for 2 or a shade lighter because this foundation WILL oxidise on your oily skin and if you&#39;re already wearing the same foundation shade as your skin color, the foundation will turn dull orange man, no joke!





Did you wear primer?!
DOES THIS WORK ON DRY SKIN??



I don&#39;t like the foundation either. In the morning for school my face would feel dry &amp; unnatural. And I have an oily T zone too.
My favorite foundation ever! 💞
can u make review about bounjoir mix serum foundation please??
Which pump fits this ?

Noooo you should&#39;ve used the powder on top of it .-. it would&#39;ve been amazing
I agree, this foundation sucks, but the Fit Me concealer works so great
The nyx invincible foundation
I think the &quot;oily&quot; look kind of looks good on you?? Is that weird??




Judy try it with a sponge it works better
Would that foundation be good for dry skin? I have dry skin and is in search for a good drug store foundation for dry skin....
In Australia it costs $22 dollars
I used this foundation and it is actually great on me as long as you use a good moisturizer, primer before applying the foundation and set it with a good powder
I hate this foundation so much cx big mistake purchasing this. It like makes my skin powdery looking. Stick to the dewy formula!!
which foundation would you prefer over this one and the superstay better skin ?
Hallo, I love your reviews, because you show the lasting of the products.<br>Can you please make a review on the Loreal Nude Magique and Bourjois 123 Perfect CC creams. Thank you
I have dry skin and I find this works great for me, but works better when you use primer before hand, if not you get that sweaty blochy look
Just can you do more makeup tutorials??
I would love for you to review the Milani 2 in 1 foundation.
Heyy i NEED ur opinion. Which one did u like best the maybelline fit me poreless or the maybelline dream velvet? Thanks! 
Matte Skin looks so unnatural -.- she laughed because her forehead was &quot;shining&quot;  Make-up doesn&#39;t help at all at anything....<br>I&#39;ve worn Make-up for a while. It&#39;s not good for your Skin. She has Great Skin she could go bare-Face Wtf happened to everybody D: The Girls who have Nice Skin wear a ton of make up :(  that&#39;s just sad....very sad
I personally love this foundation! Gives me a flawless look, but it is true that it does give me an oily after look.  But I still love it!!
I bought this foundation because so many people seem to praise it but it&#39;s so bad. It makes it look like I have so much make up on and if anything it makes me look super dry at first, keep in mind that I moisturize and prime, and three hours into wearing the foundation I get so so oily. Not worth it, but I already have a whole bottle so might as well finish it
i love using the dewy + smooth one with a beauty sponge for a super natural look... but its Super dewy !!!
Whatever 1st impression she makes i think she has always problems little or big..
I have been buying this kind of foundation for a couple of months. I think the bottle that I just bought will be the last. It&#39;s time to find a new foundation. It&#39;s okay, but not great. This was a fab video, though! You definitely have the best makeup videos. :)
+itsjudytime    I have normal skin and it works very well
Hi Ms Judy! Are you a Pinoy? I really love you videos and makeup reviews!
I found it shocking that you find $15 for drugstore expensive ! Drug store in Australia can hit up to $50!  That foundation here is about $20






















hi, I really appreciate  you doing the Flash test in the dark picture. I  haven&#39;t  found anyone on YouTube that does it..because that is what really counts to me that I  don&#39;t look like a Ghost in the face at night when I&#39;m taking pics..Great video, I enjoyed watching and your a very pretty  young lady!
It made me look like a grease ball lol
Hi Judy! could you please review younique touch liquid foundation?? I have seen videos of others reviewing it but they do not describe and go into details about it like you do.
Hey All! For those that are darker skinned, Indian/olive, this is for you. I am a daily user of the Revlon Colorstay Oily/Combo in shade 360 Golden Caramel. In Maybelline &#39; s Fit Me Matte &amp; Poreless the exact equivalent is 322 Warm Honey. I have pretty bad skin (as in cystic acne, large areas of acne scarring, pores you can see from 3 ft away) and I like the coverage of these 2 foundations. My skin has not broken out with this and the foundation doesn&#39;t seem to be sinking into my pores. It covers my flaws well. Don&#39;t get me wrong, with skin like mine, it&#39;s not going to be airbrushed but it&#39;s pretty good! Hope this helps! :)
Hey Judy, you haven&#39;t done a [L&#39;Oreal] Infallible review yet, have you? I&#39;m interested in the foundation (I&#39;ve tried it and 101 [lightest shade] is super white and surprisingly blotchy) but more so the powder.
The foundation is really great but when you take pictures with flash, it looks absolutely HORRIBLE! Your face will be as white as a ghost no matter which shade you are (I&#39;m tan)
foundation recommends a setting powder to be used. If you would of used the powder also, you may of had a different outcome.
i hope Maybelline products here in the Philippines is as cheap as that but it&#39;s not..
Please try the COVER FX Natural finish oil free foundation!! &lt;3
What moisturiser/primer did you use? Maybe a matte primer in your T-zone and a richer moisturiser on your dry patches might help with this formula.
I like the dewy smooth version
thank you for this because i felt the same exact way when i got it last week. my friends recommended it to me because they heard good things about it but when i tried it, my dry patches were soo flaky and the foundation looked cakey, like it was thickly sitting above my skin and it was just a really unappealing experience.
I&#39;m sand in Estée Lauder doublewear, what would I be in this ??😭
Am i the ONLY one who&#39;s annoyed by how Judy has a tendency to lean towards foundations that are usually WAY too light for her?? It irks me! Even without flash photography, I could straight away tell this shade was too light for her.
Does anybody think this foundation would work for someone with normal to dry skin but a super oily t zone ? Anyone can reply, please and thank you ! :))
I have super oily skin this foundation did a pretty good job but I think the infallible is better
More drug store foundation reviews please
I have been using the make up forever foundation for years. When I tried this out, I thought it was almost the exact same thing and I was so happy to find a dupe for the make up forever foundation ! Now I don&#39;t have to splurge 50$ and jus pay around 8$. Too bad you didn&#39;t end up liking tho ! Thanks for the honest feedback, Judy!
read good reviews on it, bought it , &amp; hated it. zero coverage looks horrible only lasts about half an hour. i gave it a chance but wasnt for me.
Can you please review maybelline dream liquid mousse thanks :)
This foundation looked good for the first hour but I looked so greasy after lol..Not a fan either!
Gorgeous
I love this foundation you need to apply little by little. I use a little and covers everything, I get many compliments on it , but it does get oily tho other than that it&#39;s perfect
I love the dewy version of this one! its nice and isnt cakey. although I hated foundation,  I only use this one for days I want nice coverage that isnt too heavy .
k
why is it that where I live, this foundation is 15$
I would have liked to see you set it with the matching powder. I think you would have got better results that way. The companies make it that way for a reason. I love your channels though :)
do you apply chapstick before videos?
This is why I like your videos. I saw a lot of good reviews for this so I went and bought this at Kroger. As soon as I put it on my face it just made me look dead. Its a really flat flat coverage and not in a good way like matte. In a way that&#39;s like lifeless  ashy flesh. I really like that you&#39;re not on the bandwagon because I am really disgusted with this foundation. Ew ew EW
yes, very accurate. i just got mine today. it looks too perfect like vampire porcelain finish. (I&#39;m very pale) it amplified my dry spots which i didn&#39;t know my forehead was so dry. i had to apply a coconut oil just to add moisture. but, my skin is mostly normal to combo.
whats on your lips? it looks beautiful!!
Ugh Judy! You&#39;re so cute!!!
I felt the exact same way about this, disappointed , I had high hopes 😕
This is my everyday foundation, and I could not agree more with everything you hit. Throughout the day, I&#39;ll see my face becoming more oily. But by the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t look like I put any foundation on at all. It almost fades to nothing. Very helpful review!
I dont care for this foundation either, it makes my skin look too matte, if that makes any sense. I only use a little bit bc a little goes a long way but I still end up looking like I put on pounds of make up. I have combo oily skin but this foundation made my skin appear dry and...flat (for lack of a better word). It covered my skin a little too well, making it appear so unnatural. I know next to nothing about make up though and was just looking for a cheap foundation to wear every now and then, so I may have applied it wrong or gotten a shade that wasn&#39;t quite right for me.
L&#39;oreal infallible 
I think that you should of got it in normal to oily.
is it better than revlon color stay foundation?
Great video :) really helpful :) so would you say you prefer the original fit me foundation for normal/dry skin over this one?
OMG thank you so much for this video you do so well in describing the foundation i was very iffy about even trying the foundation and this video is so helpful!
@***** Have you done a review for any of the Neutrogena foundations? if not can you do one? Thanks!
I recently purchased and tried this foundation in a 330 and I like it. Like she said it feels light weight, gives me good coverage although I didn&#39;t feel that it gave me an unnatural look. Before this I used Clinique stay matte in 21 cream caramel but it had an orange/red undertone that bothered me. I hated that so I needed something quick to try. This new Fit me formula for darker skin tones at least, is a good one. Its true to my skin tone at least, and doesn&#39;t try to over compensate with the orange undertone to try and hide imperfections. 
I wish I would have seen your video before I bought this foundation. It definitely leave white cast, cling to dry spots and cakey! Dry patches definitely show through out the day and wear off too soon.. 
thats too light for your skin tone
About $20 is the standard price for just about anything drugstore in New Zealand :(
BROKE ME OUTTT, HELP ? any medium-full coverage bb cream or foundation or cc? thatll stay in the pool to? wont settle into lines?
Have you tried the loreal infallible lipstick/gloss, which is similar to the rimmel kiss proof lips, and I really recommend you try it!! love ya Judy and Fam <br>it would be so awesome if you checked out my channel!!!
Did you prime your face prior? 
I liked how this felt on my skin, but it made me break out! About 4 hours after applying it, I noticed 2 pimples on my cheek area. I do have acne prone skin, but I&#39;ve never had this  type of experience with any other foundation. Not a fan :( and I was so excited to try it because I heard such great things about it. But I love your reviews!!
what product did you use for your lips ? beautiful color!
I&#39;ve used this foundation 3 times . Twice with a primer. Once without one . This foundation made me look very very oily. I think THIs foundation is really horrible for really oily skin
&quot;compared to the left side, you see the red spots all over&quot;……. judy, your skin is perfect!!!! you have no idea what it&#39;s like to have acne scars everywhere! :(((
I think that it looked good on flash though
Try the beauty blender works better than brushes I love this foundation and looks natural on me 
can you make a video on how to choose your foundation shade?
Wich lipstick are you using in this video?
This is such a terrible review. The reason why it looks too cakey because you applied way too much on the first layer. Plus it will definitely looks cakey if it is not your shade. I am a little paler than you and I used this foundation in 225 and it matches my skin tone perfectly. Tan skin is actually beautiful, I don&#39;t know why you always want your skin to look white. 
I really like it! I just have to remember that even one little dab of the foundation goes a looong way, or else my face looks caked with makeup and I look orange. 
She said next year at the end
She said next year?
It made your face look great...love it!!!
Can you please do a Loreal pro matte foundation review? 
What lipstick are you wearing?
Judy, I&#39;ve noticed you usually pick a lighter color than your skin tone. Your face is lighter than the rest of your body and you seem to always try to match foundations to your face instead of your neck.
Excelente review
Which foundation do you think it&#39;s better between the fit me matte and poreless or the cover girl 3-n-1 foundation?? 
Lip balm! Please!
I loved the coverage of this foundation. It didn&#39;t keep me from being oily, but I loved the finish and the coverage. Sadly, this foundation oxidized so bad on my skin - true color match when first applied but after a couple of minutes, the foundation and my neck were not matching. Wish I saw this before I bought it.
can you do a eyebrow tutorial please? :)
I use make guess never been good at making the right colors and i still need to find the right foundation can you help me out 
PLEASE PLEASE DO LIP CONTURE LA SPLASH FIRST IMPRESSION!!!
Can you do the lorel pro matte one plz !! 
PLEASE I beg you to do a first impression on the Loreal Infallible 24 hour foundation!! You are the only person whose first impressions I trust D: thumbs up so she can see this hopefully :) 
did judy go to beauty school????????
Can you tell me the brand of brush you use? Looking for a good new foundation brush. 
I agree with your pros and cons Judy! I have very oily skin and within and 1.5hr I&#39;m already oily and I noticed that I have to retouch every time I noticed the oiliness peeking through. 👍
I also did a first impression on this foundation,  for normal to dry skin feel free to take a look. Xoxo
Hi Judy can you make a review on Elcie foundation? A lot of the review are postive however spending $45 on a product is a bit much. Thank you!!
Have you tried the Tarte Amazonion Clay Oil Free Foundation? I saw one person say they loved it but they didn&#39;t give an in depth review.
In Belgium they put a pump on it 
What foundation do you recommend to those living in tropical areas like Philippines. Especially now that it&#39;s summer it&#39;s super hot but some needs to put makeup at work.
what brush was used when you applied the foundation
Judy what shade Mac Msf do you use?
I think you should have tried it with the setting powder
Judy [or anyone], what affordable, light to medium coverage, long lasting foundation would you recommend for oily skin? Also, what primer and powder would you wear with it? I&#39;m a teenager, and I need something to lightly cover redness, some acne, and an uneven skin tone. Thanks a million! 
That&#39;s really strange, I have super oily skin and this wore really well on me! It looked awesome for a good 5 hours which doesn&#39;t sound like a lot but on my skin it really is haha
Hey Judy! Thank you so much for the review but... What are you wearing in your lips?!! 😩💜 it&#39;s a beautiful color!<br><br>Love you gorgeous!
Should of done half w. Primer. I use the hard candy primer blue bottle shine control. Last longer oily skin kicks about 6 hours later.
Hi could you please do a review on the xo beauty brushes? :)
Makeup Geek first impressions? :D
Judy! Can you pretty please do a review on the Laneige BB cushion??
Please do a review on t he l&#39;oreal infallible pro-matte foundation! :) 
Please do a review on the Cover girl ready, set, gorgeous liquid foundation, concealer and finishing powder
@its judy time  hey judy! The name of the make up that i comment about a few days ago and asked if you could do a review on it, is called younique&#39;s touch mineral foundation. I&#39;m sorry to keep bugging about it, but I&#39;m curious about it, and would love your review on it. I really relate to you and by that I know what is worth using and what I could use for my skin as well. Anyhow if you could please do one!! I would GREATLY appreciate it!!!
I&#39;ve tried this and i love it! Even tho i lived in humid country but this product still good on me..
Anyone know what lip color she&#39;s wearing?
I have this foundation I don&#39;t really like it :(
I tried it and it made me break out. I didn&#39;t change anything else in my routine so it has to be the foundation. I stopped using it and my skin went back to normal. 
Please review the new Cover FX Custom Cover Drops please! I would love to try that foundation :)
Am I the only one who thinks that judy sometimes wheres foundation that is like way too light for her? Like in so many other videos I feel like she wears such light foundations
I got a maybelline add xD
i have this foundation and i actually really like it. i have oily/combo skin and apply it with a damp beauty blender. Coverage is great and it doesn&#39;t leave me oily at all! <br><br>A little goes a veeerryyy long way. The amount you poured on your hand is way to much for a single application. Maybe test it out again with the blender and use less product 😊 
Hi Judy, please review the NARS weightless all day luminous foundation! I&#39;m really looking forward for your opinion :D Greetings!!
The New Nars Luminous Weightless foundation is EVERYTHING!!! 
Judy can you do a review on Malani Cream to Powder Foundation?? :)
@***** can you do a side-by-side comparison of Pur Minerals pressed mineral foundation and BareMinerals loose powder foundation?
Maybelline is one of my favorite brands ever.
i love this kind of videos &lt;3
is it transferred ?
I love your videos. I really dont like this foundation personally, dont stay long and very sheer. I love estee lauder double wear thanks to you
Hi Judy, I was wondering if you have ever tried the Sephora collection?<br>I have been using SEPHORA COLLECTION 10 HR Wear Perfection Foundation<br>ITEM 1492792  SIZE 0.84 oz<br>COLOR 31 Medium Almond (Y) and COLOR 33 Walnut (N) and I really like it.There is a new foundation if you could do a comparison for me that would be great.<br>It is called    SEPHORA COLLECTIONTeint Infusion Ethereal Natural Finish FoundationThanks Nicole
Hiii Judy y don&#39;t u try menow lipsticks from EBay company plz do a review on this
I like it myself but it doesn&#39;t keep me looking matte the whole day through so I still have to blot or powder my skin about half way through the day. It can also be a bit easy to go overboard with it if you&#39;re not careful and make yourself look a bit too heavily made up so using a damp sponge is the better option to apply it.
covergirl ready set gorgeous foundation review please
This foundation makes me super greasy! It looks like you can even cook an egg on my face. Really really oily and shiny my face almost looks wet. Definently not matte
I&#39;m very curious on your opinions about the Maybelline Fit Me Dewy+smooth foundation is? (would love to see a review or mini review on it) :) I have dry skin and it seemed to act like every other foundation I have and looked somewhat &quot;cakey&quot; and more &#39;matte&#39; in a sense. Also you can tell I have makeup on and not in the nice way. Haha. Though I think within the day it looks better in the sense that it doesn&#39;t look cakey. But in my opinion not worth my money. I&#39;m curious if you anybody else had the same  experience?
⚠️JUDY⚠️!!!!!!! Can you please review the infallible pro matte foundation from loreal ?? I want to know if it&#39;s good with flash pictures so I can buy it for prom ! Please judy ! Thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️😊
Did you try the powder in that same line? If so, what did you think about it?
yes finally someone who says they didnt like it cause i am the same, everything that you said it happened to me. not the best drugstore foundation
Judy! Please do a review on your YSL Le Teint Touche Eclat!
Hey judy! Can u please do a review on the new Laura mercer silk creme oil free?? Please your reviews are the best!
Thank you for the pros and especially for the cons! I&#39;ve only heard good things on youtube, it&#39;s helpful to know about the negatives too.
Can you please do a review on the cover fx custom cover drops! 
I love this foundation actually, it&#39;s my go to. I use primer and I set it with the fit me powder foundation and it lasts all day. I also have oily combination skin. I have to blot here and there but that&#39;s normal for me. Still loved the review though. 
hi, Judy... can you review for l&#39;oreal lucent magique bb essence? i wanna know is it suitable for my skin type. my skin is combination skin to oily.
What shade is this Judy? I think you didn&#39;t mention it. Thanks
I would have to say this foundation also makes me very oily and does cling to my dry spots. I combo skin and was hoping this would work.
Hi Judy! What lip product are you wearing? 😄
hello fellow judy lovers,<br><br>I never thought I would be one of those people who try to promote their channel on other peoples channels, but I guess you do what you gotta do :P<br>I&#39;m still starting out, but I want to make relatable videos for everyone who loves makeup/needs any tips/loves watching people just ramble LOL.<br><br><br>so if you wanna check it out, by all means click my little icon/username, if not, thanks anyway :)
This foundation was just okay for me too. They didnt have a wide variety of colors on the darker spectrum so I had to mix two to get my shade. The finish was a little too flawless (as you mentioned) so I had to get used to that as well. Lastly, in person it would look semi matte but in pictures it looked super oily. Thanks for the review, glad to see someone on the same page as me! :-)
I apply it wit a beauty blender! N I luv it!! ♡♡♡
Can you do the new Eva Mendez foundation!!! You can find it at Walgreens 
I have very oily skin and I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! However, I set all foundations with a powder. But I loved the vid:)
Judy, your makeup always look on point! Would love to see your first impression/reviews on Laura Mercier&#39;s foundations
 Can you please do a get ready with me full face!!!
Does anyone know what lip color she&#39;s using in this video?
I love the colour on your lip what do you use?
@its judy time could you please do a review on this foundation that I&#39;ve been seeing coming up alot on fb, it&#39;s called (touch) I believe. Mabey you could look it up, and tell us how it is. It seems really good and has really good coverage, but I would love to see how u feel about it and if you recommend it. Ur very detailed and say everything u think and I luv that! So please could u do one on it??
It&#39;s a very good foundation if used with the fit me setting powder, but with my fast paced work setting I feel like a mess. :/ 
FINALLY!!!!!!! My pros and cons to the Maybelline Fit Me Matte foundation is up on ‪#‎itsjudytime‬ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAUeflXMkTE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAUeflXMkTE</a>




Missing your videos! Can you do a review on the loreal infallible foundation 
I need to know what lipstick you are wearing!!! ☺️
Worst dig store foundation I&#39;ve ever brought and mine was 10.99$ fucking rip off. 
Love your look! what lipstick are you wearing?
Hi, can you please do a first impression on the Loreal Infallible Pro-Matte foundation
<a href="http://gofundme.com/s4c5j24m">gofundme.com/s4c5j24m</a><br>Please help 😢
Your teeth look super white
Can you please do a review on the cover fx drops? It seems like such a cool product. Pricey, but I would love to see your review of it (:
Can you try Banila Co. CC Ccream that goes with a cake foundation?
maybe you should try it with the powder. I hear that the powder is raved about
I just hate the Maybelline Fit Me foundation line. Not worth one Penny.
Will u review the flower beauty foundation. I&#39;ve seen videos but there really old like from two years ago. Thanks ☺
It looks beautiful on you!!!!👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️
I LOOOOOVE this foundation and I am dry/combination. I never applied with a brush though, only a damp beauty blender. I usually dont even use a primer or setting powder because I am dry and powder just doesnt sit well on my skin. But I love how it blurs out my pores and covers my discoloration. I really do love it! I also love the &quot;dewey and smooth&quot; version too. Its not the same as the original fit me like some people claim. The matte and poreless and dewey smooth foundations actually work really well for me! Which is odd because I am very very picky with foundations and usually they dont sit as well as I would like them too, but these do! I would suggest everyone trying both versions using a damp beauty blender. Theyre holy grail for me!
Hate this foundation. I don&#39;t have dry patches literally anywhere on my body so i didn&#39;t have the clingy problem but if I didn&#39;t set it with powder it felt so sticky and gross. And I was oily within 1 hr. Revlon whipped foundation has been the only thing to work for me!
I use the original formula (not the matte and poreless) in 115. I love the original formula! It does not fade and it does not crease or cake up. I also use a round top brush.
Judy what lipstick are you wearing on this vid pretty pls ❤️
I LOVE this foundation! Probably my favorite drugstore thus far. However, I do use Too Faced Hangover Rx Primer and Smashbox primer prior to putting it on followed by the Fit Me Foundation Powder and Urban Decay Setting Spray after application. Primers and setting powders really help with looking oily and keeps the makeup lasting.
can you do a nyx primer review pleaseeeee. the shine killer and pore filler.. to see which one is better for a flawless look :) 
Can you do an everyday makeup routine? For the makeup you&#39;ve been wearing in your vlogs? :)
Can you do a makeup tutorial of this look?! You look so pretty!
She always puts on sooo much product on, which is probably why it looks cakey and her skin gets oily. 
Wear a primer with it next time. I recommend Dr. Brandt Pore No More primer. Those two together work amazing!!!! 
Sephor has oil blotting paper. You should try it out:) it doesn&#39;t take off makeup just oil I believe it&#39;s the blue packaging that people like best. Hope this helps :)
Can you please do a tutprial about how you changed uour eyebrow shape??? You look so different in a good way and I&#39;d like to know how!!!
I have this foundation but for dry skin and I give it the same review. It&#39;s absolutely worth the price. It always gets really oily and feels like it never sets. It&#39;s really horrible 
Cover FX Custom Cover Drops first impression!! Or... Becca Ultimate Coverage Complexion Creme :) 
So many mixed reviews on this foundation. I am so intrigued and I will definitely have to try it for myself! 
What lip color are you wearing? I LOVE ITTTTT
I love the foundation on myself. It works great, I barely get oily even though I have oily combination skin. 
This is my holy grail foundation. I use a beauty blender and 2 thin layers. Have been adding a facial oil to it as well(wayne goss tip) and stays on all day( yes, being oily combo I have to blot and powder through out the day like with all foundations)
Will you review the Maybelline Fit Me Dewy foundation?
Hi Judy can you do review of georgio armaani luminess silk foundation? Thanks
I know this is off topic but you really look like Yewon, Judy.
Thank you for the review.  Would you say this foundation is comparable to the loreal true match foundation?  
If you picked a color that matched your skin better (was a little darker) it might not have looked like so much makeup.
It oxidizes <br>I recommend getting a lighter shade
@***** I actually love this foundation!! I apply it with a beauty blender and set it with powder. I would say it gives me a natural finish.
its not matte and poreless bec just after 2-3hrs of applying it i got really oily and i dont think it hides my pores.plus i dont know if its just me but i think this foundation oxidize bec after a few hrs it gets darker on my skin.:( 
Ladies with dry skin- I swear by the original FitMe formula. It looks natural and does not emphasize the dry patches :) 
i love this foundation i wear porcelain fits me perfect cause it super hard for me to find a light enough color and i use a beauty blender btw you look great with this foundation
what brush does she use to buff?
Judy why don&#39;t you wear Chapstick!?
Judy I love you !!! Thank you for uploading these video ! 💕💕 I can watch your videos everyday 
I hated it with a brush, but loved it with a beauty blender!
Please do a review on loreal infallible pro matte foundation! Xx
Kind of weird though cause first she said it looked natural and then later she said it doesn&#39;t look natural at all xD
What lipstick are you wearing?
I love this foundation. I dab it all over my face with my finger then spread it a little with my fingers. And even it out with a damp beauty blender. It is my new favorite foundation. It does not apply well with a brush and is best used with a Beauty blender. I dab any extra over trouble spots I want to cover and blend that out as well for best coverage.
Please blot and take away the oil first and then powder. Blot with blotting paper or a tissue and the use a brush or puff to reapply powder because putting powder on your puff and directly on top of the oil will cause the bacteria to be on the puff. And then you put the put back in the powder to get more which transfers bacteria on the powder itself and your face. 
Can do a NARS Luminous long wear foundation review
I have combo oily skin and I hated this foundation. Oil seeped through way too fast, was patchy, and accentuated my pores. I love the loreal pro matte foundation better. It costs almost double than the fit me but totally worth it. 
review l&#39;oreal lucent magique bb essence
Hey Judy can you review the other fit me products and also their other concealer the master one? There is a concealer for both the fit me one and than the master conceal. They say the fit me foundation works best with the fit me powder, and also better applied with a damp beauty blender especially with combo skin because it does cling to dryness
Thanks for a great review! I tried this foundation, and it didn&#39;t work for me either. I&#39;m super oily, and within the first hour, it was already breaking apart. Nothing tops my Revlon Colorstay.. Lol 😊❤️
You recorded it April 1st? Wow.
Yeah, beauty blender and the translucent powder that goes with it should fix your problems. (:
I seriously don&#39;t feel like I have a problem with this foundation and no lie it&#39;s one of my faves! I&#39;m also really oily around my tzone area but I blotch .. I also heard that if you use the original and this matte and poreless that it gives you a pretty dewy finish.. Haven&#39;t tried that yet but I honestly love this foundation :)
So true! I wish I had seen this video, before I bought this foundation. 👎👎<br>
Could you do one on the new NARS foundation ? X
You seriously have the BEST foundation reviews!! Can you please do nars all day luminous and loreal infallible foundation. Review!!😍
Dang it! I was just thinking about buying this too! Well it&#39;s good to know! Thanks!
I love this foundation! It clings to dry patches with a brush but when you use a beauty blender... Perfection. :D
Just saying, the MAC foundation pump (you can buy it alone for $10) fits this foundation! It locks too, so you don&#39;t have to worry about going capless. 
I have very dry skin &amp; I use this foundation just bc the formula for dry skin is dewy which I don&#39;t like. Also it looks very natural on me, maybe because I apply it with a beauty blender? I don&#39;t know! This foundation doesn&#39;t cling to my dry patches so everyone&#39;s skin is different! In my opinion it is definitely worth a try. (:
Hi Judy, love this review video! can you do a review for Laniege pore control bb cushion? I&#39;ve used the previous version when it first launched in Singapore but it didn&#39;t last for my oily combination skin - now it has the pore control n long lasting one, I&#39;m hesitant to buy it. Please help to review! Thanks! 
Please do a makeup tutorial for prom, mine is next week and I need ideas. Also other viewers, if you have any suggestions please tell me. I&#39;m wearing a pale yellow dress almost easter yellow. Thank you!!!!
I love this foundation it&#39;s my favorite especially now with the new matte formula. I love that it&#39;s lightweight
Thanks for the review, Judy! Can you please do a review on Loreal&#39;s infallible pro-matte?
I&#39;m waiting on the Infallible first impression! !!!! Please do one♡
Judy, please do a 1st Impression on the Covergirl Ready,Set,Gorgeous Foundation
$15 or $20 for a drugstore foundation?! Which drugstore are you shopping at? lol I&#39;ve never seen one for $20 anywhere lol
Judy, I have worn this foundation twice and like it a lot.  I apply it with the real technique sponge and it gives a flawless finish.  Try using a different tool to blend it and see if there is a difference.  I do really like this foundation because of the matte finish but I do get a little oily after 4 hrs+.  I do set my T zone as well, but will need touch up throughout the day.  Thanks for your review, I love them!!!
I think this foundation would&#39;ve worked so much better for you if it had been set with powder. I have normal/slightly dry skin &amp; I always set with powder. I love this foundation. I wear it over a good moisturizer, apply with a beauty blender, &amp; lightly set it with translucent powder. Also, when you start to get oily, don&#39;t go straight in with powder. Blot away the excess oil first with tissue or blotting papers, then apply a light amount of powder to reset the foundation. Going straight in with powder creates cake face because the oil &amp; powder mix. Hope this helps!
I just bought this foundation yesterday because I was out and I wore it to work today for the first time. I hate it!  I have very oily skin and by the second hour the foundation had me looking an oily mess! Once my shift was over at work it looked like I never put any foundation on, it slid right off my skin into a oil slick.  Fit Me foundation never works for me. I&#39;m so mad I wasted my money. 
Dang gurl your teeth are white! I don&#39;t know if anyone else notices but they just look a lot whiter than before! What are you using? Huge hugs! Love your reviews! XoJenna
I had the same problem when I used it with a brush application. It works a lot better with a beauty blender. Also, I set my t zone and my under eye with Laura mercier translucent powder. :)
Hmmm interesting. I actually loved this foundation and I have oily skin as well. When i set it with a powder it stays matte all day and looks flawless. Maybe its the powder im using im not sure but i was very impressed with this foundation. I feel like its a staple next to my beloved Revlon Colorstay :) glad to know your thoughts on it! 
Hi Judy, can you review the georgio armaani luminess silk foundation? Thanks
i loved this foundation when i first applied it but it always ended up melting off my face. i couldnt even get through a full day....disappointing. especially since it claims to be matte
I think the best way to apply the foundation is with a beauty blender because of the moisture of the sponge sheers it out and that way it doesn&#39;t cling on to dry patches
I love this foundation!
Hi judy... love all ur reviews...<br><br>Can u please review the new cover fx cover drops. It has good reviews but havent seen antone review it on youtube.<br><br>Thank u<br>GG xo :)
i had the same issues with this foundation
I actually really love this foundation. I have combination skin so it never gets super oily on me. I love the coverage and how nice it blend out. 

Great review! <br>Could you maybe do the new L&#39;oreal Infallible Matte Foundation? I&#39;m interested if its similar to this one! :)
Hi Judy!! ur face looks good already, u don&#39;t need to put a lot of foundation. 
can you do a video on how to pick out the perfect shade on drugstore foundations please an thank you btw what do you do with all the foundations you have done a review on just curious
This foundation definitely is not a thicker foundation lol... It pours right out the bottle and will drip down your hand. You put way too much on and you&#39;re supposed to use the fit me powder with it to help control oil. I use this foundation everyday and it definitely looks light and natural when you start out with a small amount!
In Norway a drugstore fundation is 30 dollars...

If you pair this foundation with a setting spray it&#39;s perfect! 
I actually have been using this foundation for two weeks and I love it it&#39;s very humid in md and I did notice a little oil but not too much. The foundation lasts and looks beautiful. I also use a primer and the fit me mystifying powder to set the foundation so maybe that&#39;s why.
I have dry/normal skin, and it made my skin look patchy. It clung to the dry areas, but was okay with the normal areas. If you have that rare, normal skin, this foundation is for you; but if you have dry or oily skin, just say no.
use a beauty blender and a primer! makes a world of difference. This is my go to foundation,it has lasted 13 hours on me
NARS All Day Luminous Weightless Foundation

Can u do a prom look? xx
Please review the new Laura Mercier silk cream foundation. They relaunched it. 
YOUR SKIN LOOKS SO FAB LATELY. What are you using?! <br><br>&amp; Have you tired the Loreal Pro Matte?! OMG! You would LOVE it! We both have the OILY OILY skin. &amp; it replaced my MUFE Mat Velvet hehe. &lt;3 LOVE YOU JUDY!
uhmmm this ins&#39;t for oily skin  like mine  :(
Hi Judy &amp; Everyone! I am a new Youtube doing Beauty, Fashion &amp; Lifestyle. I just Uploaded my 1st video so please show some support and I will appreciate very much! :) Thank you!! Do follow me on Instagram and Twitter at @imanney
Please do a review on the L&#39;Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte Foundation!!!
drugstore prom makeup! i would love a video on that :)
I don&#39;t love it, but if I use it mixed with a good moisturizer it works as a tinted moisturizer on my light &quot;no makeup&quot; days.
it is my go to foundation. I mix it with L&#39;oreal Magic Lumi to cut down on how matte it really is. A little product goes a long way. I agree with these ladies when they say to use your beauty blender. I notice the coverage is great and it holds better when using the blender as opposed to the flat top kabuki. If you must use a brush i suggest you try something like a stippling brush to give you a similar finish to the blender sponge.
Too light
Judy! Thank you for the review! I was waiting for this!
More first impressions please Judy!!
Well first you didn&#39;t use any primer,second you didn&#39;t set it with nothing either,so Maybie do a video without skipping those steps,and keep us updated Judy.
I agree with all the cons! I have it but i wear 115 and it never lasts 8 hours it&#39;s very blotchy and I look super oily after 2 hours after I apply it 
Judy what foundation do you use??? if that is not to mucho to ask...... thanks☺
I think the color looks a bit too light for you. 
Can you do a review about l&#39;oreal infallible foundation Please!!! cant wait to see a review about that from you!! &lt;3 your awesome! =)
I completely agree, I bought this for oil control, wanting to find a drugstore alternative to my Laura Mercier foundation, but after an hour or two of wearing this foundation (even setting it with a powder) I get really oily around my t zone. I did not like it at all 
I kept waiting for your review on this because I just love watching them  before I go buy something new!lol But anywhoo I couldn&#39;t wait any longer and I purchased it about a month back with the powder and I must say I wanted to LOVE it but like you mentioned I got sooooo oily around my t-zone which is so weird because it claims to be &quot;matte&quot;!?? BTW I have oily/combo skin oooo well back to my Revlon Colorstay !! &lt;3
Can you please do clinique beyond perfecting foundation next? :)
Hmm, it&#39;s been my go to foundation as of lately! It&#39;s very pore refining and smoothing on the skin. It looks like great skin and it&#39;s light weight.  I don&#39;t put as much as Judy put  in the demo. I dot it over my face and then blend with a stippling brush.  I&#39;ve been using the Rimmel Stay Matte primer. There&#39;s slight blotchiness by the end of the day, but by that time, it&#39;s time to take off my makeup. It lasts a good 7-8 hours on me.  I still have to slightly blot my nose but my forehead about 4-5 hours in, but cheeks and chin are good to go.  I&#39;ve been using it in all of my tutorials in the last two months since I got it. It&#39;s a good, everyday foundation for those who like light to medium coverage. Hope that helps!
I just realize that itsjudytime palete is on lič<a href="http://ila.si">ila.si</a> that is Slovenian make up side and I live in slovenia soo I can buy IT 😍👌🏼😱❤️ love you Judy 💙
I agree with your review Judy, it clings really badly to dry patches and has no staying power. Can you please review the new Nars foundation!! thanks @*****
There are two different versions of this foundation. There is one for dewy + smooth and matte + pore less. I tried both foundations. I have oily skin and I&#39;m dry around my nose, and forehead. I used the dewy + smooth version in the shade 220 and I didnt like it. I thought it looked unnatural, but it was okay because i didn&#39;t have the correct shade. 220 was too light for me. Then, I got the matte + poreless foundation and got it in the shade 228. Hands down, the BEST foundation for me. I LOVE IT. It looks super natural, and it doesn&#39;t crease. It has medium to full coverage. I use the real techniques buffing brush. I think the reason Judy&#39;s review wasn&#39;t so accurate was because on the day to day basis, you would moisturize and use primer, then set it with powder, but Judy didn&#39;t. I never really comment on videos, but I had to for this one! I&#39;ve tried about 10 foundations and maybelline&#39;s fit me Matte + poreless is my absolute favorite! 
A lot of people commenting on here have far too much to say for themselves. Didn&#39;t your mothers ever teach you &quot; if you don&#39;t have anything nice to say, don&#39;t say anything at all&quot; <br>
I thought it was just me! This foundation makes my oils come out all day long! I was such a grease bomb!!! It is so Not matte!!! Same opinion as Judy for this one!
I like how you did the pros and cons at the end 😊 
I hated this when I first bought it 1 month ago but I refused to give up on it.  So, I mixed the regular fit me on my perimeter and put the matte in the t-zone. Used the setting powder that&#39;s for the matte and bingo!!!!!! Love it now 
You are my favorite go to for foundation reviews! Wish you did more but I understand you&#39;re busy with 3 babies. 
Please do a review on l&#39;oreal infalliable pro matte foundation.
 I&#39;ve been waiting for you to do a review on this foundation. ☺️
I was not a fan of this foundation. I have dry/acne prone skin and this foundation really emphasized my dry spots and acne. I much prefer the dewy version.
Finally you have succesfully finished this review!! Yayy haha. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ifyouknowwhatimean">#ifyouknowwhatimean</a> :)) <br><br>Ps: please dont use papyrus as font. That&#39;s the most unappealing font ever created :(
I bought this foundation a while ago and had some of the same problems. I thought the coverage was nice but my skin is very oily and I was expecting to have very little oil during the day but I turned out being VERY oily from this foundation!
Can you please do a review on Cover FX Cover Drops? Thanks!
The fit me foundation is on sale at ulta today for like 4$ 
I had pretty much the same experience. I wanted to like it, but it didn&#39;t hold up for me
I had the same problem with this foundation wasnt matte didnt control my oils after applying i notice my T zone getting oily and it did cling to my dry patches i thought it was just me finally someone else has had the same problems thanks judy
judy can you copare the both fit me foundation
I love when foundations doesn&#39;t have a scent. I feel like I&#39;m putting something toxic on my face if it&#39;s scented, lol. &gt;_&gt; idk if it&#39;s just me.
Try the new Loreal infallible please <br>
I think it looks great, Judy. I will definitely try this product.
Please review some new BB creams! I want to wear foundation but it&#39;s too thick for my skin and I just hate the feel of it
I did a first impression and review on my channel as well-- I have oily skin and this end up breaking down and being so greasy it was CRAZY! Check out that video
Try the powder! I use it as a setting powder than use a makeup spray on top. I have uber oily skin, it looks amazing and stays put all day long! It&#39;s my staple now :)
Judy can you please do a challenge with benji it would be so funny 
i don&#39;t mind this foundation. i like the coverage it gives me and that it blurs my pores, but i totally agree with you on the fact that it&#39;s not matte and that it doesn&#39;t control the oil seeping through my skin after a few hours. i can&#39;t vouch for whitecast in pictures bc i haven&#39;t purposely taken pictures of me with it on. i&#39;m still testing which will be my favorite foundation - i like my mac studio fix fluid and kat von d tattoo foundation, but i want to try UD&#39;s naked foundation and the new nars one, but it&#39;s not budget friendly at the moment lol. thanks for sharing your thoughts on this foundation
$6?! i wish our foundations were that cheap here in sydney. :( our foundations range from $15-$30+ and thats drug store too. the high end brands range from $30-$100+
More first impressions
The L&#39;Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte foundation is tons better, in my opinion! I have pretty oily skin, and I can go the whole day without blotting with that one! Plus, it feels so smooth on the skin and has great coverage! I highly recommend it! 
I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t pick this up the other day! Nice price though. 
The ones here do have a pump! 
please try the new loreal infallible 24 mat, thanks!
What are your favorite brushes and how do you clean them?
Have been using it for over 2 months. It isn&#39;t my favorite, but I have to finish it! I live in Puerto Rico (tropical &amp; humid weather), so my skin is pretty oily. This foundation doesn&#39;t cover my expectations. I like that it really minimizes pores, but on the matte part... Not so much! It can cover blemishes and all, also like that part. But for me, it&#39;s a 1 time purchase. Thanks for the review!!!
U shud try #230 it might match u better. 
You need to use the fit me matte powder too!
can you do a review on the maybelline fit me concealer?
you look better without make up ^_^ :)))
I died a little inside when you said it was $6.. try $19 in australia! :&#39;( :&#39;( hahaha.. and that&#39;s pretty cheap compared to others!!<br>Awesome review though! thank you!! :D
yep, didn&#39;t help me with oil control either :(

Do a video on what&#39;s on my phone ! 
Americans have it so hard with $15 foundations. In the uk that&#39;s like a typical price (around £10)
your reviews are always my favourite! 
@***** Seriously, you don&#39;t look oily, you look like you&#39;re glowing &lt;3
Please do a review on the Covergirl Outlast Stay Fabulous 3 in 1!!! ...I was using the fit me matte before I found the COSF foundation &amp; I absolutely LOVE it! I have oily/combo skin &amp; it holds up pretty well for me. . .or could you possibly do a water based vs oil based foundation &amp; what water/oil based powders go well with one another? Please:) xoxo to you!
Omg judy what lipstick are u using? It looks nice on u (:
We don&#39;t have the fit me matte here in germany but the regular fit me foundation and this one comes with a pump! I&#39;m surprised that this isn&#39;t the case in the US. Thanks for the review anyway, Judy!
another con is no pump :/ just waiting for an accident to happen lol
Hi Judy. This is off subject from this video but when will you be doing your favorite Mac blush palette video. I&#39;ve been waiting.  Thanks!!
I have extremely oily skin and this stuff works, iset it with the fit me powder and use a beauty blender. Its awesome and affordable! Its been out forever though lol late much...
Please do a reveiw on memebox which is korean or could u do a review on ysl new lip gloss
 Can you do the loreal Matte foundation ..?? please 
I don&#39;t really like this foundation. I get oily quickly with this it and it looks very unnatural.
I really appreciate these videos! Nice work👍🏿
This is my favorite of all foundations but I do use the powder that goes with it and less is more when you combine them
Totally agree!!! For all the same reasons!!! To top it off it broke me out and burned my skin :&#39;(
