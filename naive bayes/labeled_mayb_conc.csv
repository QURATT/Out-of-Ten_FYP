Im a little annoyed with this product Ive used this concealer for years  its a great product However I ordered the color associated with shade 10 because Ive always used shade 10 If you look at the advertised picture of shade 10 it shows 10 light but the REAL shade 10 is fair I didnt realize this until I received the product I ordered shade 10 light but what I received is shade 15 light Maybe this is partially my fault  I should have went by the shade name instead of the shade number but I assumed ordering by the shade number would bring me the accurate product I can and will reorder the right color just be aware of the flip flop of these 2 shades when ordering this product,0.065,0.064,0.871,-0.2272,Negative

This is a pretty good concealer but it isnt going to be mistaken for a high end product if you look closely  The concealer works best if you have moisturized skin primer on and no wrinkles  If you put in on dry skin or on crows feet it will bring attention to them not hide themI use this under my eyes with lots of primer base and it lasts a good 8 hours  I also use this on some redness or blemishes and it works fine  For the price Id say that this is 2 to my 1 Elfs Camo Concealer  Still a good item to have in your workplace makeup bag for quick spot retouches,0.17,0.048,0.782,0.938,Positive
Usually when I get concealer it never works out Either it doesnt blend it looks bad and dry or its just not my shadecolor This one was pretty good I general bought it because I couldnt find any that fit me and I was going to use it for SFX things if it didnt work I now use it for my everyday makeup ,0.13,0.053,0.817,0.6249,Positive
If I were to apply only one beauty product before leaving the house it would be concealer  My undereyes and my eyelids are so prone to dark shadowyness that I swear it looks like I have a penchant for punching myself in the face as part of my morning routine  If I want to run down the street in the morning to grab a coffee I either need to put on concealer or wear sunglasses or I fear that small children will run away from me screaming in terror convinced that they just saw a real life zombie coming out of their local StarbucksAs a result of my unrelenting dark circles concealer and I have a very intimate relationship  I swear that I have tried EVERY concealer and eye brightener that any magazine beauty blog or friend has ever recommended  YSL Touche Eclat Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage Lancome Effacernes Benefit Boiing Smashbox Photo Op Bobbi Brown Clinique Tarteokay Im going to stop naming concealers Ive tried because this is actually getting really depressing and kind of shameful  The point is out of ALL of the concealers Ive tried this Maybelline one is my favoriteI realize that my dedication to this concealer out of all the concealers in the world is kind of weird and random but I freaking love this product and Ive been using it for years now  Actually I take that back  I kind of hate this product  I would love to not be shackled to my drugaddictlike attachment to concealer  And no it doesnt work miracles my eye circles are still the bane of my facial existence  Yes I know my life is SO hard  But regardless this concealer is the best one Ive gotSometimes Ill get curious and try something else but I always come back to this  Its not too sheer but not too thick its not sticky and it doesnt crease especially not if I set it with a tiny bit of Make Up For Ever HD Microfinish Powder  This concealer comes in many different shades sometimes I go lighter or darker based on the time of year or mix a pinkbased hue with a yellowbased hue  It lasts a really long time its inexpensive especially if you buy it online and it doesnt irritate my usuallysensitive skinThe wand applicator is great  Ive found that most concealers that have a similar consistency to this one are packaged so that you have to click a button or knob on a penlike contraption in order to dispense more of the product and then oftentimes too much concealer blobs out at once and you end up wasting it which is especially annoying when you are dealing with a very expensive concealerSeveral of my friends have started using this concealer based on my rave reviews and this is probably also a good indication that my dark circles do in fact look far less horrifying once I have applied this product,0.113,0.088,0.799,0.9462,Positive

This is a pretty creamy moist concealer I like it quite a bit Its supposed to be a good dupe for Nars Radiant Creamy but thats out of my budget so I can only go by rumors It may be a bit creasy if you have a lot of undereye linesThe image attached shows a dot of Maybelline foundation Dream Urban Cover in the shade 115 Ivory It is surrounded by five dots of different Maybelline concealers five shades from four different linesSS is Super Stay in 10 Fair Its a little darkerashier than Fit Me and Instant Age Rewind in Fair Ill probably be testing 05 Ivory nextMC is Master Conceal in 10 Fair Its considerably lighterbrighter than Fit Me and Instant Age Rewind in Fair Ill probably be trying 20 Light nextBoth FMs are Fit Me FMF is Fit Me in 10 Fair and FML is Fit Me in 15 Light The former is a pretty good match for Instant Age Rewind in Fair and the latter is pretty close to the 115 Ivory foundation they were even closer afer drydown For other 115 foundation folks out there Fair is good for undereyes and Light is good for blemishesSide note the shade numbers on Fit Me Fair and Light were flipped at the initial release and possibly in some countries now they used to be 10 Light and 15 Fair Fair is lighter than Light so it now has a lower shade number as is the standard for Maybelline Keep that in mind when perusing swatches online Sometimes 10 and 15 are switched but Fair is always paler and cooler than LightIAR is Instant Age Rewind in 110 Fair It was still a little wet and heaped up at the time of the photo but dried down to be a pretty good match to the Fit Me FairHope this is helpful to any other paleskinned folks shopping for shades online,0.27,0.031,0.699,0.9981,Positive

This is my goto concealer because its very cheap and overall okay It gets the job done and covers up well The first time I bought it Im not sure why but it would always be burning my face and I still could never figure out why It would be stinging and hurting me a lot I ordered this again recently and it doesnt burn or sting my face anymore Maybe the first product I got was expired or just had the wrong chemicals Not sure why But buyers should be careful I think overall it blends nicely in and covers up my dark circles well but it can make my under eyes look grey which might be because of how dull certain areas of my face just are The concealer itself I wish it had more product but I rarely ever wear makeup so it lasted for like two years or so Its small and carryable The color goes well with my face and it makes me look younger and less tired It really brightens my look up,0.142,0.092,0.766,0.7848,Positive

This is a very nice match in the Fit me line It is very creamy and smooth I was very pleased with my purchase if this and will deff be buying this again in the future If you buy the same number as the foundation it matches perfectly And if you go a slight shade lighter it is beautiful for a enhancer for the eye areaI have been using the Maybelline brand for at least the past 89 years and I dont plan on switching Fingers crossed that they dont make and changes on their end But the Fit me matte it perfect if your face is a bit on the oily side And I have an issue with that by the end of the day And this foundation is excellent at controlling that If you use a really good moisturizer to set your face off and allow it to dry to tacky and then add a very good primer on top of that And let that set to bake a bit As you hunt for something to wear And then apply your foundation And then whatever eyeshadows mascaras liners brows etc  you are going to wear And then use a good primer to set all of it You will be good for the day Sure you could use whatever foundation and set it with a primer But it all plays hand in hand If one is bad then it knocks it all out of whack You have to use a good base and set it right And this foundation gives you a very good base,0.229,0.016,0.755,0.9963,Positive

The coverage for this concealer is AMAZING I was blown away at how well it covered my hereditary dark circles I love makeup but for a quick day to day I just stick with concealer to brighten up my under eye I usually buy more expensive brands for good coverage but Im allergic to the fragrance in them and I kept hearing great things about the FitMe concealer I really cant say enough about how impressed I was with it and its a fraction of the price And the best part is that my eyes dont get itchy at the end of the day because there is no fragrance The only reason Im giving it 4 stars is because of how hard it is to color match for me I am fairly pale but I have yellow undertones so I ordered 15 Light because the others look too pink but its a little too dark to wear as concealer Would be a great overall color but it wont brighten under my eyes as much and so it just doesnt work Luckily they offered me a refund I will go into a store and ask for a recommendation before I buy another color but definitely plan to buy FitMe concealer again if I can color match it well,0.213,0.045,0.742,0.992,Positive

This is absolutely perfect I really wasnt expecting it to be so great since its not that expensive and I tried the Fit Me foundation and hated itBut this concealer has really great coverage and feels so light It hasnt made me break out at all and doesnt settle into pores or fine lines though you can easily use a primer with it if you want for more assurance I use this for blemishes redness and dark circlesLet me tell you something about my dark circles for a second Theyre absolutely terrible and no amount of makeup has ever been able to make them go away or be reduced by much I fell deeply in love with this concealer because the lighter tones dont tend to have worsesheerer coverage which is a trend I notice with other concealers It stays opaque and all you have to do is lightly pat it around the horrible graypurpleohgodwhyme colored area with your ring fingers It doesnt look unnaturally heavy and it stays really well especially if set with some kind of powderThe only very tiny problem with it is that the tube makes the concealer look very slightly darker than it really is but its really not a huge deal or something you can avoid with any brand I would say its quite true to colorThe packaging is kind of neat I think Its very minimalist and chic and you can very easily travel with it since the lid is actually quite tight and the tube is pretty durable Dont let its thin design fool you theres quite a lot of product in this not to mention the great pigmentation means you dont have to use so much in the first placeIm so excited over this that I wish I could give it more than five stars Maybelline as many problems as weve had over the years you have made the only drugstore concealer that is any good for all purposes and is definitely worth the money I think Ill have to buy enough backups to last for the next few decades Talk about a hidden gem,0.161,0.069,0.77,0.9886,Positive

For years my HG concealer has been Laura Merciers Secret Concealer But I wanted something for days when I wear just very light makeup and turned to this after hearing lots of positive reviews on the Internet and also the Nars Creamy Concealer which many people say the Maybelline is a dupe forAfter having used this and the Nars a few times I have to say that the Nars provides better coverage and blends a little better However for the price the Maybelline concealer really is a star Its got a lovely texture not too thick not too liquidy and does blend well with either your fingers or a Beauty Blender though it doesnt disappear completely into the skin Still it looks pretty flawless and works very well on light makeup days I have very dark circles so this doesnt cover them up completely but then again no concealer does unless I use it with a color correctorI am about an NC2530 depending on how tan I am and I got this concealer in Light 10 When it arrived I was worried it would be too light But it looks wonderful once its blended in  you cant see any lines where the concealer starts and ends and my undereye area looks very natural just slightly brightened which is a great effect I am thinking of repurchasing it when I run outedited to add the followingAfter using this for quite a number of weeks I have to say that I think its even better than Nars Creamy Concealer The Nars has a tendency to settle into fine lines and look a little cakey after a few hours but the Maybelline stays pristine and undetectable Very impressed Am definitely going to repurchase,0.226,0.027,0.747,0.9969,Positive
Bought maybelline fit me in shade 10 first and then 15 I have a light maybe even fair skin with redcool undertones and for me 10 is a bit too light but 15 is perfect It is spread easily with fingers or concealer brush and holds on perfectly for full 8 hours at least I do not have darkness or puffiness under eyes just a little dark on the inner corner of the eye and this product does a very good job on me I use it also to conceal my pimples on the chin and overall I am very happy with this product especially after paying twice for tarte concealer highly claimed and praised one which cannot be even compared to this product so after wasting money on tarte concealer decided to write the review for maybelline maybe someone will not repeat my mistake,0.221,0.024,0.755,0.9867,Positive

I typically use high end concealers due to my lifelong struggle with severe hereditary circles For me money is basically no object when it comes to concealer   I just want something that will make me look like I dont have two black eyes I tried this stuff a couple years back and liked it but continued to experiment Several hundred dollars later and Im back to Fit Me as my daily concealer Is it the most opaque coverage No But now that Im 32 I need something that isnt drying or cakey and Im willing to sacrifice a bit of coverage for a more youthful natural look  I played around with super emollient concealers like Tarte Maracuja and It Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereye and Im not saying Im going to toss them out but for every day this stuff wins due to its easy application and blending The doe foot applicator is a boon on rushed mornings The formula feels very similar to Nars Radiant however I find this gives a more natural finish The Nars tends to dry up and crack on me I do use a color corrector first due to the severity of my circles Armani the orange one and I set with Laura Mercier Brightening powder and a spritz of Mac Fix  This combo is working beautifully I say give it a shot Its cheap as hell and if you think it sucks just throw it in your purse as a backup,0.192,0.065,0.743,0.9894,Positive

Every few years I find a makeup product that works perfectly and is affordable  Then the inevitably discontinue it  I just found this after looking for a few years for a new concealer with more coverage  I am 32 fair with freckles in summer dark circles all year long and newly developing fine lines around my eyes  I used to use covergirl concealer with a blue wand top  That still is the only other concealer that doesnt settle and make my lines look worse but the coverage isnt strong enough now with darker circles  This product is just as creamy and blendable but gives more coverage  I have been using it for two weeks and I love it  I wear contacts and this doesnt bother them or make my eyes watery  Light 10 is a perfect match for me  I think I am in the middle between a cool and warm complexion and this color blends easily with my fingers and disappears but makes my circles disappear as well  My lines look about the same or slightly less than without concealer  They certainly are not accentuated by this as they were with the dozens of others I have tried and threw away  I would pay double or triple for this but am so happy it is affordable  The price here seems to be comparable to other places  I am buying extras now in case it ever gets discontinued  By the way on the rare occasion I get a blemish this covers that well too  I am so pleased with this and recommend it to anyone with thin skin fines lines and dry skin who normally experiences the caking or settling of concealer around the eyes,0.16,0.049,0.791,0.9881,Positive

I ordered 40 caramel because the shades 45 and 30 both oxidize to a deeper red undertone My skin is more on the golden side If you are looking for a golden undertone concealer try fawn from the la girl pro concealer All of these seem to oxidize and turn red However I have no complains for the formula,0.0,0.083,0.917,-0.5859,Negative
So I originally purchased this for an under eye concealer to replace the one I had just bought that ended up being the wrong color  This one was definitely better  You can use this as your primary concealer or your under eye  I am not highly impressed but I am also not disappointed  It works for its intended use so I am happy  I wish they gave more product in the tube  I apply it with the included applicator wand and then blend it out with a brush or beauty sponge  It does tend to make the skin feel a little oily  Removal is super easy as well  Overall it is a good product  I actually purchased this in another shade right after using it once so I could use it as my primary concealer and my under eye  One con the company needs to offer this is a bigger variety of shades,0.221,0.023,0.756,0.9887,Positive

I have really dark circles I was born with them and they just keep getting worse as I age I must have tried a thousand concealers over the years Probably many more than that but I dare not think about all the money I spent I ordered Fit Me in Light after seeing a YouTube video and how well it covered the womans dark circles who was demonstrating it I got light although my skin is medium I always go one shade lighter with concealer because it has a big job to do covering brown circles like mine This concealer comes in a convenient tube with a sponge applicator It is creamy and the color is about what I expectedIt isnt thick but not runny either I usually use a peachy colored primer then apply concealer I did this and my eye area looked great BUTwithin an hour my dark circles were back Not completely but they were in need of brightening If only the concealer stayed put for even a few hours I would be happy I do lightly powder the area but need to be careful or else my aging I am almost 50 eyes will looked creased and worse than beforeI like this concealer but it just doesnt have the staying power I need Not many do so it isnt just THIS one that wears off I have a couple that I like but even the high end ones wear off in a few hours Hassle This concealer would be fine for anyone  who wants to conceal mild circles marks and blemishes but if you need something to camouflage dark circles or other tough spots and you need it to last I dont think you will be completely satisfied with this one I touch up throughout the day with an eye brightener but for once I would like to go out and feel confident that the way I looked when I left is the way I will look two or three hours later I am going 3 stars The search continues and probably will continue forever,0.139,0.022,0.838,0.992,Positive

I was hoping that this would be a drugstore replacement for the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer  Its not  But it is very cheap compared the NARS product runs 29 for the same size container  The color of this compared to the NARS is a little beigetanner and the the NARS is a bit more grey  The Maybelline is thinner and less richly pigmented which is really the only issue that I have with it  I have very dark purpley circles around my eyes have since I was a wee lassy and concealer has been my only fix  I dab it around the inside and under my eyes and use a concealer brush to smooth out and blend up onto my upper lid theyre also very purpley  Since the coverage isnt quite as good as the NARS I go back over with a tiny bit of the NARS to hide things even better  If my circles werent so dark I would definitely only use the Maybelline  The Maybelline actually creases far less than the NARS does so its a better base anyway  It has reduced the amount of NARS thatI have to use and I am very happy with this product,0.127,0.026,0.847,0.9673,Positive

I would rate this 45 if possible since it was perfect for what I ended up using it for but it was not quite right for what I intended it for that being covering my dark undereye circles I read this was a very popular concealer amongst beauty artists so thought I would give it a tryIt was not a good color for me to conceal my dark undereye circles but it largely stays on during the day albeit it seemed a bit dry looking as the day wore on Maybe I needed a peachyer shade  It seems not be able to counteract the dark bluish tone to undereye circles despite being highly pigmentedIt WAS perfect for covering a bruise on my leg it blended perfectly and did not come off all day At the end of the day it stayed on even after a shower and I had to remove the concealer with rubbing alcohol  I am not sure if this could fully cover a tattoo but it probably could cover some tattoos  The bruise was pretty dark and this concealer still looked natural on my skin,0.151,0.028,0.821,0.9809,Positive

No matter what I do this concealer immediately settles into the creases around my eyes so its a bust for under eye concealer However the formula is so smooth and silky and the coverage is lovely  not at all sheer and yet not too heavy like a lot of full coverage concealers Because of that this has still become a staple in my makeup bag I use it on my cheeks to cover up discoloration from sun damage and anywhere else I need extra coverage instead of adding extra layers of foundation It blends beautifully with my foundation or my bb cream The shades are darker than expected I ordered light and it matches my skin tone with a medium summer tan,0.069,0.061,0.87,0.2709,Positive

Dries down fast unlike the shape tape which is what I normally use I like that it doesnt feel heavy or too full coverage I have to do one area at a time with this one instead of applying to all the areas and then blending Also it does oxidize at least on me Im very fair and red headed so it turns a little orange,0.079,0.0,0.921,0.624,Positive

This was the first liquid concealer I have purchased previously didnt use any or got a lipsticklooking cream sort of one as a gift and didnt like it After reading reviews and figuring out which on would be good quality but cheaper  since I hadnt used it and didnt know if Id like it  I came across this oneAfter having it for a few months now  I love it I would definitely buy this again I use it to cover imperfections or to hide dark circles under my eyes as a touchup after work etcI was a tad nervous to pick a color online but the one I ordered worked perfectly Im quite pale and have a slight red undertone and ordered 25 mediumI have had no discomfort or irritation occur which is not something I normally have to worry about  I dont have particularly sensitive skin I am on the oily side but wearing this had has no illeffectsI do notice that after a long day sometimes bigger imperfections will end up showing though but I chalk this up to normal makeup fading that happens as you wear it longer and am experimenting with makeup setting sprays and primers  This is easy enough to keep in my purse and dab on touchups if I am going somewhere further after work so I have no real complaints,0.094,0.134,0.772,-0.7888,Negative

When this product came in it had obviously already been opened Amazon was quick to send me a replacement though For the price this is a pretty good concealer I will say that light is a little dark so if you have fair to light skin I recommend getting the lightest shade that they have available I had this concealer on over my foundation for over 8 hours yesterday and even took a nap in it and it held up pretty well I had a little mascara smudges under my eye but im not sure if that is from the concealer or the new setting powder I used I give it 4 stars because the color isnt exactly light,0.11,0.022,0.868,0.719,Positive
Its just ok I never used concealer in my life till I hit my late 40s and noticed some duskiness and uneven color under my eyes and around my nose  Granted this one is very low priced and low tech  so I didnt expect much and Im not accustomed to applying it  so dont put a lot of stock in my assessment  but i feel like the more I try to blend it with my beauty blender the more uneven it looks  so you have to work very quickly and maybe even use some moisturizer over your primer to make it more workable,0.109,0.032,0.859,0.8465,Positive

I bought this because the price was unbeatable and I wanted to try it out as a possible wedding product I know next to nothing about makeup but Im in love with this product Its a lightweight formula and doesnt make my skin look cakey and matched my skin tone perfectly while really brightening my under eye I have super dry skin and this product laid on really well and almost felt like it added more moisture to my skin The coverage i would say is medium as it covered most of my dark spots and blemishes but then again I only put on the tiniest amount Overall Im very impressed with this product,0.248,0.0,0.752,0.9888,Positive

Im brunette fair skin dark circles under eyes I keep searching for a concealer that could help with that but this wasnt it Have bought various shades and it doesnt seem to conceal anything very well or for very long But it might not be the product it could just be my skinNote I am 54 and the undereye area is also showing slight wrinkles so the concealer does tend to get a little cakey in the creases Maybe not the best product to be using for my skin type so as my search continues I cant blame the product if it is all me3 stars for not concealing other areas it should as stated in its description,0.075,0.037,0.887,0.3801,Positive
Overall I am quite pleased with the product It is a little lighter than I had expected but seems to work well The application is simple and it hides the freckles I want it to hide A simple applicator brush to get the concealer exactly where you want it  I dont use the product daily but have used it frequently and know that it does not cause any skin irritation  The price point is good  Its a nice product to have in your cosmetic bag even if you have flawless skin  Every now and then there seems to be something we want to hide even if it is just for a special occasion Isnt it funny how one tiny thing on your face makes you worry so much This helps give your security and confidence back,0.22,0.107,0.673,0.9547,Positive
This is a decent concealer  I have tried lots of different ones my current favorite is Ultas full coverage concealer but this one is pretty good  The color was a nice light shade for when Im not tan during the winter  It did a decent job of covering under eye circles but perhaps was a bit underwhelming on a pesky healing blemish I had to apply a little more and then ultimately applied some of my fullcoverage Ulta on top  All in all for the price this is not badI should mention that the first time I received the product it did not come in any kind of cardboardplastic packaging and moreover there was a piece of tape around the seam between the top applicator and rest of the tube which was a bit disconcerting  I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent me a replacement which had an actual companylabeled seam between the two parts of the container,0.127,0.017,0.856,0.9477,Positive
I recently purchased this concealer after seeing a demonstration on a YouTube video It looked like it went on very smoothly and covered the dark circles on the model so I went ahead and ordered some for myself I purchased the Sand color as I was hoping for a good match to my fairmed skin tone It it a bit more yellow than I thought it would be and I was skeptical before applying it but it actually did a good job of covering up the dark circles under my eyes It didnt crease fade or cake on me for the 10 hours I had it on my face and it stayed well despite the heat and humidity The Fit Me concealer did do the job for much less than the department store brands of concealer I have bought in the past I like the applicator the sponge tip made it easy to put the concealer where I needed it It blended easily with my fingertips and it stayed put so I have to say I am pleased with my purchase,0.166,0.009,0.825,0.9797,Positive

First off I should say this concealer is amazing It is thick enough to cover blemishes without being patchy or clinging weirdly and it lasts all dayIt doesnt look heavy or oxidize and it covers my spots enough that I can wear it without foundationUnfortunately the shade the shade range is confusing and unimpressive I am on the fairer side and the shade 15 fair only matches the areas of my faces with more pigmentation like my cheeks and nose I would never be able to use this under my eyes because its too dark It doesnt seem like the shades go very dark either for people with deeper skin tones Thats particularly disappointing because the Fit Me foundation goes much lighter and darker than the concealer shades Seriously Maybelline how do 9 shades 6 originally fit everyoneAs a side note for some reason the shade 15 is lighter than 10 Im not really sure why they ordered them that way,0.097,0.08,0.823,0.5838,Positive

My favorite concealer I used to not use any kind of liquid makeup until i tried this product on a whim for my under eye area Now i use it all over I use a damp beauty blender and use the fair color under my eyes and everywhere under where I highlight I also blend in light sometimes around my forehead and cheeks because i usually look so pale and it blends really well into my skin without looking too dark I will also use fair under my brows to make them look more definedThe best thing about this product is that it doesnt feel heavy on my skin I have very greasy skin and as long as I go back and set my makeup with powder it stays on without making my face look like a complete greasy mess by the end of the dayThe coverage is just okay Under my eyes it does great but for covering redness around my cheeks and nose not so much That goes for concealing blemishes too Its probably not the best liquid makeup in the world but Im not complaining And im definitely not complaining about the price Its a small tube but it lasts me awhile,0.157,0.008,0.835,0.9785,Positive

This is perfect for my undereye area and it conceals other spots pretty well I do bake to help it set but I typically dont need to reapply during the day Keep in mind that Im not exactly active so I cant speak to staying power when someone sweats a bit more but it does work for someone like me who is more sedentary at a desk job Its light enough that it does help conceal and brighten around the eyes Im not a pale princess but I also cant use it as contour besides the area under my eyes so it still works pretty well for someone like meIt hasnt irritated my eyes as far as I know either and they tend to be fairly sensitive to irritants I havent had breakouts either in the areas I use it to spotconceal so it appears to be fairly good for my combination dryoily skin Its a weird place to be skinwise but I work with it I havent noticed oxidation which was a problem I had with another brandAs far as drugstore brand concealers go this one is perfect for me,0.192,0.059,0.748,0.9802,Positive
My office coordinator told me about the Fit makeup line So I decided to try it Let me tell youit is AMAZING The concealer fits my skin tone to a T Plus the price was super inexpensive I had previously spent 80 on a product that wasnt even close to matching my skin tone even though I took a match your skin tone test But the Fit concealer is definitely a keeper The transaction was smooth and the shipment arrived super quick Thanks bunches This will be a repeat purchase for this concealer,0.23,0.0,0.77,0.9718,Positive

My dermatologist recommends this fitme line of makeup because it is noncomedogenic I used it as foundation without using any powder and the look is more natural with very good coverage The only problem is it is small tube and does not last long I just started using it and not sure how long the small tube will last me It can end up being expensive because I use it as foundation instead of concealer As a concealer I think it is perfect and good value,0.181,0.049,0.77,0.9103,Positive

This is a good product to enhanceUnexpected I was using it to cover up a part of my face and it really does a good job at highlighting So if you apply it in just the right amount easy to over apply with the tool given  which is disastrous it can be an attribute as wellThe amount was good too for the price No issuesThe color I was scared by so many reviews so I went with a bit lighter than I really consider myself I think it could swing either way If you over apply you will look ridiculous no matter what the color is so that is the key thing to be subtleDid well in covering up what I was trying to cover up for a few weeks and I only had to apply once a dayNote I do not have PRIME since Amazoncom does NOT stand behind their BS markup service and have become WORSE since they started pushing it so much at delivering non PRIME items,0.084,0.099,0.817,-0.5766,Negative

I bought this after hearing the rave reviews from one of my favorite makeup YouTubers Marlena from Makeup Geek and couldnt wait to get my hands on it and was ecstatic to find that it was cheaper here than at the drugstore  I havent been able to find a concealer that has staying power on my pale oily skin while simultaneously hiding the dreaded eye bags and occasional face demons  The color is perfect I am very pale and it is hard to find a good color the texture is wonderful it glides on like a dream and blends effortlessly  The only issue I have with it is that it doesnt like to stay put very well even if I apply primer and bake with powder  I usually have to touch it up at least once during the day  However with the coverage color application and texture I really dont mind  I very much recommend this product,0.169,0.054,0.777,0.9621,Positive
It did its job as a good concealer that hides my sins but for the few hours I did put it on I immediately had some acne flare up I noticed once I took it off Its covers up but for more sensitive skin it may clog pores I got Sand and for my cool tone skin it was a little orange but hid my lack of sleep well I want to like it especially with this price point but my skin says no,0.138,0.116,0.745,0.4489,Positive

Very good concealer i got a color that is slightly darker than I expected but thats not a big deal it blends nicely and holds up pretty well not too light and not too cakey its just right does not seem to oxidize very good price But i will say that there isnt much product in my opinion it lasted a lot less than other concealers Ive had in the past It is a pretty good concealer nothing mind blowing though but you really cannot complain much because of the price i will say for its price its pretty good But I dont think Ill buy it again Id rather have a concealer that is just as good if not better for a few extra bucks and that would last a lot more than this one,0.282,0.02,0.699,0.9921,Positive
Men dont use concealer right Wrong Smart ones do very scarcely here and there I always keep it around with Skin that is unpredictable under stress This comes in an insane amount of shades holds up well enough and is a great bang for buck Skip the fancy mens concealers Youll pay double for an inferior product in a more elegant  manly packageThis works well for me only in rare situationsNo one has ever been able to tell Thats the key Highly recommended,0.168,0.129,0.703,0.584,Positive

I like the applicator tip Ive heard that this is supposed to be a dupe to NARS Radiant Concealer  I didnt want to pay 30 for that so I decided to try this Picking a color was difficult online but I went with Hazelnut For reference Im a medium brown skinned AfricanAmerican woman like the color of mahogany wood It goes on looking light but blends out to a darker shade The coverage is medium Not full and not sheer It is however buildable I cant speak to whether it creases or not as I have not worn it for a full day yet Id definitely recommend a setting powder if creasing is a concern for you Id say this concealer is worth a try,0.158,0.037,0.805,0.9333,Positive

This is easily the BEST concealer I have ever used  Once upon a time when Maybelline still made their Mineral Power concealer in my color Ivory I thought I had found the best concealer  But when I switched to this one I realized that THIS was the best affordable concealer out there  I use the shade 15 Fair which actually matches my skin better than the Ivory did  Most mornings I dab a tiny bit on each of my blemishes and lightly blend it in  My nose gets pink whenever I get too hot or too cold so I always blend a little of this concealer on it in the morning to maintain even coloring in my face  The fantastic thing about this concealer is that it looks about as good by the time I go to bed as it looked when I first put it on fresh  Because some areas on my face are oily and other areas are dry I always apply Olay face lotion first before applying this Fit Me concealer so it goes on smooth and even,0.185,0.0,0.815,0.9886,Positive
Always on the hunt for my holy grails but this has been it for the concealer category for years Its difficult to find your shade as a fair skin girl like others have said They stopped selling Ivory in stores I think because I can only find on Amazon But Ivory is better than fair for pale with yellow undertones And as others have stated the Light shade is very deceiving name and is kinda tan and makes the red worse in my skinBut this stuff is the best and literally all I need Proof expensive isnt always better,0.202,0.109,0.689,0.9083,Positive
Update Oct2020I still feel the same way about this concealer you absolutely cannot go wrong I still use and love itThis is probably my favorite concealer at the moment which is saying a lot considering I have so many both drug store and high end concealers This is perfect for the summer time when you want decent coverage but nothing too thick and that sweats off It blends perfectly with a beauty blender and conceals all redness and my favorite is that it is very lightweight and not cakey whatsoeverMany people would compare this to the NARS creamy concealer  and they are simular in packaging however this one is much less creamy and in my opinion easier to blend and more build able I feel like the NARS one sinks into any fine lines and creases way more than this one I never had a problem with creasing with the maybelline fit me concealer Overall I would definitely buy it again its just perfect and the price cant be beat Buy it you wont regret it,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.9942,Positive

I bought this to try and Wow what a shocking disappointment I am Fair skinned and wanted a hint of color more than the Ivory under my eyes this seemed like the best choice before getting into a beigeAs soon as Started to apply lightly it looked yellowish in my 10x mirror I finished my normal light dab and when i looked into the regular mirror I was correctIt has an extreme Yellow base instead of being the color they show as Sand  There was no second thoughts  I had to wash it off and apply the IvoryAbsolutely a waist of money when the product does not even resemble the perfect color you see in the containerI guess there really is a First for everythingIf you do not want a Yellow base then do not purchase this productI will be staying with the Porcelain or Ivory which matches my complexion,0.107,0.061,0.833,0.8433,Positive

I have used this since it first came out  I think it is one of the best drugstore concealers It is easy to blend has the right amount of creamytackiness which makes it easier to blend The only downfall is that it may be difficult to find a perfect match since there are so many different types of skin tones It also does not stay on as long as I like even with setting with a powder It doesnt cake up unless my skin is really dryI have been using this in my quick morning routine I first apply a moisturizer let it soak in  then apply a powder foundation Then I use this concealer and Maybellines undereye concealer and let it sit a few minutes before I blend it out It is quick easy and gives a flawless look,0.154,0.017,0.829,0.9628,Positive

So far my favorite drug store concealer I typically shop high end products but things just tend to fall into my cart whenever Im out and about lol I tried the fit me foundation and its become a holy grail for me so I figured Id give this a shot Its not full coverage it has a natural looking finish and its lightweight For those reasons I enjoy using it on light makeup days under the eyes Their shade range isnt that great and this brand also does animal testing which are huge cons in ny book but overall I do enjoy the product I bought it mostly for testing and review purposes otherwise I stay far away from anything that isnt vegan or cruelty free,0.228,0.031,0.741,0.982,Positive

I bought Medium 025 Cafe 030 and Deep 035 I assumed based on the number system and names that Medium would be the lightest of the three with Deep would be the darkest In actuality Cafe is the darkest and the match for my skintone As far as contouring  the purpose of these purchases two lighter shades and one matching shade is not quite the ideal one lighter one matching and one darker like I needed The reason this particular color received four stars and not five like the other two colors did is because I fully expected 025 to be the lightest and 030 to be my match I did NOT expect 035 to be in between 025  030 its actually kind of blowing my mindI thought I had thought this through well enough before my purchase,0.059,0.066,0.875,-0.4556,Negative

I have this concealer in two shades 10 Light and 25 Medium I use a combination of both for my under eyes and just the 10 Light for spot concealer Two things to note 1 This is a mediumcoverage concealer so it wont necessarily cover everything in one go and 2 Its buildable which is great because I can use a dab to cover a dark spot or healing zit and then build up layers in another place that needs a little extra coverage Its not the type to replace foundation like some of the other concealers do but it does the job And it doesnt break me out even with consistent daily usage Win for me,0.084,0.0,0.916,0.8591,Positive

I just bought this for a second time As far as cheap or drugstore options this is one of the best concealers out there Obviously Tartes Shape Tape is the market leader and for good reason its an incredible product but sometimes I just dont want to spend that much on makeup Sometimes i just want to have a cheap option that costs 5 that Im not going to be tempted to ration out or only use on special occasions If youre like me try this concealer,0.128,0.03,0.843,0.8652,Positive

This concealer works great It has the perfect size doe foot applicator Most concealers work on my under eyes but very few look good and completely cover healing zits but this one does It is just moist enough to not cake but not too liquidly that you need to chase it around your face and hassle with setting powders My skin is on the drier side and sensitive but this does not cling to my dry patches or break me outThe reason I took one star away is because of the colors light is too yellow and medium is a little pink therefore it looks a little off on my lightmedium neutral skintone But overall great concealer one of my favorites No smell no gross separation not drying not runny and didnt break me out,0.121,0.064,0.814,0.8672,Positive

I really like this product It doesnt make me break out and even though Im in my 20s I have very sensitive skin Its a bit lighter than expected but I still used it for highlighting and covering those pesky spots when they show I recommend this product to anyone because it is lightweight and I used it during my internship while working at Disney World in the summer in that hot and humid weather and it still seemed to mostly last 4 stars and not 5 because it is definitely worth the price and I can tell it is on the lower end of the spectrum when it comes to makeup but the price is right and Im about to buy it again,0.088,0.045,0.868,0.6648,Positive

My skin is a bit sensitive and Im really starting to get those fine lines all around my eyes where the skin ages a little faster plus Im closing in on 40 The color worked great for my skin tone and using a beauty blender with this helped keep the coverage even but light all around my eyes making it look a good bit softer and helped mask the lack of sleep the night before  I usually get a breakout feeling from foundation and concealers so Ive never really used them but I had no issue with this My skin has always been normal but is leaning toward dry as I get older This didnt feel oily or create that ugly shine and the wand helps place the product in a nice even way I think its a fantastic product if youre cost conscious or costprohibited from getting different brands well worth the money,0.185,0.06,0.755,0.9607,Positive

I love love love this concealer I used a bottle of NARS vanilla and needed a new concealer but did not want to spend 30 on one bottle After spending much time watching reviews I finally ordered this concealer It is fantastic for the price It is a little less creamy than the NARS creamy concealer go figure but it works very well and lasts a long time I was my face occasionally throughout the day so sometimes I have to reapply but it is never completely gone When I was at Sephora I was told by a worker to buy a shade lighter than your skin color to help brighten your eyes I ordered both the light and fair but the fair was a bit too pale for me Even now during the summer the light seems to be getting a bit light as expected since I am more tan but I may order a shade darker to use during the summer,0.177,0.008,0.815,0.9813,Positive

I ordered this because I recently went to the beach and needed a tanner concealer It was a little darker than I expected but what can you do when ordering makeup off the internet I own about 5 of these concealers in different shades and the main complaint I have is that while they are dewey they really bring out the oil in my skin Like I love how they look with no powder but since I have combination skin throughout the day their on my tzone really comes out with powder I couldnt image how bad it would be without With that said really good and affordable concealer Will be buying again,0.144,0.047,0.809,0.9262,Positive
I use this product as a highlight for my contour This product was recommended to me by one of my favorite beauty bloggers so I thought I would give it a shot I really do enjoy the way that it accentuates my contour The reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because if I was thinking of this as a concealer it really did not do much when it comes to covering up the dark circles under my eyes or my blemishes which is ultimately what you want a concealer to be able to do however for the price it acts as a really great highlight so I would recommend it for that purpose,0.211,0.017,0.773,0.9695,Positive

I purchased this item after searching for cut crease concealer and reading the amazing reviews It has minimal to moderate coverage Definitely not full coverage and virtually useless to those that like a smokey eye with cut crease Might be nice for those wanting a sheer to minimal maybe moderate coverage concealer,0.194,0.115,0.691,0.7003,Positive
This concealer is perfect for my mochacocoa skin tone its not too thick so i apply just a tad under my eyes top lip and bridge of my nose i usually let it sit for 23 minutes before i blot away with the beauty blender then i add a setting poder over it but in all honesty it does not make my face look ashy or dry i have not broken out and its also been easy to wash and wipe away by the end of the day its given me an all day stay ill be using this concealer from now on because the others ive tried have been to thick and made me look like a ghost,0.161,0.051,0.787,0.9221,Positive

I use it every day for a year and a half and I couldnt be happier Before I discovered this I was using an expensive concealer from Sephora which was drying my skin under the eyes and it made my wrinkles even more obvious But FitMe is very soft blends good and covers all the spots and blemishes which I have on my skin I also ordered their foundation which is perfect Not to mention that it stays on the entire day I work in a restaurant its a physical work I sweat a lot and I touch my face A LOT It even stays ON even if I use napkins on my skin like blowing my nose,0.112,0.017,0.872,0.9128,Positive
love how natural it looks on my skin I bought 15 light and 20 Sand and its a pretty good match I used it all over the face instead of foundation and it does the job The only problem is how fast it creases under my eyes as soon as I blend it out I have to set it to prevent serious creasing Its a good medium coverage concealer and if you build it up it doesnt look cakey and I mean for the price its worth it,0.197,0.042,0.76,0.9287,Positive

I have used this product many times before and have sometimes switched to other sometimes more expensive concealers but keep coming back to this one  Its very reasonably priced and a little goes a long way so it lasts  I prefer the color Fair as opposed to the color Light but Fair always seems to be sold out at my local stores  Fair is better for cool toned skin like mine Light is too yellow for me and looks much better on warm or more olive skin tones  A little dab gently patted in with a clean fingertip does the trick either under foundation or over Not waxy chalky nor greasy It stays put Really like this product,0.259,0.01,0.731,0.9874,Positive

As we all know covering shadows under your eyes is very tough I once knew a woman who successfully covered her shadows but she used six thin coats of concealer and it took her two hoursThis stuff is good but I think youd have to make a serious effort to cover your shadows For most of us two hours is too much At least I wear glasses and can cover the shadows that way,0.081,0.039,0.881,0.6253,Positive
This is good concealer but did get creasy after two applications I bought foundation concealer and powder in this Fit Me line and Im very happy with them This concealer has a very nice cool tone  I have trouble finding concealer that doesnt turn my undereye yellow  and blends beautifully It doesnt cover perfectly and when I applied a second layer with powder it creased pretty badly However it was very light and comfortable to wear and looked very natural I might try a higher end concealer at some point but Im pretty happy with this one for now,0.34,0.09,0.571,0.9892,Positive
I had given up trying to find the perfect makeup for my finicky fair skin when I purchased this concealer My expensive lessthanstellar BB cream had run out so I figured for 5 how could I go wrong Even now I cant believe how RIGHT this product is for me especially for the price This covers every blemish perfectly yet still somehow allows some natural pigmentation to show through After applying the concealer I finish with Maybellines Fit Me Matte Poreless Powder shade Porcelain Next time I will try Translucent for an even better match seriously my skin is Vampiric The combo creates a naturally flawless look blush optionalNote I received no incentive to purchase this product or write this review Just a VERY happy customer,0.22,0.05,0.73,0.9742,Positive

I was using a very expensive department store product to cover up the eczema patches on my face about 3 years ago Im extremely self conscious about it and was convinced I needed an expensive product I saw this on a newsfeed about great value products and bought it for my travel kit It goes on smooth and creamy and doesnt irritate my eczema I actually prefer it over my expensive concealer that was almost 10 times the price,0.145,0.0,0.855,0.8893,Positive
Ive heard many great things about this product and was anxious to try it out I have slight dark circles under my eyes and this concealer does a marvelous job at concealing them and also brightening my undereye area This concealer is a not too thick and and not too thin so applying it with a damp beauty blender is my favorite way to apply this product I only have to apply once and it does exactly what its supposed to do Id say that its quickly becoming one of my favorite and must have concealers due to its high coverage on par with some of my higher end concealing products This a great product to try and I highly recommend this Ill definitely be buying one again when my tube runs out,0.204,0.037,0.759,0.9784,Positive

I dont like a lot retail store make up but this has been my go to concealer for 5 years now I have oily skin so I like that its  lightweight but gives me amazing coverage without settling into my pores or creases Easily blends and is buildable Best advice because of its light weight feature is to let it bake with face powder before applying your foundation for maximum hold and that matte finish I also like wearing it alone around the shadowy areas of my face and notice I dont need foundation afterwards Which is perfect for my days off or when I want to give my face a foundation break,0.165,0.075,0.76,0.935,Positive

I guess I didnt feel it was fair to leave a one or two star since the concealer SEEMS good However if this is the lightest shade they have in existence right now I do wish to request they keep us really pale people in mind during their next meeting Because this is WAY too dark Im what I like to call Casper shade with a hint of corpseI cant wear this And its so much lighter looking in the screen than it is in person This photo was taken in my bathroom but with natural light from the windowId make an oompa loompa jealous with the shade of orange id end up with if I wore this on my face,0.085,0.042,0.873,0.5187,Positive

I wish I would have taken a picture I saw the concealers were on sale so I purchased 2 a dark and light shade I use the dark concealer to contour and what I first noticed was the safety seal on my concealer had been really carefully sliced to look like it was still connected but was not I still ended up trying it just to see if it was a fake and it went downhill from there the concealer was SO dry and difficult to spread piled into one spot when I tried to blend it and just looked terrible I didnt even try the other concealer I ordered,0.063,0.119,0.818,-0.8761,Negative
I love this concealer I have used it just about every day for the past 23 years Its a great product I will continue to buy it over and over again I use it on imperfections blemishes and my terribly dark under eyes It is very creamy and doesnt dry too fast so its easy to blend I do notice it can crease a little under my eyes if I dont set it with a powder but it is better than almost all of the drug store concealers when it comes to creasing and with a little powder it will last all day I would and have recommend this to friends or anyone who wants a high quality concealer that comes at a great price,0.185,0.018,0.797,0.9714,Positive

This is one of the only beauty products I have used up completely and repurchased three times Being a beauty product junkie this should speak to how great this concealer is I love that its creamy enough to use under the eyes and not cause drynesscreasing yet not SO creamy that you can use it on other areas of the face and it wont move around I feel like this is comparable to the Nars creamy concealer for just a fraction of the price The color is perfectly warm yet fair so that you can also highlight your face without it turning ashy I will continue to use this concealer for years to come,0.228,0.0,0.772,0.9821,Positive

Im not clear on what this would be used for Its too thick and gooey to blend nicely I tried it under my eyes and it would not blend without glopping in to undereye lines I tried it just on red spots under foundation and it was too noticeable Im very fair skinned brunette and with combination skin This didnt  make me break out which was a plus but it also didnt work as well as the regular cover stick method If you had just a few spots you could probably blend this out like a foundation to hide them with some powder to fix It seems geared to a very young woman without lines or dry patches,0.059,0.049,0.892,0.2809,Positive
So I really love the color and the product The only downfall is that it doesnt last all last long which I think is part of longevity because there just isnt enough product is what I mean I guess I expected that why I gave it the 1 less star but I get bummed having to rebuy it so maybe I will look for a full coverage product of theirs that comes in a larger size like for foundation But I love the coverage and the wear I will buy again though for sure,0.17,0.0,0.83,0.9497,Positive

I was excited to receive this product because of the rave it got on makeup review sites I got 15 fair and it is a little bit too pink undertone for me To cover red zits I dont want a pink toned concealer  it just makes it more pink and not necessarily similar to my skin color If it were more yellow it would be easier to blend and hide blemishes and dark circles However it does cover up these things very well I do not have to reapply it throughout the day or 2 minutes after I put foundation on top of it I am pleased with the coverage I may repurchase this product,0.127,0.026,0.847,0.8927,Positive

I had high hopes for this concealer  I will not be buying it again once it runs out  It did not cover some dark spots on my cheeks as I would have wanted to  I also noticed that it settled into some linesI have already found a replacement Maybelline Instant Rewind Age MultiUse Concealer Medium to Full Coverage,0.051,0.0,0.949,0.4215,Positive

Ive heard how great this line is for years but have never gotten around to try it out I was previously using a concealer from another brand that I loved but it was discontinued so I thought Id try it out I know that in the past Maybelline was known for its eye makeup but most of the face products they released were gimmicky and didnt stick around This is definitely a quality usable makeup It blends really well and doesnt settle in to my wrinkles Im not that old and dont have deep wrinkles but some drug store concealers really target those fine lines This product is a winner if youre looking for an affordable concealer,0.177,0.0,0.823,0.973,Positive

This concealer is amazing It does everything a concealer should do and for the price you cant beat it Its so light weight it barely looks like youre wearing anything and yet it covers so well I have a lot of redness around my nose and on my eyes and it covered all of that right up for me I also got a small scratch on my chin from my dog and it covered that right up too I cant say how good it is for acne because I dont have that problem but I image it would do very well I would have provided pictures to support this but my camera is very poor,0.123,0.053,0.824,0.7491,Positive
I love the Fit Me foundation so I decided to try the concealer as well Im not AS crazy about this part of the line The color is much lighter than pictured I bought 15 Fair and its very VERY light  almost ivory with very little of the brown tones in the photo Its very thick and opaque so it offers a lot of coverage But be careful how much you apply If you slap this on like other thinner concealers youll be blending for a long time,0.177,0.0,0.823,0.9025,Positive

Ive waited a few weeks to write this review so I could really try this product out  I bought the lightest color available and it still seems slightly dark for my skintone  I am not overly pale either The concealer almost has an orange tint to it which I am not fond of  The coverage is decent but I definitely prefer my MAC concealer over this  I am a bit disappointed because I read so many great reviews about this and I found it to be just average  Dont get me wrong it is a pretty good drugstore concealer but I dont really think it adds up to all of the hype surrounding it  The coverage was decent and the consistency was nice  not too thick and not too thin  Overall it was okay but I probably will not repurchase after I use this up,0.175,0.038,0.787,0.9729,Positive

I tried this product on for the first time this morning and boy did it wake me up  Not in a good way  After washing my face applying face serum moisturizer and then primer I applied this product in an upside down triangle under my eyes  It burned like Satans balls  Oh my lord I jumped up and down and ran around the bathroom  I think I was unconsciously running from the pain  After a while the burning subsided  Oh and the color is just too damn light but I have to say it is highly pigmented  Im pretty sure the area below the concealer application is a valley of red anger but you cant see it because the concealer does its job so well,0.099,0.082,0.82,0.5031,Positive

Really excellent drugstore brand Blends very well and provides full coverage comparable but not identical to NARS creamy concealer Apply to one eye at a time and blend with a beauty blender because it does begin to dry and set fairly quickly and by the time you get to the other eye the product will have set itself Does oxidize a BIT but I have found using a lighter shade or one with cool undertones instead of warm minimizes how obvious that is,0.168,0.0,0.832,0.9286,Positive

I ordered the color light and I have OLIVEtoned skin with a tendency toward oilinessIm new to using concealer for my under eye circles so I dont have much to compare this to  It seems to work on lightening my dark areas with decent pigmentation but it does settle into fine lines a bit and it doesnt stay in place as much as Id like it to  Im giving it 3 stars based on reasonable price good pigmentation color accuracy for my olive toned skin and the fact that this smells fine no strong obnoxious odorOverall I wish it had better staying power and didnt settle into my fine lines  Ill continue using this brand until I find a better alternative,0.229,0.074,0.697,0.9682,Positive
I dont think this concealer really covers enough to be considered a true concealer as its very light and sheer almost like a bb cream Its also very drying for a liquid The skin under your eyes is so delicate that the last thing you want is for it to become dry This product would probably do well on greasy oily skin but its not so good for normaldry,0.106,0.057,0.836,-0.1359,Negative

For this color to be 35 deep it is pretty light It is lighter than 30 Cafe which should not be the case Deep should be darker but its not But this is okay I bought it to highlight underneath my eyes anyway so I will definitely make it work But I think that Deep being way lighter than the color Cafe is just a manufacturer problem by Maybelline and maybe they need to reformulate it to make it darker But the concealer over all is pretty good It does not crease on me but everyone is different I just wanted to review this for my darker skinned ladies This lighter than expected so be cautious and maybe pick up 30 cafe,0.147,0.041,0.812,0.9337,Positive

For the Fit Me concealers this is their lightest color Im very fair yellow undertone NC15 and this concealer is too dark Its still usable thought because of the yellow undertones to cancel out under eye blueness but I need to blend with foundation color After work touch up sometimes needed gets bit cakey at the end of the day I also ordered a NYX concealer which was a much better color match bit lighter consistency,0.096,0.02,0.884,0.7092,Positive

It was darker than I expected but rather than waste it I decided to use it to do some slight contouring in the darker more hollow parts of my face and used a lighter concealer from a different line the Maybelline master conceal to highlight It actually worked well and since Im almost out of it now Im thinking about getting a new one but Im leaning towards using a slightly darker one from the Maybelline Master Conceal line instead However Id prefer a slightly darker concealer with cooler tones to match my skin better Im also debating whether its worth it or not Well see,0.108,0.053,0.839,0.7209,Positive

I usually mix this with my moisturizing gel to create a thin coverage over my face When used in this way the concealer works great If I dont dilute it I find that it is a bit heavy on my skin and settles into some of my creases over the course of the day However I love how this product is affordable and does not irritate or stimulate my acneprone skin Would repurchase,0.167,0.022,0.812,0.9015,Positive

My favorite concealer Very good both under eyes and on blemishes or acne scars Not drying or irritating for dry and sensitive skin Doesnt seem to cause me acne Its the easiest and smoothest formula of concealer Ive worked with and despite the fair color being a pink undertone and therefore not a perfect match for my yellow toned super light porcelain skinit blends right in and doesnt seem to be noticeable I would highly recommend this concealer for everyone to try but I dont if those that are quite oily will enjoy this or if it will have that great of lasting power on pretty oily skin,0.217,0.028,0.755,0.9727,Positive
I love this concealer I have tried a lot in the past and some a lot more expensive than this one that didnt give me nearly as good coverage For the price point this is a great all round concealer It was a little lighter than I expected but it works just fine at concealing the bags under my eyes and also any blemishes on my skin It also blends really well and doesnt cake at all I love this concealer,0.214,0.0,0.786,0.953,Positive

My favorite concealer Ive purchase this in sand and fair and love them both Sand is a little darker in more yellow based than fair They are both great for different reasons I tend to use the fair around my eyes and the sand around my nose between my eyes and on acne since it matches my skin better The fair is great for illuminating areas without being obviously shiny like an illuminator tends to do Ive tried many top brands at Sephora and this is still my favorite for the price,0.309,0.0,0.691,0.9859,Positive

Im usually a fan of Maybelline products the Dream Wonder Liquid is great but this is a big disappointment I wouldve been three maybe even four stars for its blendability and relative coverage even though it tends to create a crepey texture on dry skinHowever Ive noticed that the last tube I received was INCREDIBLY darker than my previous tubes I wasnt sent the wrong color it certainly said fair on the tube but it was almost a medium shade and very orange This is supposed to be the same  or perhaps even a bit lighter  than the Maybelline Ivoryporcelain foundations but it looked like I was wearing football grease paint I thought this mightve been a fluke so I looked the next time I was in CVS  and nope the concealer is noticeably darker  it even looked like the light shade a tad lighter One of my friends wears the darkest shade Cafe and she also noticed strong inconsistencies in the shade level and undertone,0.182,0.048,0.77,0.9686,Positive

The color is a nice match for me since Im buying it mostly for highlighting and covering dark circles under the eyesThe consistency is not that thick and its really easy to blendLasts for quite a decent 5hrs on my oily face with my favorite Rimmel powder without any primer onThe only down point is that I think the coverage of it is not as good as the Collection Lasting perfect Concealer,0.16,0.03,0.809,0.883,Positive
So far this is my favorite drugstore concealer I use it for my undereye area I also use it to highlight and contour This is a great to clean u the lip area when after applying liquid lipstick and also for creating a guide for shaping brows Once your fill in your brows you blend it out and it creates a soft highlight for your brow area It is a super blendable formula I am attaching a photo wear I used this concealer to help shape and highlight my brows Love this product,0.308,0.0,0.692,0.9836,Positive

I bought this to replace the expensive concealer that I had been using before and also because lots of people on Youtube love to use it I think this one does the job of a concealer which is to give enough coverage The problem of this product is that it doesnt last long After applying this I use the same brands Fit me foundation After 45 hours the makeup seemed to be floating on my face which might be because I didnt apply any primer and setting products and also I have a not terribly oil skin,0.099,0.028,0.873,0.786,Positive
I saw lots of the beauty gurus I follow on Youtube using and loving the Maybelline Fit Me concealer and thought I would give it a go I find that it is a bit thin for my liking and doesnt cover much of my undereye darkness I am very fair so I have darkness whether I am wellrested or not so I need something a bit more substantial than this I also find that it creases under my eyes when I smile throughout the day so I have to go over my makeup with a damp makeup sponge to pat it out smooth again It isnt bad but it isnt the best I have ever used,0.138,0.067,0.795,0.6015,Positive
This is a great replacement for my Nars creamy concealer It is not as creamy requires me to apply done eye cream prior to application as I have dry skin  nor does it have as much coverage For 17th of the cost closer to 18th on subscribe and save this will certainly be my everyday concealer For those looking for Nars concealer dupes I used custard in Nars and sand in the maybelline,0.126,0.0,0.874,0.8658,Positive

As Im getting older I am finding that the darkness under my eyes is getting more and more noticeable Ive never been able to find that perfect concealer so I keep searching and tryingI found this concealer has good coverage for imperfections but its lighter than expected It goes on smooth and doesnt draw attention to my fine linesId purchase again but will get a shade darker than I usually would,0.092,0.021,0.887,0.6124,Positive

I normally use this concealer in the shade 15 Fair and I like it just fine The only problem is it is not quite fair enough for my skin I have English ancestry and my skin is naturally very pale so I have trouble finding a concealer that is light enough for my skinSilly me I figured that the shade 10 would be lighter than the 15 but it is actually quite a bit darker and a totally different shade It is very yellow and does not match my skin tone at all It might work for someone with more of a golden undertone but its totally wrong for me and thus I cant use it for anything As a rule I would advise against purchasing concealer online if you dont know for sure that it will match your skin tone properly but I couldnt find this shade in any storesThat issue aside I like the consistency and the coverage is okay but it wont cover up dark spots very well because its translucent It does tend to wipe off pretty easily during the day as your skin produces more oil but will stay on fine if you dont touch your face too muchUpdate I have stopped using all Maybelline products because the company tests on animals,0.103,0.066,0.831,0.8062,Positive

This concealer cannot be paired with the SmoothDewy Fit Me Foundation Since the foundation itself is quite wet when you first put it on if you put the concealer on immediately after the foundation it doesnt stick The concealer slips and slides on the face and is hard to blend Its easier to use after the foundation has set for a bit but it still isnt a good mixLike the other Maybelline face products it is sheer which allows for a more buildable coverage,0.043,0.051,0.906,-0.1677,Negative

its ok not creaseless it really didnt help to conceal my dark circles It does smudge and a bit tacky though not sticky Its not too drying but I wish it was because itll certainly smudge less and will stay in place It is definitely not high coverage if you have really really really dark circles forget it this doesnt help but if you have mild dark circles then you should give this a try,0.139,0.092,0.768,0.61,Positive
Kind of wears away throughout the day but I dont bother reapplying because that is a pain Im switching products for this reason and also because it creases terribly under my eyes and makes it look like i have wrinkles and Ive not had a concealer do that before Its a great color match for fair skin though and provides really good coverage for pimples,0.231,0.115,0.654,0.8535,Positive

I had high expectations based on reviews but I am not blown away by this The coverage doesnt seem great As summer ends I am generally the second to lightest shade in most brands and the 15 was too light for me I have read comparisons between this and Nars concealer and having both there is no comparison Given how inexpensive this was I would be willing to try again with another color,0.0,0.099,0.901,-0.8042,Negative

I have no clue as to the longevity as Ive had it only a short time  Very pleased with the product though,0.136,0.094,0.769,0.2484,Positive
This is the best concealer for the money Ive found  It is as good as department store brands at a fraction of the price  No gray tones as other sometimes have  The applicator will put it into the deep pockets on either side of the nose where it is hard to get a finger to fit  I am a repeat user of this product,0.141,0.053,0.806,0.7906,Positive
It is not the best concealer because it does cake up Its blends out ok but not the best,0.066,0.277,0.657,-0.7299,Negative

This is now my number one concealer over the other expensive brands Ive bought before I highly recommend this one if you want a very effective product that will do the trick with very little at a time This is a narrow container but I see now that very little is needed to do the job so in this case Ladies size does not matter,0.102,0.035,0.863,0.4909,Positive

Decent quality concealer for a drugstore brand product Blends well but color maybe tricky to match your skin tone I use it under my baremineral so no big deal if color is lil off Applicator tip is easy to dab on your skin to conceal zits or blemishes Staying power is just ok works best if you use primer and setting powder on top,0.211,0.074,0.715,0.8885,Positive

Its very blue toned on me but it oxidizes and matches me alright after powdering MUCH fairer than shade 20 though they work together nicely to make a good neutral tone but they crease something terrible,0.225,0.092,0.684,0.7227,Positive

To clarify I have hooded lids and I usually just use concealer sticks to prime my eyes I decided to try my hand at a liquid primer since I never tried one before The ones I purchased were kind of dry and did not blend well into the color of my skin and I used a concealer brush at that It just looked like I ran a miniature paint roller over my eyelids At that point I didnt bother with shadow I just wiped it off And its not easy to get off either I guess I shouldnt have expected much from the beginning given the price Im aware that these work for some people but it most definitely did not work for me,0.08,0.027,0.893,0.7389,Positive

This is a very good undereye concealer  Pat it on gently set with powder and no touchups needed  You can pay 20 for other brands that are no better than this one  What a great price,0.287,0.126,0.587,0.8553,Positive
I was hesitant to buy concealer without seeing it in person but Ive been using this for a couple weeks and Im in love The coverage is great and its not too heavy and goes on smoothly I love that a little goes a long way and Ill definitely order again,0.315,0.079,0.606,0.9618,Positive
Had better concealers Doesnt work well on blemishes but its sort of good for bags under eyes and circles,0.235,0.062,0.703,0.6064,Positive
the concealer arrived on time well packaged have used it twice and like it,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.5574,Positive
Not the best concealer ever but certainly not the worst Not as full coverage as I would really like in a concealer though,0.369,0.072,0.559,0.8764,Positive
First time I liked the concealer Maybeline concealer is amazingconcealed my under nicely and the dark spot of acne was covered smoothly Before using this I was not satisfied with the looks after application Now I have no worries,0.129,0.167,0.704,-0.1611,Negative
This concealer goes on so well it doesnt leave dry patches or look cakey,0.245,0.0,0.755,0.4384,Positive
It seemed like there was barely any concealer even in the bottle There are many more concealers that are around the same price that you should spend your time to look into I wouldnt really recommend this,0.064,0.06,0.876,0.0447,Neutral
Always love this protect Its the best and works amazing,0.717,0.0,0.283,0.9451,Positive
Good coverage for my super dark circles  However it cakes very badly in any sort of wrinkle it can find  It actually might be making new ones just to hide in  I swear I looked older by the end of the day and might as not have been wearing makeup  I gave it one star back for blemish coverage which it is okay at not great as it also will cake in any dry skin around the pimple but covers angry red ones okay,0.09,0.123,0.787,-0.4667,Negative
I definitely think that this product is good for its price However coming from more highend concealers this formula was much more runny and caused slight irritationburning when applied It does provide coverage and is blendable and very buildable,0.135,0.0,0.865,0.6808,Positive

I hate this concealer can never get it to come out of the tube and the few times it did it wasnt anything special,0.0,0.221,0.779,-0.7147,Negative
This is a hard no for me Im fair and cool toned and  all the shades lean orange Also I found it gloppy and the applicator is unhygienic I had to use a brush or sponge I could wash I prefer Lancôme or LOréal,0.109,0.085,0.806,0.25,Positive
I had a SEVERE allergic reaction to this My eyes constantly watered and burned The skin around my eyes got soooooo raw I had to buy aquaphor and coat it down for days This was my experience using this product for one week Absolutely regretted it,0.0,0.174,0.826,-0.8139,Negative
I feel like this product does not do what it says hence the low rating it gets from my sideSurprised it would even be marketed as anything agerelated as I have found it to cake and crease everywhere and just sit on top of the skin like a clay mask Maybe it looks good on camera or in photos but to me this has been unwearable because of its thickness  For the record I use Max Factor pan sticks and other thick foundations and concealers therefore it isnt the consistency that bothered me but the effect I bought two tubes and ended up tossing them both unfortunately The packaging is also unhygienic and messy a lot of product gets stuck in the sponge and this concealer is also not that cheap in Europe The shade selection is ok I guess but overall this should perhaps be marketed for younger people as opposed to anyone who wants to rewind their age,0.058,0.08,0.861,-0.6908,Negative
Color match and consistency were good but this formula burned my eye area so badly I had to wash it off immediately My skin is somewhat but not extremely sensitive and this concealer caused a strong and immediate reaction unlike any other undereye concealer Ive ever used I know its a cult favorite but for me it went into the trash after the first use,0.143,0.075,0.782,0.6011,Positive
I like this concealer quite a bit The applicator is nice the sponge makes it easy to apply and blend the concealer evenly There is a decent shade selection The sponge does seem like it will be a bacteria magnet so I use this as much as I can Never for more than a couple months max The coverage is medium and not too heavy looking,0.163,0.0,0.837,0.8658,Positive
The coverage was good but i disliked the packaging I would never buy it again,0.118,0.215,0.667,-0.3818,Negative
This is my HG concealer I am yet to find something that is so skinlike doesnt accentuate fine lines or look cakey under my eyes It is seamless,0.0,0.058,0.942,-0.1511,Negative
This is my go to undereye concealer and has been for years I periodically try others but they always fall short compared to this This has a light formula very natural look and they actually make a shade match for my pale cool skin My undereyes area is nice no lines and no dark circles so admittedly that makes concealer easy I actually love the little attached sponge applicator I apply with that and then pat with a fingertip to blend because its easy to apply too much if you blend it with the attached sponge Best concealer Ive ever used for my undereye area Never fails Ill repurchase again and again if you have undereye lines and you put product over them its going in those lines no matter what thats not the concealer Its a physical feature of your face makeup doesnt cover texture and lines The more you put and the heavier the formula the more obvious it will be so theoretically this concealer is good for lined undereyes because of its lightness,0.199,0.041,0.76,0.9875,Positive
I was disappointed The coverage is not that great it doesnt look smooth a bit wet after application moves and creases lots Perhaps if u dont have actual dark circles this could work for u,0.0,0.181,0.819,-0.7502,Negative
This is my favorite concealer I bought it in fair which is a perfect match for my light pink toned skin I use it on my under eye area on the inner corners and on any discoloration This covers beautifully without looking heavy It doesnt crease or fade or accentuate fine lines I love the sponge applicator which makes applying very easy Its very affordable and available everywhere Ive tried high end concealers but I like this one the best I highly recommend,0.289,0.0,0.711,0.9755,Positive
This rocks It doesnt crease under my eyes is affordable and easy to find I will absolutely repurchase and recommend it to anyone who needs a good undereye concealer It gives me better results than concealers much more pricy Ive bought at Sephora and such,0.227,0.0,0.773,0.8876,Positive
Good product,0.744,0.0,0.256,0.4404,Positive
This concealer is apart of Maybellines permanent line and rightfully so Brightening is a bold understatement It instantly provides bright lights for your under eyes This product goes on thin light easy to apply and easy to blend and dries down slightly thicker more full coverage matte and stays without budging even to touch There is a reason why it has been around for a long time,0.214,0.0,0.786,0.9438,Positive
I am nw20 and tried so many shades but the new shade worked best Light Honey It is decent but it is not IME for those that have serious darkness under there eyes Great drugstore in a pinch option The new shade Light Honey is a much better match for my nw20 skin than any of the other shades they had before But on me this falls into that category of I keep applying it and it really isnt making a dent It does some muting but the darkness is still pretty apparent Again if you have just some mild darkness this would be a great option But for those of us that have the full under eye I got punched darknessthis again in my experience may not be enough,0.17,0.06,0.769,0.9694,Positive
I am sure that my foundation and this concealer has same formular silicone based and applied correctly but this foundation still creasing cakey and show pores horribly it destroys my beautiful natural texture of my foundation coverage is medium and blending is ok the packaging is unhygine Sorry if it work for you not for me Shade medium is good match for NCNW30,0.206,0.134,0.66,0.714,Positive
It has a very good coverage but also bear in mind that my undereye area is not very dark it just needs a little bit of brightness It can be dry so I put on my eye cream first and then I even use squalane oil on my beauty blender to blend this into my skin without any creases I use oil instead of setting it with a powder because I do not like matt finishes,0.132,0.034,0.834,0.8242,Positive
I found the actual concealer to be medium to full coverage and actually found the concealer really good I actually used mine for foundation and found it good in covering the acne and still providing a nonmakeup makeup finish I would however note that the sponge applicator is not great to constantly be reusing and the actual product finishes quickly for me However i would definitely recommend over the Maybelline fit me concealer,0.177,0.041,0.781,0.8687,Positive
Oh hey you know if youve spent any time on Instagram and watch tutorials and see Charlotte Tilbury contour and other high end foundations with this exact way of dispensing then you just know to buy this for 700 and save your money Foundation and concealer in a hygienic easy way of tapping on and having the same affect as CT and Armani Swatch it youll see  Happy 2020 you beautiful people  EDIT if this is balling up then youre using too much If you find the sponge to be unhygienic then take it off and wash it but really a doe foot is not terribly hygienic either or fingers This is a no brainer for touch ups ,0.102,0.022,0.875,0.8375,Positive
Tbh this is overhyped It settles more into my fine lines than the apieu moist creamy concealer and has less coverage to boot Its also more expensive The only plus is that its far more accessible than most Korean makeup brands but Id rather take the trouble to order something online thats cheaper and I know works better  I find many Korean roadshop concealers have bomb coverage and frequently come with added SPF  which can only be a plus for preventing dark marks from getting any darker,0.058,0.096,0.846,-0.56,Negative
Maybeline has finally introduced this in Japan and Ive been wearing this concealer for the first time for the last two weeks Its quite nice for the price Good points high coverage with just a tiny bit of product wont settle too much into fine lines if you use a tiny bit of product good color range decent staying power The bad points as everyone else has already said the stupid sponge tip applicator and the fact that it can be a bit too drying this can be mediated if you moisturize the under eye area really well and use just a pinhead amount I still like my Phyto Sisley and Cle de Peau the one in the clicky stick with the brush concealers better and will always pick those up for a special evening but those are way more expensive so to give my wallet a break I dont much mind using Maybeline on a daily basis In summer though Catrice Camouflage will beat all other concealers hands down,0.086,0.026,0.888,0.7305,Positive
Good medium coverage creamy formula that is easy to work with I use this both for undereye circles and for blemishes on my face different shades though of course Will rub off a bit throughout the day for longer wear Id recommend some primer  setting powder to get it to stay put on oily skin,0.142,0.0,0.858,0.8074,Positive
I have not been a fan of under eye concealers because they usually settle into my fine linesbut this concealer has changed my mind This stuff is a miracle It actually tightens my undereye area completely covers darkness and brightens my eyes like nothing else I am just amazed I dont apply heavily but just dab my finger onto the sponge and then lightly around my eyes It doesnt require setting with powder and lasts all day And the price is just awesome as well I have the Light color which is perfect for my light to medium warmneutral skin tone I will be buying this for ever Maybelline please do not cancel this product,0.219,0.025,0.756,0.9741,Positive
I have tried this many times over the years since it was new I have aged my skin has changed etc and I have used the neutralizer the brightener and the shade light  each on their own and in combinations when inclined I never liked these Perhaps I should specify that I have never liked an undereye concealer I simply kept giving it a shot with hope and different products underneath etc to see if maybe I would love it These always flat out suck Thick cakey and if tweaked to be otherwise Disastrous looking Just putting it in print that not all holy grails on cosmetic platforms are always worthwhile,0.117,0.097,0.786,0.3476,Positive
There is definitely a lot of hype for this concealer it is all over YouTube and the internet I remember trying this out a long time ago and not liking it for some reason I got the lightest available in Walmart which was 100 Ivory which is a pretty good match is a little yellow though and does a great job with brightening despite not being lighter then my skin tone and concealing my undereyes Not full coverage more of medium high medium but still covers a good amount of discolouration I really like how easily this blends compared to the Creamy Concealer by Maybelline which I have to work a little for it to blend this one blends effortlessly with just a couple of pats with a sponge,0.167,0.012,0.821,0.959,Positive
This is interesting Ive used this concealer years ago when it first came out and what called my attention was how full coverage it was Now years later I tried it again and it is more watery has less coverage Medium at best but i find it much more moisturizing and actually helping with dark circlesi know shocking So for aging under eyes I find it great now Recommended,0.192,0.045,0.763,0.8898,Positive
Yeah i dont know why people are so into this even Tati recommended this and i thought i should try One of the worst ones ive tried it started to roll off in nasty bits from my skin right when i was applying it and then after just few hours i tried to touch up and it did it again,0.064,0.123,0.813,-0.6908,Negative
I didnt like the sponge applicator Good creamy concealer for everyday use Will buy again,0.17,0.124,0.705,0.1999,Positive
This concealer has a lot of hype around it which to some extent is justified It applies nicely blends well and looks much like skin when dried down unlike some products which cling to every bit of texture I would call it a satinmatte finish  not so matte that it dries your skin but is in no way radiant,0.176,0.044,0.781,0.7543,Positive
I dont like this I know its really popular and I feel like I must be missing something I actually even repurchased it a year or two after having thrown it away thinking I must have had a bad one or that maybe I had to work with it a bit No still dont like it It makes my undereye area look horrible I tried the brightener or whatever its called once and then I tried it in fair I didnt like either I could not make it work for me Not as an undereye concealer or for any other use Really unflattering and under the eyes very aging Im not bothered by the applicator I love Maybelline I find a lot of their foundations to be really good And their Fit Me concealer and powders are wonderful But this is really a pass for me,0.109,0.098,0.792,0.3724,Positive

it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

personally recommend to always mix it,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
with the other version I feel like it,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive

because this one doesnt emphasize three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

personally I think theres some positive,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.5574,Positive
and negatives about both of these,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally I kind of find a solution,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
pretty easily especially whenever its,0.651,0.0,0.349,0.6808,Positive
something is so affordable I tend to try,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and just find a easy fix that makes them,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
worth it so for this one for example,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
like I said just the poor primers and,0.236,0.292,0.472,-0.1531,Negative
powder youre good to go,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
and this one which is the reason I only,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have my summer shade I tend to use this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
during the summer because it does help,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
control the oils and during the summer I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont have two eye patches so I dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have to deal with it during the winter I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just usually mix it with this one which,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is why this one is like super light I,0.516,0.0,0.484,0.7506,Positive
have the shade 110 so I either reuse,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this on its own or mix them together and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I feel like it makes it perfect combo,0.554,0.0,0.446,0.7351,Positive
that doesnt emphasize the dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so other than that you can see the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage is really good on my forehead,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
its not perfect but I usually dont,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.2498,Negative
tend to go for like super full coverage,0.516,0.0,0.484,0.7506,Positive
on a daily basis so I think these are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
perfect for that it covered mostly,0.425,0.0,0.575,0.5719,Positive
everything you can see you can see a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit of redness on this side to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fit anyone does it have as,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
coverage button on the forehead its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
still pretty good you can see by the way,0.466,0.0,0.534,0.7269,Positive
that the colors are pretty much matching,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
now in my face because it has oxidized,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all my hand is gonna take a little,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
longer because its a little thicker but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so if you were wondering if you have 125,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
120 will match you once its oxidized so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay so I did do the rest of my makeup,0.192,0.0,0.808,0.2263,Positive
theres actually oil coming so if you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like that I like coming but I wanted to,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.3612,Positive
show you what the foundations look like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
with the powder and everything on top so,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
Im gonna zoom you and kind of like I,0.24,0.0,0.76,0.2975,Positive
have mentioned I dont think the powder,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
changes the fact that it doesnt besides,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dry patches the pores are pretty much,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
you know normal to gone looking and this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
side I do feel like the pores are a,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
little less visible once you powder but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I mean we all have pores right so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont really blame the foundation and,0.311,0.0,0.689,0.3078,Positive
again like I said using a pore primer if,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
you are really looking to a poreless,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
look can definitely fix that issue and I,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
dont feel like it emphasizes my dry,0.0,0.26,0.74,-0.2755,Negative
patches as much now the foundation you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can see its fully oxidized now so Im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gonna apply it you like fresh swatch,0.49,0.0,0.51,0.5859,Positive
next to it so you can see how much it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
does oxidize it yeah so you can see it,0.216,0.0,0.784,0.296,Positive
is pretty oranjee compared to the shade,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
it was but if you keep that in mind I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont think its DUP difficult to find,0.0,0.294,0.706,-0.3612,Negative
your shade and Im gonna swatch the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
other one next to it just so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cuz I do think that 125 looks pretty,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
close to 120 of the full coverage once,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its socialized so you can see its good,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
in the middle I guess although the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
foundation is quite thick there I dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feel like on my face theres a,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
difference between the two right now so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so Im gonna go on with my day and I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
will be updating you probably once,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
before the energy day is currently 10,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
oclock in the morning so I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wearing this for at least 10 hours and I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention that I do have really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oily skin although during the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its not as bad but around like five or,0.425,0.0,0.575,0.634,Positive
six hours its usually when I have to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
retouch the powder and everything so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
will be doing that I hope be doing that,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
on camera whenever I feel the need to so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its nothing like the foundation are not,0.0,0.26,0.74,-0.2755,Negative
responsible for that its definitely,0.625,0.0,0.375,0.6124,Positive
just me having very oily skin in general,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but again I will update you to zoom ins,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and everything and keep you updated so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know how I said I would come back in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like five six hours touch it up that,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
didnt happen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because I do not need to I dont know if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its because its winter my skin hasnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
been as oily its legit than ten hours,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its like eight oclock at night and Im,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
just starting to feel shiny and seeing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
some changes theres a reason this is a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Holy Grail foundation and why Ive been,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like dying to talk about this one,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
theyre just really great I do however I,0.468,0.0,0.532,0.659,Positive
want to say that since I didnt touch up,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
the powder whatsoever and Im starting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to boil II Ive noticed that this side,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is a little more cakey into my pores,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which again makes sense as I did notice,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that from the beginning the dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
are the same it hasnt become more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
drying and I do feel like Im a little,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
bit more oily on this side than this one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so hopefully you can see it but I feel,0.222,0.0,0.778,0.2492,Positive
you can see my Porter a little bit more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on this side than this one and I do you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feel like Im a little bit more oily,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
thats definitely harder to see but its,0.236,0.0,0.764,0.2144,Positive
just how I feel right now so really I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
love both fun they shouldnt do both,0.6,0.0,0.4,0.8176,Positive
favorites I do think they have like you,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
know their pros and cons but I wanted to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try and reapply I dont have any paper,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to remove the oil so Im just gonna use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
toilet paper classy Im just gonna try,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
to remove some oil and just see  show,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you how they perform,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
after being reapplied because its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
always nice to see that the foundation,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
doesnt become cake you and your reply,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but I cant already know but I just want,0.195,0.0,0.805,0.1154,Positive
to show you so Im gonna be here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
applying some this batter on top so for,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
the pores after applying I feel like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
this one is definitely a less visible,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
this one a little bit more and Ive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
noticed now I dont know if if Ive been,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
touching my face that definitely happens,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
but I feel like this side might be a,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
little bit more uneven like little bits,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.4173,Positive
that might have like separated and moved,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
around a little bit more than this side,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I said this one is still perfectly even,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
personally Im finding Im keeping on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wearing at both of these foundations I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
think theyre really fantastic do real,0.438,0.0,0.562,0.5984,Positive
affordable I think theyre really great,0.523,0.0,0.477,0.659,Positive
if you want something that is a little,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
bit more lightweight a little bit less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but doesnt emphasize the pores,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whatsoever this one if you want,0.206,0.0,0.794,0.0772,Positive
something with a little bit more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage and even if you have dry skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
maybe just moisturize probably,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
beforehand but I would also give this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one a shot usually full,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
race relations and Dreskin dont go well,0.0,0.232,0.768,-0.2057,Negative
together but I think this one would be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
totally worth the shot you might want to,0.368,0.0,0.632,0.3597,Positive
touch up the powder a little sooner with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one so it doesnt become a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patchy but I mean Ive been wearing it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for 10 hours like if it lasts in hours I,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive

Ive been trying out too this foundation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the foundation Im talking about is the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
maybelline superstay full coverage 24,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hour foundation apparently this is a new,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and improved formula they used to,0.383,0.0,0.617,0.4767,Positive
actually have this foundation but I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
never tried it when they used to have it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they just continued it and now they,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brought it back and its supposed to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a better formula so unfortunately I,0.382,0.355,0.263,0.0534,Positive
dont have the old formula to compare it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to so everything is just based off of my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
opinions and thoughts on the new and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
improved foundation but I was so excited,0.609,0.0,0.391,0.7371,Positive

Ulta calm I picked mine up on Amazon for,0.4,0.0,0.6,0.4588,Positive

what retailer you go to but its around,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
10 to 12 dollars and it looks like it,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive

sponge on the side and see how it works,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

cakey,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my first thoughts about the Beauty,0.388,0.0,0.612,0.5859,Positive
Blender side I actually kind of like how,0.269,0.0,0.731,0.2975,Positive
the brush side applied this time usually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it is beauty burner that usually wins,0.6,0.0,0.4,0.8176,Positive
but I dont know what it was maybe its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just the formula I feel like it worked,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
really beautifully with a brush the,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.6115,Positive
sponge site looks really nice too,0.382,0.0,0.618,0.4754,Positive
huh both sides look really good I dont,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
know but I kind of liked the application,0.352,0.0,0.648,0.5041,Positive
with the brush better typically I apply,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
foundation like with a brush first and,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
then I Pat it out with a sponge anyway,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so I usually use both okay,0.322,0.0,0.678,0.2263,Positive
I am so impressed by the coverage of,0.361,0.0,0.639,0.5256,Positive
this the finish of this so far,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
super good Im going to go ahead and,0.531,0.0,0.469,0.7783,Positive
finish up my makeup if I scoot up a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit can you guys see you a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better hopefully its not too washed out,0.528,0.0,0.472,0.6808,Positive
but that finish is so beautiful you,0.538,0.0,0.462,0.8396,Positive
wouldnt know that I had acne and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and scars underneath this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
nation I feel like it looks so good so,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.7384,Positive
Im gonna finish up my makeup really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quickly and then Ill be back to do a,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.4215,Negative
little checkin and then we will see how,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this works throughout the day okay so I,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
just finished my makeup I didnt do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
anything crazy cuz Im not really going,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.34,Negative
anywhere today and I really wanted to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
focus on the foundation so I used a lot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of cream products actually which blended,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
over the foundation beautifully I felt,0.481,0.0,0.519,0.5719,Positive
the foundation has kind of a powdery,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
finish so I only set my under eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
concealer and tiny bit down the center,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the face because thats where I tend,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to get oily but I really left the rest,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as is I really want to see how this,0.185,0.0,0.815,0.1513,Positive
wears throughout the day because it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kind of more of a matte powdery finish,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
off the bat I wonder if it gets a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit more dewy towards the other day or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if it stays like this for hours and,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
hours I have to say Im so in love with,0.359,0.0,0.641,0.6682,Positive
the finish right now I really hope that,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
this wears out the day well we will see,0.208,0.0,0.792,0.2732,Positive

pores are a tiny bit accentuated right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose area here which could,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
probably be fixed with like a good,0.574,0.0,0.426,0.6597,Positive
primer or a pore filling primer Im so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
impressed at how it stayed on the side,0.307,0.0,0.693,0.4767,Positive
of my face because a lot of times,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
throughout the day I touch my face and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

havent even looked at my face all day,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
long my nose theres some foundation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
missing because I made a spicy soup,0.0,0.355,0.645,-0.296,Negative
tonight and every time I eat spicy food,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I love spicy food but like it makes my,0.494,0.0,0.506,0.705,Positive
nose run so I was I wiped my nose anyway,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lets take a look at the foundation Im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kind of seeing the same thing that I saw,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yesterday theres a really nice sheen it,0.382,0.0,0.618,0.4754,Positive
doesnt look very oily I mean Im kind,0.362,0.0,0.638,0.5267,Positive
of my forehead kinda looks a little bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oily and today again I powdered the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
entire face but I honestly I havent,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.6124,Positive
touched up all day I ran errands and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is what it looks like I dont mind,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
it I feel like itd be really easy to,0.487,0.0,0.513,0.6901,Positive
touch up the thing I do like about it,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
that Ive noticed the past couple of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
days of wearing it is even though it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
does kind of develop a dewy finish it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt ever separate on my skin which,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sometimes if that happens throughout the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
day if my skin gets a little oily,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sometimes it causes the foundation to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
break up so I do like that it doesnt do,0.258,0.0,0.742,0.4173,Positive
that and it would be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
easy just to kind of take a blotting,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
sheet or some powder and just kind of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dust over the tzone or wherever you get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oily,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I dont mind it getting dewy on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
outer parts of the face I think thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really beautiful but usually like this,0.594,0.0,0.406,0.7047,Positive
area this area I dont love for it to be,0.0,0.296,0.704,-0.5216,Negative
shiny but I mean this is a good what six,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.5927,Positive
hours of wear so I think thats pretty,0.366,0.0,0.634,0.5367,Positive
good I think its really come off my,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
skin except for around my nose where I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
touched it but I do already notice and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really appreciate that about the,0.428,0.0,0.572,0.4576,Positive
foundation so that is the situation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
before today its kind of funny I wonder,0.303,0.0,0.697,0.3832,Positive
if because its marketed as a matte,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
foundation and because at the beginning,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the day it kind of does feel really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
matte and really tight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im wonder if on my skin my skin kind of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like over produces oil because it is,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
trying to mattify that could just be my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin type I dont know so I want to kind,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.6603,Positive
of try to test it out again with maybe a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
primer that can combat a little bit of,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.34,Negative
oil in the tzone but so far honestly,0.387,0.0,0.613,0.6616,Positive
really liking this foundation the fact,0.374,0.0,0.626,0.4576,Positive
that its drugstore is that much better,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
I will do my final checkin tomorrow,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with you guys and then kind of do an,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
overall review and give you guys my full,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thoughts on this foundation so I will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
see you guys tomorrow all right you guys,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so Ive had the chance to wear this for,0.2,0.0,0.8,0.25,Positive
several days now and I think Im ready,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to give a final review so honestly I,0.436,0.0,0.564,0.5949,Positive
really do like this foundation the fact,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.4173,Positive
that its drugstore makes it that much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better I will say it looks so flawless,0.588,0.0,0.412,0.7987,Positive
upon application it is what Im wearing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right now the coverage is incredible if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre into full coverage foundations I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
would recommend grabbing this the only,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
thing that Im unsure of is if you have,0.0,0.2,0.8,-0.25,Negative
dry skin just because some of the areas,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if I do have a little bit of dryness it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kind of clings but my skin is not that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dry right now so Im really not able to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
give a full review as far as dry skin is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
concerned thats the only unfortunate,0.0,0.429,0.571,-0.4588,Negative
thing about doing foundation review,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sometimes is I can only give feedback,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
based off of my skin type which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
normal combination so sometimes I do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have dry patches right now I dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really have too many so I cant really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tell you and then also like I mentioned,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
I think earlier for some reason by the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
end of the day this foundation looks a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit dewy on me and since its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
supposed to be a super matte full,0.438,0.0,0.562,0.5994,Positive
coverage foundation that kind of like,0.306,0.0,0.694,0.2975,Positive
threw me off its not dewy in a bad,0.289,0.0,0.711,0.431,Positive
and sometimes on my skin if I use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
products that are to mattify,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it actually can increase the oil,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
production in my skin because my skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feels so dry and its like trying to,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
hydrate or rehydrate itself so I found,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that with some products that are super,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5994,Positive
mattifying that that does happen and so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that may be whats happening with me I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont know though if somebody has oily,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin and youve tried this new and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
improved version of this foundation,0.437,0.0,0.563,0.4767,Positive
would you please leave a comment down,0.307,0.16,0.533,0.2732,Positive
below and let me know if that happens to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you on oily skin or if it really does,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
help control the oils because it ends up,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
looking do a baby in a day it didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
look early though I guess I should say,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that so it didnt look greasy it just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
looked dewy which I personally dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mind on my skin type but it was kind of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
surprising just because when you first,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
apply it it kind of feels powdery and a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit heavy and a little bit tight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the skin at least for me and then by,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the end of the day it was just kind of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like more dewy and radiant and kind of,0.494,0.0,0.506,0.7063,Positive
had a different finish than when I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
started so thats what Ive noticed as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
far as the finish goes as far as like,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
the wear time I have not seen it fade,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
away and thats one thing I really do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
love about this foundation is because a,0.457,0.0,0.543,0.6369,Positive
lot of times especially around like my,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.4173,Positive
chin area where I do have blemishes and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
acne scarring some foundations by the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
end of the day can wear off their,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because I do kind of rest my hands on my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
face I touch my face a little bit and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this did say it was transfer resistant,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which I didnt actually test should I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
test that lets take my shirt hey guys,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im not like wiping but if you just,0.0,0.182,0.818,-0.1419,Negative
leaned up against something it didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
come off of my black shirt so I think it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is transfer resistant that was a fun,0.398,0.0,0.602,0.5106,Positive
little test but what was he saying Oh a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lot of other foundations tend to kind of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fade away around my acne scars and this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one really didnt I found that it had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
full coverage throughout the entire time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that I was wearing it so I really did,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like that the only time that it broke up,0.203,0.228,0.569,-0.0772,Negative
was a little bit around my nose but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
overall I really do like the finish of,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.4173,Positive
it again though I am a superduper fan,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
of full coverage foundations especially,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
full coverage matte foundations or semi,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
matte foundations so if you are too I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
would recommend picking this up again,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
that is just based off of my skin type,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im curious to see what you guys think,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
about it if you do try it out please let,0.204,0.0,0.796,0.3182,Positive
me,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but I do think I will continue to wear,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this and keep trying it out in different,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tutorials and keep trying it out with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
primers and things I didnt really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
notice too much of a difference when I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
use different kinds of primers as far as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
how at war and as far as like how it,0.174,0.271,0.556,-0.34,Negative
looked at the end of the day I will say,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when I set my entire face it looked a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit less dewy than it did when I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
didnt do that but it still like looks,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.5023,Positive
dewy whether I powder the entire face or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whether I dont do that so those are my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thoughts as far as priming and setting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
goes so in a nutshell I would recommend,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
this foundation Im not sure if I would,0.0,0.246,0.754,-0.2411,Negative
recommend it to people with extremely,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
dry skin just because it is a little bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more of a mattifying powdery finish,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
foundation which could accentuate some,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dry patches if you do have some I would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
recommend it its drugstore its twelve,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
dollars or less and its worth a shot,0.214,0.0,0.786,0.1621,Positive
so thats everything in a nutshell I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really do like this foundation on a,0.357,0.0,0.643,0.4173,Positive
scale of one to ten I think I would put,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it at a seven and a half maybe something,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to have to eight just because it does,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
change finishes on me so that doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mean that I would have to kind of powder,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the tzone if I wore it all throughout,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the day to kind of control the oils in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that section but other than that I feel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like I can really trust it to last all,0.504,0.0,0.496,0.7264,Positive
day which I really do like so seven and,0.284,0.0,0.716,0.4173,Positive
a half  eight stars out of ten thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
how I feel and its a great price so,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.6249,Positive

its like very very popular for a good,0.693,0.0,0.307,0.8416,Positive
reason but you just came out with this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
foundation this is the super state full,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5994,Positive
coverage foundation and this one has,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more coverage and its a little bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
different and I wanted to wear both of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these on half off my face all day long,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so you can see them in action because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its always great to hear a review but,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
its even better if you can see it in,0.266,0.0,0.734,0.4404,Positive
person so Im gonna be applying both of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these with Beauty blenders basically I,0.487,0.0,0.513,0.5859,Positive
just personally like using sponges,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
because it gives you the most natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
finish if you want more coverage you can,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
always lose a brush so on my right to,0.0,0.278,0.722,-0.4019,Negative
your left Im going to be applying the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fit me foundation the colors I have like,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.6124,Positive
my summer shades so they will be a bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dark for me but were just gonna blend,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that until my neck and pretend,0.0,0.219,0.781,-0.1027,Negative
everything is okay,0.487,0.0,0.513,0.2263,Positive
should have zoomed you in but youll see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the final result,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can Nestle seed align the middle of my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
face but you can see I did have a couple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of like redness and it covered,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but everything else still looks like,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
and its great it kind of has eight like,0.485,0.0,0.515,0.765,Positive
Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt make the test result just effect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately so on my other face but half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of my face Ive been buying this one I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try to go and get to color that was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closest to it but spoiler alert it does,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
packaging theyre very similar but are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we so so happy that they came out with a,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.726,Positive
pump like this should have had a pub,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
like I wish hopefully they will add a,0.725,0.0,0.275,0.7845,Positive
pump to this foundation because its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great but its such a to just try,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
and pour it on your head and then put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but it also looks very very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the final result,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can Nestle seed align the middle of my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

of like redness and it covered,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but everything else still looks like,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive

Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt make the test result just effect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately so on my other face but half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of my face Ive been buying this one I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try to go and get to color that was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closest to it but spoiler alert it does,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
packaging theyre very similar but are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we so so happy that they came out with a,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.726,Positive
pump like this should have had a pub,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
like I wish hopefully they will add a,0.725,0.0,0.275,0.7845,Positive
pump to this foundation because its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great but its such a to just try,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
and pour it on your head and then put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but everything else still looks like,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive

Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt make the test result just effect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately so on my other face but half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of my face Ive been buying this one I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try to go and get to color that was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closest to it but spoiler alert it does,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
packaging theyre very similar but are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we so so happy that they came out with a,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.726,Positive
pump like this should have had a pub,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
like I wish hopefully they will add a,0.725,0.0,0.275,0.7845,Positive
pump to this foundation because its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great but its such a to just try,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
and pour it on your head and then put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but it also looks very very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose and I do think that this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is emphasizing it which is why I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally recommend to always mix it,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive

makes the like perfect foundation,0.674,0.0,0.326,0.7351,Positive
because this one doesnt emphasize three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the final result,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can Nestle seed align the middle of my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

of like redness and it covered,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but everything else still looks like,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
and its great it kind of has eight like,0.485,0.0,0.515,0.765,Positive
Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt make the test result just effect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately so on my other face but half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of my face Ive been buying this one I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try to go and get to color that was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closest to it but spoiler alert it does,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
packaging theyre very similar but are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we so so happy that they came out with a,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.726,Positive
pump like this should have had a pub,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
like I wish hopefully they will add a,0.725,0.0,0.275,0.7845,Positive
pump to this foundation because its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great but its such a to just try,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
and pour it on your head and then put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but it also looks very very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose and I do think that this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is emphasizing it which is why I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally recommend to always mix it,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
with the other version I feel like it,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
makes the like perfect foundation,0.674,0.0,0.326,0.7351,Positive
because this one doesnt emphasize three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the super stay at full coverage,0.438,0.0,0.562,0.5994,Positive
foundation definitely has more coverage,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive

the dry patches around my nose as much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive

Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt make the test result just effect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately so on my other face but half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of my face Ive been buying this one I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try to go and get to color that was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closest to it but spoiler alert it does,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
packaging theyre very similar but are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we so so happy that they came out with a,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.726,Positive
pump like this should have had a pub,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
like I wish hopefully they will add a,0.725,0.0,0.275,0.7845,Positive
pump to this foundation because its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great but its such a to just try,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
and pour it on your head and then put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but it also looks very very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose and I do think that this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is emphasizing it which is why I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally recommend to always mix it,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
with the other version I feel like it,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
makes the like perfect foundation,0.674,0.0,0.326,0.7351,Positive
because this one doesnt emphasize three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the super stay at full coverage,0.438,0.0,0.562,0.5994,Positive
foundation definitely has more coverage,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive

the dry patches around my nose as much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive

show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but it also looks very very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose and I do think that this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is emphasizing it which is why I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally recommend to always mix it,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
with the other version I feel like it,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
makes the like perfect foundation,0.674,0.0,0.326,0.7351,Positive
because this one doesnt emphasize three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches whatsoever so if you have dry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the super stay at full coverage,0.438,0.0,0.562,0.5994,Positive
foundation definitely has more coverage,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive

the dry patches around my nose as much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
however I do think it emphasizes the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pores a little bit more right here where,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they tend to beep I mean most humans,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the final result,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can Nestle seed align the middle of my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

of like redness and it covered,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but everything else still looks like,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive

Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the final result,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can Nestle seed align the middle of my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

of like redness and it covered,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but everything else still looks like,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive

Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt make the test result just effect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately so on my other face but half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of my face Ive been buying this one I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try to go and get to color that was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closest to it but spoiler alert it does,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
packaging theyre very similar but are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we so so happy that they came out with a,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.726,Positive
pump like this should have had a pub,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
like I wish hopefully they will add a,0.725,0.0,0.275,0.7845,Positive
pump to this foundation because its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great but its such a to just try,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
and pour it on your head and then put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but it also looks very very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose and I do think that this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is emphasizing it which is why I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally recommend to always mix it,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
with the other version I feel like it,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive

of like redness and it covered,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
everything pretty well you can still see,0.515,0.0,0.485,0.6486,Positive
beauty marks so its not like full full,0.312,0.195,0.493,0.3456,Positive
coverage but it covered everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I really wanted to cover but if I had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a breakout or something I could,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
just use concealer wherever I need it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but everything else still looks like,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
skin thats why I absolutely love it,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.6697,Positive
probably why everyone seems to love it,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive

Demi matte finish I will be setting it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with powder just because its what I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
usually do it and want to make sure that,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
my own skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt make the test result just effect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately so on my other face but half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of my face Ive been buying this one I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
try to go and get to color that was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closest to it but spoiler alert it does,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wanted to mention by the way the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
packaging theyre very similar but are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we so so happy that they came out with a,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.726,Positive
pump like this should have had a pub,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
like I wish hopefully they will add a,0.725,0.0,0.275,0.7845,Positive
pump to this foundation because its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great but its such a to just try,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.3716,Positive
and pour it on your head and then put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on my face so I really appreciate that,0.353,0.0,0.647,0.5059,Positive
they finally added a pump I will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention definitely I have this shade at,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one to you but this one doesnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidize so not a problem here so Im,0.297,0.0,0.703,0.3687,Positive
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you but basically I like that the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5023,Positive
coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coverage but it also looks very very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose and I do think that this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is emphasizing it which is why I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally recommend to always mix it,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive

makes the like perfect foundation,0.674,0.0,0.326,0.7351,Positive
because this one doesnt emphasize three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

oxidize so this one will be at first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter and hopefully it will be so my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
close to it once it oxidized I just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

doing it closeup so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in texture of foundations so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the newest fullcoverage one is thicker,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost like a a little bit moosie,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
consistency and me fit me is definitely,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
a lot more liquidy so were gonna try in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a cover I do have a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redness and a few breakouts so well see,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4101,Positive
the coverage but yes again warning at,0.305,0.266,0.429,0.1154,Positive
first its gonna be way lighter I didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

125 and in this one I have the shade 120,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im gonna add a swatch on my hands so I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can wait a few minutes and then swatch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it again so we can see how much oxidize,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how the color compare once they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxidized so I can show you that how the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors compare and i will be swatching,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

coverage of this one is more natural,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
they fit me actually I should hold them,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
to the foundation as Im talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so this side has a little less,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

natural I dont feel like it emphasizes,0.29,0.245,0.465,0.1002,Positive
my pores as much but I do have two eye,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
patches around my nose its the winter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so my skin will tend to have dry patches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around my nose and I do think that this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is emphasizing it which is why I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

makes the like perfect foundation,0.674,0.0,0.326,0.7351,Positive
because this one doesnt emphasize three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the dry patches around my nose as much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

I am very fair neutral with noticeable dark circles as well as a combination sensitive skin type Their lightest shade is too dark but I use it for colour correcting When I apply it it burns really badly for a bit but then stops really suddenly Thought maybe my skin was just being sensitive so I kept using it After a couple of days I developed these hot pink spots almost like burst capillaries everywhere I use the concealer eyelids and undereyes Took a couple of days of not using it to go away Never had this reaction to makeup before and the very sheer coverage makes it very unworth it It is very light and somewhat buildable though if your circles are minimal and it doesnt burn I could see why youd like it However I do find that it separates over a couples hours So either the formula sucks or Ive been sold an expired concealer,0.057,0.062,0.881,-0.416,Negative

Lol I thought i was the only one that experienced the burning sensation under my eyes Since none of the beauty gurus video mentioned any of this I dont really reach for the maybelline fit me concealer because of the burning sensation it gives if I dont blend it fast I find myself reaching for the LA Girl pro concealer more and it doesnt burn my under eye area I only use tarte shape tape concealer for more fuller coverage on occasions because it can be too thick for everyday look LA Girl pro concealer works best than this maybelline fit me although I repurchased multiple times before trying the LA Girl i ran out of the LA Girl pro concealer and I just had to repurchase because its better than the maybelline one ,0.121,0.032,0.847,0.9069,Positive

I started using that concealer two years ago and it stung under my eyes too It also doesnt blend that well into my skin I switched to the cover girl ready set gorgeous concealer and I actually prefer that one over this one It blends into my skin better brightens my under eye However there isnt that much coverage but I prefer that because I like natural makeup since I dont wear foundation,0.19,0.019,0.791,0.901,Positive
When I first started using it it stung under my eyes too Since Ive started using the Banana Bright eye cream theres no more stinging So maybe the skin is dry and thats why it stings similar to some lotions on dry hands,0.064,0.049,0.887,0.1779,Positive

This is my go to concealer   I set it right away so it doesn39t crease Even with eye cream my under eyes can still be very dry some days On those days I tap in the powder with a slightly damp sponge brAfter using it awhile if the sponge becomes yucky looking I just pull it off amp throw it away The concealer will still come up thru the top with the sponge off I apply it with my fingers then sponge set as usual brI hope you39re enjoying using it The only other one I use but it39s pricey is the Clinique Airbrush Concealer This Maybelline one is a pretty good dupe for it I think the Age Rewind costs less at Walmart than at Ulta brI hope you39re doing well today Kristi and have a wonderful rest of the week ,0.165,0.034,0.802,0.9643,Positive

I have the Fit Me Concealer in two different shades and I purchased The Age Rewind Concealer so many times already as well I used to be obsessed with it but I think the performance changes after a while from opening it Because as you said I noticed that it started look more dry and showing my fine lines more I also really like the L39Oreal True Match Concealer and I think it39s actually my favourite from the drugstore at the moment Great video lovely ,0.255,0.014,0.73,0.9744,Positive

Fit me the wand is inside the tube however the rewind age concealer the sponge only got a lid so if it falls or sits there attracting bacteria the results of bacteria isn39t shown straight away it takes time with age to see the resultsbrIt39s not about putting sponge on the face it39s how make up is handledbrbrSome people get the bacteria results fast some people don39t that39s the fussbrBacteria creates alot of problems such as acne ecoli acanthaeomba which can actually blind youbrIf you didn39t get any reaction chances of it you might getting it laterbrTo eliminate the chance is best to avoid it the fuss is not to get sick,0.159,0.059,0.782,0.8934,Positive
