Love it so far! Yes, very light and soft touch to use.
Out of the box the X1 Carbon is an impressive machine.  Very light weight and aesthetically pleasing.  The keyboard is a pleasure to use and the touchpad is much better than other PCs I've recently used.  The model I have has the standard 1920 x 1080 display which is fine for an ultraportable.  Should you desire something comparable to a Mac Retina display, I recommend upgrading to the Lenovo hi-res HDR display.  For typical business use - email, MS Office, web browsing, video conferencing, etc., the Intel 8th Gen i5 processor, 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM configuration is fine.  The X1 also has a good array of ports including USB A-type, USB-C/Thunderbolt, and HDMI.  After a few days of use, battery life is impressive -- probably 10 hours with web browsing, Office, and email usage.  The only knock I'd give it in terms of hardware is the lid has a lot of flex to it, but I suppose this is to be expected since it's not aluminum.  The other negative is not the fault of the hardware, but rather Windows 10.  Setup was tedious.  After going through multiple rounds of updates taking a couple of hours, I had to do a full reset and start over because the Start Menu would not save any changes.  I would delete the Windows Games and other bloatware I don't need only to have it reappear.  I am not set up on a domain where a Group Policy is doing this, so I decided to reset and that solved the problem.  I also had to do a BIOS update and some Lenovo-dictated driver updates.  After three days of use, all has been good.  Within this price range, I have recently used a Microsoft Surface Laptop and a new Dell XPS 13 and prefer this Lenovo to either of those.
Pc worked well for about 10 months, did a software update and network card got messed up by Lenovo’s own upgrade and they were imposible to reach for support, out of 10 different contact people only 1 was courteous motivated to correct issue, ended up using a local repair center to solve issue.
Very good laptop for everyday work outside(+)good battery life, absolutely love the matte screen!(+)ultra portable(+)very fast(+)best keyboard ever(-) fingerprint scan is terrible(-) cam, speakers(-) the notorious quality check of Lenovo strikes back! mine has an issue with the trackpad which is not working on the left side. Didn't send it back though(-) could be better looking for that amount of money spent
Excellent piece of laptop.Light waight and powerfull with excelent performance.Im glad that I didnt temptate to upgrade to the version with touch screen and higher resolotion since the exsiting capabilities (regular screen with FHD) are more than enough.Its just despointing that in that price its not supplied with the USB-C travel hub (VGA, Ethernet port...)
Love the machine. It is very light weight, has a durable look and feel, though the carbon surface catches dirt marks easily. The battery life is good. The only thing I don’t like about IIt is that battery is fixed inside and you can’t change it or remove it with unscrewing the back cover. I had requested for a Windows 10 pro upgrade which the seller did free of cost!!!
I bought it as a gift, and when we start using it it gets dangerously hot, 80C using only chrome or basic tasks in the office and if I use any heavier software I'm afraid something will happen. It is impossible to use the keyboard because the buttons are very hot, and this happens using it only for 10 minutes. Unfortunately I don't recommend it. When I opened it to see if the fan was working, it’s too small and not enough. And since I am far from the United States, I can't exchange anymore
It is gorgeous! Using DHL as a means of shipment is equivalent to that you need no worry about customs affairs which drove me crazy when I attempted to purchase another item in the United States to the United Kingdom. Even the price is added with customs VAT and international handling fee and is compared with that of United Kingdom, it is still cheap!
I purchased this laptop for our CFO of the company to replace his Lenovo W530.  He wanted speed, but something lighter than his monster W530.  This has been a perfect replacement for him in terms of speed, screen image quality and weight.  No issues with it at all after almost 3 months of use.  Always complements that this is the best laptop he has used.
This is the best laptop I’ve ever had. Extremely light weight and powerful! Battery life is amazing, it lasts all day long. I don’t even bring my charger to the office with me. I just leave it at home. Fingerprint reader is great. My only complaint is that I need a dongle for Ethernet.
This laptop is really suitable for collage student. The best thing about it is the weight. Carrying it is as light and easy as carrying an iPad. I really love it though it is quite expensive. Btw, i5 is good enough and i7 can cost extra money, so choose i5 to save money.
Great experience, delivery on time and product as expected!
Think pads are worth the money!! These are extremely well made, the battery lasts a very long time. Only issue, and I think it's a Windows 10 thing, when you turn it and put it in a carry bag, make sure it's OFF before you close the lid!!!
great one, but the price dropped too quickly
This machine has the nicest keyboard I've ever seen on a portable computer.  Paired it with a portable external monitor for a pretty amazing setup while I'm on the road.
The laptop arrived in perfect condition, works as fast as advertised. Battery life is about 5 hours of heavy use and 24 hours of standby with some music play in background. Highly recommended!
I bought it last year，and I encountered a series problems during the using. Firstly，the wireless didn't work sometimes and it greatly impeded my life and working. Secondly，the picture quality is so terrible as to being worse than my Sony laptop bought 7 years ago. Thirdly，the touchpad often goes malfunction and I couldn't move the cursor. The last but not least，processing is not fluent and will be stuck sometimes. What a disgusting laptop！！！I seriously doubt that it was REFURNISHED.
I use this laptop for work and it hasn't failed me yet. Web development and SEO can easily be done on this laptop.
good solid Lap top good performance long bat life replaced a Surface Pro 4 which had short bat life and had bad usb connections.
Great ecran resolution, super light, long battery life, great microphone and powerful computer. Everything works perfectly since day one.
Very good laptop. I totally recommended.
After going through several xps 13 and x1 carbons (I sell electronics) I replaced my XPS13 9370 8250u laptop with this X1 carbon ultrabook and overall i like this one better.  The xps had brighter screen and better color reproduction, much nicer design, b
Excellent replacement for a computer that had a hard drive die.  Lightweight and fast processing.
Thank you great product
This is the best ultrabook ever made. Incredible looks and performance.
My laptop screen blinks continuously when its connected to wifi network. I have sent it to Lenovo support twice. After the service, it works one month perfect after blinking starts. I don't know  how to solve my problem
The ports had scratches all over them. This is supposed to be new and it looks like it came in used.
I purchased this laptop on May 27th. It abruptly stopped working on August 29th. Apparently the support window ends on August 26th and there is now way to get help with this issue.
I bought this laptop brand new less than two months ago and it will not turn on at all. Not sure what the problem is but tried multiple power cords and reset button - still no joy. This will likely get returned.
Fast and light laptop.
These laptops are definitely not new. Ordered a few for work and two of them crashed within the same hour. This is deceiving.
Had this Computer for 8 months.  Just stopped charging.  Complete waste of money.
These are refurbished units which is not listed in the product description.
I purchased a Lenovo X1 Carbon (i7, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD HD) after having some hardware issues with other work laptops. I needed a high end, limited frills, portable laptop to do heavy duty business work on. And not much else. I don't play games or watch movies on this, I don't do graphics or rendering work. I don't code. Other than work (heavy duty office-suite use, software used through browsers, etc.) all I need this computer for is an occasional youtube video.What I've dealt with since receiving this machine has turned me off from Lenovo forever. The computer itself is as advertised…light, powerful, simple. No touch screen, the keyboard is decent, everything else is great. So far I'd give it a B+.EXCEPT yesterday it started having charging issues after 15 days of use. The computer isn't charging correctly, it's indicating it's connected when it's not, and it's telling me that the power cord I have is the wrong wattage for this computer. Even though it's a) not, and b) been working fine since I got it. And my external monitor flashes on and off. According to the Lenovo client, all of my stuff is up-to-date and working correctly.Enter Lenovo's superior customer support team to fix my issues right away.JUST KIDDING.Enter Lenovo's frustrating but navigate-able menu and (wait for it)….A SALES AND SUPPORT TEAM THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM 9PM EST ON FRIDAY UNTIL 9AM EST ON MONDAY.Can you imagine? A company with an enterprise value north of $13BN, and they won't pay for support on the weekends. Un-freaking-believable.Furthermore, the support staff I talked to (before they locked up the office for the weekend) said that the turn-around time to repair my computer would be 7 business days. Like, no big deal, right? I'll just use pen and paper for a week and a half while my two-week-old computer maybe gets fixed.Or I could talk to sales about getting a new one sent to me, so I can spend a few hours getting my new computer set up and the old one wiped then sent back to you. Oh, but they don't work on the weekends either. (You CAN, however, order a new product by talking to someone through chat on the weekends, but no sales support or technical support.)OR I could take my computer to a certified Lenovo repair site. I live in the SF Bay Area…hardly the middle of nowhere.There is one location within an hour of me.And it's closed on the weekends.There's one more right at an hour from me. I'm not sure if it's open on the weekends. They didn't answer their phone and their website hasn't been updated since 2009.So here I am, wasting my Saturday and NOT spending time with my family because I'm trying to resolve computer issues on a brand new computer with a giant corporation that has 0 resources available to support me on the weekends, as I prepare to get on the road for work tomorrow for a week. Fortunately, I'll be back….late Friday.JUST IN TIME FOR THEM TO CLOSE UP SHOP FOR THE WEEKEND AGAIN.ThinkPad products might be great. I'm not sure. I've heard decent things. But if you end up with a lemon, better start blocking off big chunks of time on your calendar to fix it yourself, because you're going to be left high and dry by Lenovo. Because who really cares about the little guy, right? It's just some shmuck who bought a $2500 laptop computer from an IBM owned company.
After going through several xps 13 and x1 carbons (I sell electronics) I replaced my XPS13 9370 8250u laptop with this X1 carbon ultrabook and overall i like this one better.  The xps had brighter screen and better color reproduction, much nicer design, better battery.The x1 carbon has the same weight as xps 13 which was a decisive point for me,  and as a bonus a bigger and more usable 14" screen. While the trackpad on xps 13 is slightly better (both are great) the keyboard on the x1 is absolutely amazing in comparison to xps 13 which is also good but nowhere near as great.The X1 carbon has a worse thermal solution than the xps 13 and as a result is obnoxiously louder and runs hotter. I solved this issue by repasting the heatsink with noctua nt-h1 paste (i recommend this one, it's easy to spread compared to other paste) After repasting the XPS13 i couldn't hear the fans anymore, but on the X1 carbon they where still on more often than i like.There is a software called ThrottleStop that helped me lower the temperatures down , improve the battery life and make fans silent.  It can be configured to run minimized automatically on windows startup (task scheduler)Before temps where at ~38c Min - 65C maximum. Now they are at 27c Min, 44C max.For reading PDFs and using Office Word on this laptop i turned off turbo boost and undervolted a few option settings. The cpu now consumes as low as 0.1w power and 3.75w max.I wouldn't recommend any ultrabook that has a 4k display or i7 CPU. (i previously had both on xps 13 and carbon x1)While the 4k is very nice to look at, it makes the ultrabook run a lot hotter.  The same goes for the CPU which is also a waste of money in comparison to an i5. If performance is important you shouldn't buy an ultrabook at all.
Bought recently at one of the large wholesale stores with 16GB RAM, Intel i7, and 500 GB SSD. Comes with 2 USB-C / Thunderbolt ports, 2 USB-A ports, and an HDMI port. Typically use wifi at home but bought a Lenovo ethernet adapter (in case I need it for work) and it works great. Setup was very easy even though this was my first experience with Windows 10 (use Windows 7 at my office). This (with 14" screen) replaced my 9 yr old HP EliteBook 8540 with 15.6" screen, and I really don't notice the screen being a little smaller. Keyboard is awesome. This model and its charger are compact, light, and easy to carry. Recommend highly.FYI, I'd probably have gone with the i5 chip and 1 TB SSD, but I got a good deal on this pre-configured model at the large wholesaler.
This seems to be one of the best laptops ever made. I bought two of them.

A decade of laptop design culminates in today's review unit, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10. As the name implies, it is the tenth generation of the X1 Carbon series, . Compared to that first model, a lot of things have changed, but in comparison to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G9, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 is not a huge update.
Lenovo uses the same chassis design for at least two generations. As the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G9 was a huge redesign, the X1 Carbon G10 is a refresh, which keeps the old design intact. It is a chassis that is mature enough for everyday use. A more detailed description of the chassis and its quality can be found in our comprehensive review of the .
There is one relevant design change: Lenovo had to implement a little reverse notch to implement the new webcams. The small protrusion at the center of the screen makes it easier to open the screen. Models with the new webcams, like the reviewed variant, are 0.5 mm thicker than the preceding model.
There are no changes to the ports: the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2022 offers Thunderbolt 4 as well as legacy ports like USB A and HDMI, despite the compact chassis. We do miss an SD card reader with this model.
Compared with the predecessor, the Intel Wireless AX211 (2x2) has been added as a new option, which is also present in our review sample. Different from the AX201, the AX211 supports the new standard WiFi 6E. We did not use it in our test, but the WiFi module is still faster than the AX201 of the X1 Carbon G9.
Normally, there is little to write about when it comes to laptop cameras, but with the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10, the webcam is an important part of the conversation. Lenovo has upped the resolution from 720p to 1080p, and the X1 Carbon G10 also uses an f/2.0 aperture, which should improve low light performance.
The X1 Carbon 2022 offers most of the typical business features, like dTPM 2.0, a Kensington lock slot, or a fingerprint reader. At the same time smartcard reader is not on board, although you will find on regular T/X ThinkPads. New is the Computervision feature for the webcam with "Human Presence Detection". The system recognizes if the user is stepping away from the device, and automatically locks it. This function is optional and can be disabled in the Lenovo Commercial Vantage app.
In the box, there is the 65 W charger with a USB-C plug and no other accessories. Praiseworthy: the box and the outer packaging are completely made out of paper for the first time. Lenovo dispensed the plastics used here before.
There are no changes to the maintenance design of the predecessor. The Carbon fiber bottom cover can be easily removed, only five screws and a few clips at the back of the system have to be loosened. The M.2 2280 SSD is upgradeable, the RAM is soldered. The same is true for the WiFi module. On the other hand, a WWAN card can be slotted in, since our model has the antennas and the SIM slot. But only 4G is possible, as 5G requires additional antennas.
In the tested configuration, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 has three years of warranty, which includes on-site service. In case of a defect, the Lenovo laptop will be repaired at the home or workplace of the customers. This is only true for the country the device was bought in. Internationally, it is a standard depot warranty.
Lenovo uses almost the same keyboard as with the predecessor X1 Carbon G9, but the chiclet keyboard with the backlight and six rows of keys is changed in one aspect: the keys of the first row and the keys on the left and right edge of the keyboard, like Enter, Ctrl or Shift, are now square instead of rounded. The typing feel is not affected, it is purely a visual change. The keyboard is still very comfortable, with 1.5 mm travel, a good layout, and a very satisfying typing experience. That being said, older ThinkPads with more travel are better.
Among the ThinkPads, the X1 models have a special position, as they are the only devices with a glass touchpad - though, this really is not true anymore, as the ThinkPad Z series is being released at the moment and it also has a glass touchpad. The comparison with the Z series is interesting, as the ThinkPad Z13 has a new touchpad design without dedicated TrackPoint buttons. This function is fulfilled by the haptic feedback.
For a refresh like the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10, a possible venue for changes is the screen. This is true here as well, as Lenovo uses the opportunity to introduce new screen options. But in the case of our review device, the 14-inch 16:10 screen we are reviewing was available in the predecessor already:
Ex factory, the colors are slightly too warm, which we measured with CalMan and the X-Rite i1 Pro 2 color spectrophotometer. Calibrated with the X-Rite i1 Profiler, the colors are pretty neutral, with the biggest remaining inaccuracy in the red color space. The ICC profile we created is available for free download.
Due to the matte screen surface, the display is usable outdoors, though the missing nits of the panel used here are noticeable.
ThinkPads are known for having many configurations available. With the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10, Lenovo makes choosing the right model even more complicated, as there are now two different classes of CPUs available: Intel Alder Lake in its U15 and P28 variants, with vPro Enterprise and vPro Essential versions. AMD CPUs are not on the table, and neither are dedicated GPUs.
Lenovo uses the Windows energy settings for power management. For our tests, we are using the mode "best performance" and disabled the Lenovo Intelligent Cooling mode "Auto" (FN + T). This results in a short-term Powerlimit 1 of 55 W and a long-term Powerlimit 2 of 15 W. Our WiFi battery test was performed with the mode "Balanced" (PL1: 20 W / PL2: 11 W).
The  is a processor with four-plus eight asymmetrical cores (4 P + 8 E cores) of the newest generation Intel Alder Lake. As a CPU of the P class, it has a typical TDP of 28 W, though this is just a rough orientation. It is a vPro Enterprise variant of the , which is almost identical to the i5-1250P (clock rates: P cores: 1.7 up to 4.4 GHz, E cores: 1.2 up to 3.3 GHz). Comparisons with other processors are possible with the .
The system performance is good, there are no hiccups in everyday browser usage. Once again though, the benchmarks show that the performance has not substantially improved compared to the predecessor .
For working with audio, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2022 is not suitable, at least not in the reviewed configuration, since it has DPC latency problems. This holds true in the Youtube test as well, as there are dropped frames. Lenovo would have to release a driver update.

The  is the iGPU of all i5 CPUs from the U/P-series for the years 2021 and 2022. Its performance is dependent on the system memory, as the iGPU does not have dedicated memory. In the case of the X1 Carbon G10, it is fast LPDDR5 memory in a quad-channel configuration, which is ideal for the Intel Xe. Despite this, the iGPU does not perform as well as it could, which is probably due to the thermal constraints of the ThinkPad laptop. The Dell Latitude 7420 with the same iGPU performs better in the 3DMark tests.
Gaming after the work is not possible with the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10, apart from older titles. In any case, the quality and resolution have to be lowered.
The Witcher 3 test shows once again that the X1 Carbon 2022 has problems with the cooling. The performance of the iGPU is not stable.
Surprisingly, the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 is a rather quiet system. When idling, the two small fans stay completely quiet. Under load, they reach 35.47 dB(a) - a moderate level for the maximum fan speed. We think Lenovo could have the fans run a little louder to squeeze some more performance out of the CPU.
Despite the quiet fans, the Lenovo laptop X1 Carbon 2022 does not get overly hot. In the stress test and Witcher 3 test, the highest temperatures were measured at the top: 45 degrees Celsius or 113 F above the keyboard. The palmrest stays cool in every case. A bit annoying is the hot keyboard during the Witcher 3 test, but since the ThinkPad is not a gaming laptop, this should not be an issue in everyday use.
The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 has four speakers, two on the bottom and two on top, next to the keyboard. They are sufficiently loud and they do have some bass, but there is still a lot of room for improvement.
The power consumption of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 is good, the competitors from last year consume more energy. The X1 Carbon G9 consumes less only for the maximum idle consumption.
For the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10, the platform upgrade to Intel Alder Lake is the main focus. In the case of the reviewed unit, it is Alder Lake P28. All things considered, we can say: the new generation fails to meet our expectations.
The tested model costs roughly $2,030 when configured in the Lenovo online store. The base price for the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 in the USA sits at $1,560 as of writing this review.

"considering its low profile design so on"
"the left hand side you get a few"
"thunderbolt 4 ports a usb type a 3.2 gen"
"1 port an hdmi 2.0 port switching over"
"to the right hand side there's"
"kensington lock another usb type a 3.2"
"gen 1 port and a headphone jack i'm"
"actually a little disappointed that they"
"didn't include usb 3.2 gen 2 ports"
"because they have twice the bandwidth"
"compared to gen 1. um it could be a"
"design limitation but it's still weird"
"to see on laptop that costs"
"so much money moving on to the display"
"and one of the biggest upgrades from gen"
"8 to gen 9 is the inclusion of a 16 by"
"10 screen which gives you more vertical"
"screen real estate so you can have more"
"content filling up your screen i have"
"the uhd plus 60hz non-touch variant and"
"it is an excellent panel with beautiful"
"color reproduction it's an ips panel and"
"it covers 100 srgb 91 adobe rgb and 99"
"dcip3 that's oled level guys which is"
"amazing and on top of that it gets super"
"bright our sample goes as far as 514"
"hits so whether if you're a professional"
"photographer or just someone who works"
"on presentations for your company"
"you're seriously in for a treat my only"
"issue though is it's a glossy finish and"
"lenovo hasn't added any anti-reflective"
"coating to cut down the reflections plus"
"this panel doesn't have the privacy"
"guard feature that disables the view"
"angle from both left and right to"
"protect the content on the screen you"
"only get that feature with the"
"1200pm matte display option which is 500"
"nits so just keep that in mind"
"but also another thing to note is that"
"those panels take a slight hit on the"
"color gamut so what i'm going to do"
"right now is let mike chime in with his"
"thoughts on the new x1 carbon so take it"
"away man all right guys eber asked me to"
"jump in front of the camera here because"
"i am a die hard thinkpad user i've been"
"using actually this little guy right"
"over here the thinkpad x1 carbon 6 gen"
"for the last three years and it's been"
"through hell it's been through"
"rainstorms in taiwan it's been lost in"
"vegas it's basically been through"
"everything but it's still going and i"
"absolutely love it but like a lot of"
"thinkpad users i don't want there to be"
"any changes"
"to the thinkpad unless it's absolutely"
"necessary so what are my thoughts about"
"this x1 carbon and i've been using this"
"for about a week for the most part the"
"changes that have been made"
"intergenerationally they've been for the"
"better for example that 16x10 screen"
"that they're now using from a"
"productivity standpoint it's a huge"
"upgrade now the funny thing for me is"
"that"
"going to that 16x10 screen i didn't"
"actually realize what i was getting but"
"when i stepped back to my old thinkpad"
"that's what i realized what i was losing"
"on the other hand i really have to"
"appreciate the fact that they've"
"upgraded the finish on it mine you can"
"see the fingerprints and the shmu on"
"there from a mile and a half away the"
"new one it still gets marked up quite a"
"bit but at the same time it doesn't show"
"quite as much of the junk as the older"
"one the other thing that they really did"
"upgrade or what i think is a downgrade"
"is the keyboard that thinkpad keyboard"
"has always been legendary"
"mine i love the throw distance i love"
"the fact that there's a little bit of"
"tactile feedback it just feels right"
"the new one it's really hard to describe"
"this and i'm going to struggle with"
"words here a little bit but it almost"
"feels like they pulled a little bit of"
"the life out of that older thinkpad"
"keyboard in order to make it maybe a"
"little bit more low profile in order to"
"fit upgraded components inside other"
"than that the port selection is the same"
"so you don't need to go to dongle life"
"like you do with the xps 13 for example"
"lenovo kept all of the ports that were"
"there and upgraded the ones that needed"
"to be upgraded the last thing i wanted"
"to mention is the webcam because"
"something that i noticed again and again"
"and again over the conference calls that"
"i had in the last week or so so let's"
"get to that well guys this is the webcam"
"test on the sixth generation x1 carbon"
"and as you can see it's a three-year-old"
"laptop webcam there's looks like there's"
"vaseline smeared over my face there's a"
"lot of noise going around and auto"
"exposure even though auto exposure is"
"off it looks like it's still on by all"
"of this flickering going on in the"
"screen now i'm going to switch over to"
"the new x1 carbon to really really hope"
"that it looks a lot better than this one"
"and welcome to the ninth generation"
"thinkpad x1 carbon and what can i say"
"oh my god i in some ways it has actually"
"gotten worse than three years ago so"
"first of all there's this odd sharpening"
"going on and yes i don't look like i was"
"smeared with vaseline except now i look"
"like i have craters all over my face or"
"something not only that is that the"
"colors are so subdued it to me it really"
"really doesn't look good even looking at"
"in this screen right now it almost looks"
"black and white i'm wondering if the"
"actual recording is going to be like"
"that other than that i mean luckily auto"
"exposure turns itself off completely now"
"so you can really balance that one way"
"or another but otherwise"
"i really want to know what you guys"
"think about this to me"
"it's a disappointment there's a"
"professional device and yes you're going"
"to be seen on on zoom calls so a little"
"little talking head down there but"
"how is it looking like this and"
"what i've done here is i've gone through"
"the settings to do the best possible"
"capture and this is it guys"
"what do you think so"
"yeah that webcam test didn't go as well"
"as we thought it would but hey on the"
"positive side they've implemented dual"
"front-facing speakers with this"
"generation and it sounds amazing there"
"is good clarity in the high end and the"
"bass response is respectable to be"
"honest i didn't expect this from a"
"thinkpad but"
"i'm going to take it anyway guys"
"upgradability is pretty limited on the"
"x1 carbon the memory is soldered onto"
"the pcb and the primary nvme ssd is"
"right over here and the drive speeds are"
"really fast specifically with reads"
"however the right performance is average"
"there is a wlan slot which adopts the"
"m.2 interface but it's strictly meant"
"for networking cards i tried to install"
"my toshiba rc100 ssd but the bios"
"refused it"
"now i'm aware that some gen 6 laptops"
"can take secondary drives but with the"
"gen 9"
"i'm not really sure guys but anyways"
"let's talk about battery life because"
"this thing has a 4k screen which to be"
"honest is pointless in a 14-inch form"
"factor but we were just interested to"
"see how it stacks up with the other thin"
"and laptops that we've tested"
"and"
"well first of all if you want the best"
"battery life absolutely avoid the 4k"
"screen and maybe even think about"
"grabbing the i5 instead of the i7 our"
"sample has"
"but even with those two things working"
"against it the x1 carbon actually gets"
"some reasonable numbers at almost 13"
"hours in the light load test remember"
"that other than the dell xps 13 all the"
"other competitors here have either"
"smaller screens or lower resolutions so"
"with that in mind this is actually"
"pretty impressive and it makes me wonder"
"if the 1200p model would come closer to"
"these zenbook numbers under a heavier"
"load well there's nothing to complain"
"about here either with the x1 posting"
"the longest battery life of any thin and"
"light tiger lake laptop we've seen so"
"far i mean look this class of thingpad"
"isn't meant for running multi-core loads"
"while being unplugged but if you need to"
"well at least you won't have to find an"
"outlet every hour but this all leads to"
"something pretty interesting about this"
"laptop and that's its performance mode"
"you see lenovo has always targeted the"
"carbon series at professionals who just"
"want to plug in their laptop and start"
"using it day in and day out with minimum"
"amount of fuss so that means no fiddling"
"around with settings or bloatware and"
"most of all"
"nothing that takes away from"
"productivity time anyways that led them"
"to create a really straightforward power"
"plan where the modes are switched"
"through the standard windows power"
"manager in your taskbar there are two"
"auto modes that allow the system to"
"manage surface temperatures cpu speeds"
"and noise while favoring either a"
"balanced approach or"
"a more performance area there's also a"
"manual performance mode that simply"
"allows the processor to run at higher"
"speeds for longer periods of time you"
"can actually see this quite well with"
"both performance and auto performance"
"delivering really similar power input"
"right up until the four-minute mark of"
"our test"
"then the algorithm lenovo uses in auto"
"mode dials things back to between 12 and"
"15 watts until surface temperatures are"
"reduced and then it kicks things up"
"again"
"meanwhile performance mode simply runs"
"at 23 watts all day"
"auto balance on the other hand"
"well i'm not sure if you want to be"
"running this for any intensive tasks"
"since it limits the processor to just 7"
"watts that's perfect for most the folks"
"who are looking at the x1 but it's"
"terrible for anything other than a light"
"workload you can actually see what"
"happens with clock speeds when those"
"three modes are being used balanced"
"barely sticks above one gigahertz while"
"the other two performance modes offer"
"more than double the amount of speed and"
"honestly if you're in a pension trying"
"to render out a file or get a bit of"
"extra transcoding work done ditching out"
"the out-of-the-box balance mode is the"
"only thing to do that all translates"
"into auto performance and performance"
"hitting just above 95 degrees for"
"shorter amounts of time before the fans"
"pick up a bit of steam and draws things"
"down to a lot more reasonable levels"
"but you can still see how the automatic"
"setting gets quite aggressive for a few"
"minutes before letting its foot off the"
"gas and it lets temperatures spike again"
"it does that over and over again when"
"you look at balance well it's what you"
"probably expected it's cool and really"
"well behaved right across the board"
"barely reaching above 50 degrees"
"but good news about all of this is"
"regardless of whatever mode you're in"
"the thinkpad x1 carbon is one of the"
"quietest machines out here for the"
"professionals and even students who buy"
"these things that's pretty important"
"since the last thing anyone wants is for"
"a meeting to be interrupted by a loud"
"laptop and even when running at full"
"tilt surface temperatures are well"
"managed which means working with it on"
"your lap in the airport or in a"
"classroom setting shouldn't really pose"
"any problems there is a small hotspot on"
"the back but it's focused in an area"
"that doesn't usually come in contact"
"with your body now moving on to real"
"world benchmarks in the auto performance"
"mode and the results here are pretty"
"much in line with what we've come to"
"expect from the i7 1165 g7 in a thin and"
"light laptop it'll lose to the amd cpus"
"and multi-threaded benchmarks since they"
"have double the number of processing"
"threads"
"one of the other challenges here is auto"
"performance mode doesn't run at a"
"constant speed so the results tend to"
"vary a lot but at the same time it gives"
"excellent performance in areas where the"
"x1 carbon is likely going to be used"
"most of the time and that's likely"
"thread situations like word processing"
"spreadsheets exports and pdf creation"
"the premiere results need a bit of an"
"explanation here because they're almost"
"too good to be true basically what's"
"happening here is lenovo's doing app"
"detection in the auto performance mode"
"we're using so in this situation the xe"
"graphics gets a bit more juice and"
"operates at about 225 megahertz since"
"premiere is gpu bound that little extra"
"bit of performance makes a big"
"difference in longer renders like this"
"one now taking a look at gaming"
"performance"
"this is obviously not something that"
"people find themselves using the x1 for"
"but still i know for a fact that when we"
"used to travel to shows"
"mike played civ on his carbon during"
"longer flights i mean it's a great way"
"to pass time and with the iris xc"
"graphics this generation is actually"
"able to play most basic titles at some"
"pretty decent frame rates unless you get"
"into one of those situations where"
"intel's drivers end up crashing most of"
"the time i've got to say this is one"
"area where amd really needs to step"
"things up because their vega"
"architecture is really really starting"
"to show its age on the laptop side of"
"things so final thoughts on the x1"
"carbon gen 9 from lenovo and guys i'm"
"seriously impressed with this laptop the"
"first thing that comes to my mind is"
"just how lightweight it is while being"
"extremely durable the 16x10 screen is"
"gorgeous and it's really bright um the"
"keyboard is still best in class battery"
"life is also pretty good but i would"
"honestly pick up the 1200p option if you"
"want to get a little bit more life out"
"of this thing"
"the performance is also quite nice as"
"well and most importantly it's one of"
"the quietest laptops that we've tested"
"under heavier load situations now if you"
"look at the price situation it is"
"expensive but what you're really paying"
"for is something that's going to last"
"you for years to come ahead"
"and"
"you also get the enhanced security"
"features like a privacy switch an ir"
"camera lenovo self healing bios a dtpm"
"chip that encrypts user data"
"now with the average consumer care about"
"those things"
"probably not in fact it's really geared"
"towards professionals or people who work"
"in the corporate side where they deal"
"with classified information"
"and i think most likely you might just"
"end up getting one of these through work"
"instead of paying out of your own pocket"
"personally i would pick this over the"
"xps 13 just because it got it's got more"
"ports and"
"it's matte black which is my vibe and oh"
"if you do find it on sale"
"and if it fits your budget i would"
"definitely pick this up without even"
"thinking for a second so"
"on that note"
"thank you so much for watching i hope"
"you were able to take away everything"
"that you needed to know about the x1"
"carbon from lenovo let me know what you"
"guys think about this little thing"
"because"
"um"
"this is my first thinkpad laptop in a"
"while um and i'm seriously impressed"
"i kind of wish i"
"i think i might switch from the xps 13"
"but i have to send this back so"
"yeah"
"anyways"
"that's for me guys"
"oh and don't forget to spend responsibly"
"Introducing Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10."
"With its enhanced, air-intake keyboard and 110 mm glass touchpad, 2.8k OLED and WQUXGA Touch display options."
"The X1 Carbon has the new Intel 12 gen U15/P28 CPUs with 20W design and 32GB of memory – this is where beauty meets performance."
"And with 5G and Wifi 6E the X1 Carbon has the industry’s best connectivity."
"The X1 Carbon also comes with new FHD cameras, housed in a communications bar with optional computer vision."
"The improved camera experience, combined with Dolby Voice and eyesafe certified low blue light displays, gives hybrid work a whole new elevated experience."
"so this is the lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon"
"9th gen very long name but a very"
"popular laptop in the business world and"
"i was going to straight up review this"
"by itself but i reviewed the x1 nano"
"about a week ago and this compared to"
"that"
"it makes a lot of sense like these two"
"laptops are so similar in a ton of ways"
"they both have that thinkpad look and"
"feel and the price is different one is"
"700 cheaper than the other so you might"
"be asking yourself if you need to pay"
"extra or not by the end of this video"
"if you look at them you can see the same"
"kind of design philosophy they're both"
"mil std tested they can withstand spills"
"on the keyboard"
"they're they're really light 2.15 pounds"
"for the nano compared to 2.49"
"on the carbon if you're holding them you"
"can feel the difference but quite"
"frankly 2.49 pounds is so light to begin"
"with that i think most people won't"
"complain about the weight but the nano"
"is meant for for hardcore travel"
"warriors right you're trying to pack as"
"light as possible and that's what the"
"nano is for because even though it's"
"lighter it's just a smaller laptop like"
"when you put it on top of the carbon you"
"can see that the laptop is not as deep"
"and not as wide now this is the black"
"model but you can also get the nano with"
"a weave and the black model tends to"
"show fingerprints a lot easier compared"
"to the weave which shows it too but it's"
"not as drastic now the one thing you're"
"giving up with the nano is ports you"
"only get two thunderbolt 4 ports on the"
"left-hand side so for some of you out"
"there that might mean carrying dongles"
"with you the carbon on the other hand"
"has all the ports you can think of two"
"thunderbolt 4 you have your usb port"
"full-size hdmi and then when you flip it"
"to the other side you have another usb"
"port and your headphone jack the other"
"big difference is the keyboard deck"
"there's just a lot more space to work"
"with on the carbon the nano is just a"
"little bit more cramped due to its"
"smaller form factor the typing"
"experience is identical i didn't find"
"typing on one easier over the other but"
"the touch pad is the main difference"
"like you just get a lot more space to"
"move your fingers around on the carbon"
"but here's the funny thing even though"
"you get more space on the carbon i found"
"the touchpad on the nano to be a lot"
"more enjoyable to use one thing i found"
"about lenovo thinkpads in general is"
"that the consistency of the touchpads"
"vary from unit to unit it's never"
"exactly the same some just happen to be"
"a bit better is it a big deal is it"
"drastic is it going to ruin the way you"
"use your laptop absolutely not just"
"something i noticed after years and"
"years of reviewing think pads the other"
"thing is the fingerprint scanner this is"
"right beside the touch pad on the nano"
"whereas on the carbon it's embedded into"
"the power button speakers are both on"
"top of the deck but you have more"
"speakers with the carbon and therefore"
"you do get better sound just because"
"there's more room to work with"
"[Applause]"
"[Music]"
"[Applause]"
"now both of these laptops can have your"
"screen flipped 180 degrees they both"
"support windows hello and they both have"
"720p webcams the webcams are nothing"
"special but they're there the other"
"thing to note is lenovo's smart presence"
"technology so when you approach any of"
"these laptops it detects that you're"
"there and then scans your face and logs"
"you in the moment you go away from the"
"laptop it will detect that you left and"
"automatically lock your screen in case"
"you forgot to"
"the displays are a bit different they're"
"they're both 16 by 10. the difference is"
"that this one happens to be 14 inches"
"and this is 13. quite frankly i feel"
"like i'm working on a bigger display"
"than a 13 inch display because of that"
"aspect ratio and same holds true for the"
"bigger carbon the difference in color"
"accuracy really comes down to the skew"
"that you decide to buy like this one you"
"can buy it with a 1900 or 1920x1200"
"display but this one happens to be 4k"
"and you're just getting a lot more"
"brightness more color gamut to work with"
"if you're really into design this"
"doesn't have such a crazy color gamut"
"compared to the carbon but it's still"
"really good and the fact that this one's"
"matte gives you less reflection if"
"you're outdoors a lot now they did a"
"pretty good job of reducing the"
"reflection on this glossy display and"
"it's significantly less than let's say"
"the surface laptop but again because you"
"have a glossy display there's going to"
"be a bit of reflection now both of these"
"laptops are using an i7 processor and"
"they're both 11th gen but there is a"
"difference one is using a 116 zero g7"
"and the other is a one one six five g"
"seven thank you intel for making this"
"very confusing what the zero g7 means is"
"that the x1 nano is using a lower tdp of"
"that i7 processor this one is like a 15"
"watt processor whereas this one can go"
"up to 30 watts which means the carbon is"
"technically going to give you better"
"performance the funny thing though is"
"all the tests i ran the carbon did"
"perform better but it wasn't like"
"drastic you know like take this mozilla"
"compile time yes it compiled faster on"
"the carbon but it wasn't by much"
"if you're an editor or a designer and"
"you're buying these for photoshop and"
"you're doing meetings and stuff like"
"that again the carbon is going to be the"
"better option but it's not drastic and"
"if you're a video editor looking for"
"something light and portable these are"
"not it you usually want something with a"
"dedicated gpu but the beauty of using an"
"intel laptop with that iris xe graphics"
"chip and quick sync if you're using"
"adobe premiere pro you can still edit a"
"video like you can still"
"do it i just don't recommend doing it"
"all the time and again it's going to be"
"faster on the carbon the other thing to"
"note is that these things"
"can be pushed harder but lenovo aiming"
"these laptops towards business users"
"want to make sure the fan noise is low"
"that's why when these things are under"
"full load you can hear the fans but"
"they're not loud around like 43 decibels"
"heat management is also going to be good"
"because the fan noise needs to stay low"
"so they're going to power limit the cpu"
"so that the the heat doesn't get too hot"
"and the fans don't get too loud"
"internally the only thing that is"
"upgradable is the nvme ssd the ram is"
"completely soldered onto the motherboard"
"the other difference is the fan layout"
"you get one big fan with the nano which"
"makes sense considering this is a 15"
"watt"
"cpu you don't really need two for it and"
"on the carbon you have two fans since it"
"has a higher tdp the other thing to note"
"is the drive setup this is using a 2280"
"nvme ssd and nets you've higher read and"
"write speeds the smaller nvme ssd inside"
"of here is still fast but not as fast as"
"the carbon the battery is bigger in the"
"carbon 57 watt hours compared to 47 but"
"here's the thing i actually got better"
"battery life on the x1 nano probably"
"most likely due to the fact that this is"
"not using a 4k display and this is a 13"
"inch display instead of 14 inches so"
"here's the thing on paper the carbon 9th"
"gen makes more sense you're getting a"
"slightly faster computer you're getting"
"more ports to work with you're getting a"
"better sound you're getting a bigger"
"keyboard deck a much bigger touchpad to"
"work with and you're getting the option"
"of a bigger display but it costs"
"anywhere from five to seven hundred"
"dollars more if you go with the 4k model"
"over the x1 nano and if the performance"
"was significantly better then i would"
"say it might be worth it but the"
"performance difference between both of"
"these guys are not that drastic and the"
"x1 nano is already getting you 90 to 95"
"percent there i didn't find like i was"
"missing much when i was using the x1"
"nano like i didn't find like i needed to"
"go back to the carbon and if you're an"
"i.t administrator who's going from"
"office or to office or will be in the"
"near future"
"then i think you're going to have a lot"
"more fun with the nano because most"
"people buying these business laptops"
"they're not like doing 3d work and"
"compiling code for 10 hours straight"
"they're using excel they're writing"
"documents they're remoting into their"
"company's infrastructure to manage it"
"and i think with the better battery life"
"on the nano you might find this to be"
"the better option now if you're"
"interested in picking any of these guys"
"up there'll be links to it in the"
"description down below if you have any"
"more questions let me know like the"
"video if you liked it subscribe if you"
"haven't already and i'll see you guys in"
"the next one"
"This is the coolest laptop I've ever used."
"Sadly, it's also one of the most disappointing."
"(upbeat music)"
"Let's review."
"The last time you saw the Lenovo X1 Fold on this channel,"
"I used it to explore all the ways a folding screen"
"changed the way I used a laptop."
"Now that term, laptop, is important because"
"some folks have called this a tablet,"
"and sure, it can be used that way."
"But at 2.2 pounds, it's really too clunky for that label."
"Where this machine finds full expression"
"is when you treat it like a PC."
"With a built in kickstand, it deploys to a 13.3 inch"
"easel with detached keyboard on a desktop,"
"collapses to a kind of cyber throwback Netbook for travel,"
"and finally, folds into the footprint of a hardback novel"
"when you need to pack it away."
"Now because of that novel nature of folding screens,"
"you might think that the problems I'd found"
"arise from that flexibility."
"But not at all."
"In fact, Lenovo's hardware is frankly inspired."
"In the almost two year run up to its release,"
"the company was incredibly open to sharing"
"how much work went into building a machine"
"that earns its Thinkpad name."
"That's the company's business brand of laptops,"
"generally held to a higher standard of reliability"
"because they're aimed at the enterprise."
"One of my favorite things from CES 2020"
"was Lenovo having brought an exploded model"
"of the X1 Fold for the press to poke and prod,"
"which we certainly did."
"I've twisted the hinges, I've stabbed the screen"
"and by now I've used the assembled device"
"on and off for about two months."
"I wasn't sure anyone could realize the dream"
"of a folding screen PC solid enough to stand up"
"to everyday use, but the X1 Fold does it."
"The leather back evokes the premium feel"
"of an old journal, while the stacked Netbook mode"
"means you can still work under cramped conditions."
"And over the two months I've used it,"
"there's been none of the loosening or creaking"
"or creasing you might expect."
"The only hardware quibbles I do have are the"
"Chassis being a little more reluctant to fold fully flat,"
"resulting in a very slight angle when open,"
"and an oil slick-like reflectivity of the screen"
"under certain lighting when powered off."
"Incidentally I've seen both of those characteristics"
"on the Motorola Razor as well,"
"so maybe these are just typical attributes of"
"whatever flexible screen LG display provided here."
"Those characteristics don't materially affect"
"everyday use."
"I'm more annoyed by the thin, tinny speakers"
"than I am anything to do with the folding screen."
"But while the foldable form factor may not be"
"the root of the machine's problems,"
"those problems do start with a byproduct"
"of its foldable nature."
"See, in order to offer full functionality"
"and its various postures,"
"the X1 Fold needs a detachable keyboard."
"On paper, it's quite clever."
"Has a Bluetooth keyboard, it works whether"
"it's attached or not."
"When it does attach, it does so magnetically"
"and it even charges while it's on there,"
"fitting perfectly inside the gap between"
"the screens' halves."
"I even got used to the compromises that were made"
"in the name of miniaturization."
"The enter key that I hit instead of the"
"apostrophe a hundred times,"
"the fact that typing a question mark means holding down"
"not just the function key, but the function"
"and the shift keys."
"But I never got used to every 30th word"
"sprouting extra letters."
"A problem that, to be fair, I've experienced on"
"other Bluetooth keyboards going all the way back"
"to the Pixel C."
"Look at this, every double letter you see here is genuine."
"I didn't force any errors for effect."
"It's not a problem with the keyboard itself,"
"since the doubling kept right on happening"
"even when I paired this thing with the"
"quirky writer I keep around for when I want"
"no one to take me seriously at the coffee shop."
"And I did have better luck when I stuck to netbook mode"
"with the keyboard resting right on the device."
"But that bundled keyboard has other problems."
"A terrible tiny track pad that's finicky"
"and prone to cursor drift."
"There are no rubber feet on the keyboard"
"so it wanders all over the place if you type on"
"a slippery table top."
"Whatever material the keys are made of,"
"it's so soft that it starts showing wear"
"after just two days of use."
"And to top it all off, there's no back light,"
"so if you're trying to type in a darkened plane"
"or train cabin, good luck with that."
"When I put all these problems to Lenovo,"
"the company sent me a replacement for the retail device"
"I had purchased, which I really appreciated."
"Sadly though, that swap didn't fix any of my problems"
"and in fact, it brought to light a whole new set of them."
"When I tried resetting the first machine,"
"that reset failed, and without a physical keyboard"
"I couldn't resolve the issue."
"Then a few weeks after I first set it up,"
"I powered up the replacement X1 Fold"
"to find that it had forgotten the date and time."
"Now, I was able to fix that in the bios,"
"but then the device put itself into what looked like"
"some kind of update loop which lasted until"
"the battery ran out."
"Only after an overnight charge and an automated"
"Windows repair did it start working again, kinda."
"Now if you're thinking, hey, you know,"
"this just doesn't seem like a device that's a great match"
"for Windows 10, you know I think you're onto something."
"This isn't a secret."
"From the very first time I saw the X1 Fold Prototype,"
"it was clear that it was not built for any version"
"of Windows that we had yet seen."
"The Windows 10 operating system is not planned"
"for the final product."
"But rather for the sleeker, Chrome OS competitor"
"that came to be called Windows 10X."
"10X was intended to serve as the launch platform"
"for Microsoft's new Surface Neo device,"
"but when 10X got delayed, the Neo did too."
"Not so for Lenovo."
"The X1 Fold launched almost on time at the tail end of 2020"
"with Windows 10 Home and Pro, instead of X as options."
"And the result, well, (buzzer)"
"That's what happens when the Spotify web player"
"and X1 Fold decide to disagree about whether or not"
"the device should go to sleep."
"And that's just the start of it."
"A few times a week I'll wake up the machine"
"to find that it thinks it's in landscape or portrait mode"
"when it's really just the opposite."
"That's part of why Lenovo made its own mode switcher"
"to help you switch orientations,"
"but it doesn't always work,"
"so you need to restart sometimes to get it oriented right."
"At one point while ""wroting this revie the lay board"
"just stopped wrpling because Bluetooth stopped wrpling."""
"Which meant I had to switch over to the built-in"
"Windows software lay board and its inconsistent autocorrect."
"The other limitations aren't really bugs,"
"so much as symptoms of a system design that's"
"very specific."
"While it's responsive enough for typical browsing"
"and office tasks, this Lakefield Core i5 cpu"
"doesn't pack any of the newer niceties"
"Intel included with its Evo line."
"Like the rapid wakeup and better battery management"
"I talked about on my Asus Zenbook Duo 14 review."
"That platform or maybe even Qualcomm's"
"Always Connected PC Snapdragon would've been"
"a perfect fit for a device like this."
"As it stands now, the X1 Fold is often slow to wake,"
"and if I'm using it in easel mode with the full screen,"
"I generally get fewer than four hours of constant use"
"on a full charge."
"Judging from other reviews battery tests,"
"it seems I would get better endurance"
"if I didn't have to run the screen at max brightness"
"almost all the time."
"But it's top line output of 300 nits just isn't"
"bright enough for a machine that's supposed to come with me"
"everywhere I go."
"And I want to take the X1 Fold everywhere I go."
"I was the kid who watched way too much Inspector Gadget"
"and ruins scores of library books by sketching"
"Penny's computer book into their back pages."
"So I've been waiting for that computer book for 30 years."
"Today, I like to think of myself as"
"YouTube's biggest champion of folding screen technology."
"And seeing a panel this crisp and durable,"
"one you can even use a pen on without damaging it,"
"it's otherworldly."
"I know I glossed over tablet mode,"
"but if you're an artist or a designer with a good use"
"for this Wacom enabled stylus, this would be next level."
"Factor in the revival of cyber punks style"
"that makes this kinda retro look cool again,"
"this thing could be incredible."
"Unfortunately for a starting price this high"
"and a bug list this long,"
"the only thing incredible about it is how badly it's been"
"hobbled by shipping with a half baked"
"and badly implemented form of the wrong OS."
"Man, I'm sorry, but you can max out a"
"Microsoft Surface Go 2, toss in a keyboard mouse and a pen"
"and still save a thousand dollars."
"If it ever gets a build of Windows 10X,"
"I'll be first in line to reevaluate,"
"but until then, I can't recommend it."
"And given the caliber of this hardware"
"and the potential of the concept,"
"that's something I'm genuinely sad to say."
"If you wanna learn more about Windows 10x,"
"check out the excellent reporting by comrades"
"at Windows Central."
"Link below alongside some other reviews of the X1 Fold"
"I think you'll find helpful."
"This review is produced following 60 days"
"with a retail X1 Fold purchased by Mr. Mobile"
"and a review sample sent by Lenovo."
"As always, and obviously in this case,"
"Lenovo didn't pay for this coverage."
"The opinions herein are mine and mine alone."
"Until next time, thanks for watching."
"And if you can't stay home, remember to stay safe"
"and mask up while you stay mobile, my friends."
"ed here with the digital digest and"
"today i wanted to share a quick unboxing"
"and first look at the lenovo thinkpad x1"
"carbon gen 10. now this just arrived"
"from lenovo for review purposes it"
"starts at roughly 1400 us dollars and"
"change i'll include a link in the"
"description and believe it or not some"
"units are already shipping out so let's"
"get this out of the box i'll talk about"
"what's new uh for 20 2022 with the"
"gen 10 version"
"most importantly we now have uh brand"
"new of course intel 12th gen processors"
"uh in this build we've got"
"the"
"1260p that is a core i7"
"which should give i would say really"
"improved overall"
"processor performance from the previous"
"generation"
"that's one of the big differences this"
"year and then in addition to that"
"we've also got lpddr5 ram"
"which is soldered to the board so keep"
"that in mind when you're looking at"
"different"
"pre-configurations of this machine"
"make sure that you get the ram"
"amount that you actually need"
"and beyond that it looks like"
"we've got a little bit of paperwork in"
"here that i'm grabbing"
"everything seems to be recycled"
"packaging which"
"nothing wrong with that that's a good"
"thing and yeah all your paperwork"
"now"
"we do have of course facial recognition"
"for those of you that are wondering for"
"windows hello"
"security purposes but let's get to the"
"laptop itself two and a half pounds and"
"that's part of the beauty of what"
"really is promised to be an incredibly"
"uh lightweight durable ultra book that"
"has basically a little bit of everything"
"including touch screen"
"now"
"new for 2022"
"besides that"
"brand new processor"
"and of course the ddr5 ram remember"
"soldered to the board"
"we also have a full hd webcam so that's"
"an upgrade a little bit it seems of"
"design changes nothing too crazy"
"we have also in addition to that a gen 4"
"nvme ssd drive"
"for those of you that are wondering"
"that is yet another uh nice addition"
"they've also reconfigured cooling uh"
"this is a 65 watt charger no surprise"
"there"
"so"
"i think this is going to be a popular"
"machine granted i haven't even powered"
"it on i mean"
"from an aesthetic standpoint it's really"
"nice matte display again 14 inches"
"we do have a privacy switch on that full"
"hd webcam uh fingerprint scanner right"
"here i like that the display is matte"
"i'm powering this up"
"but as it does boot hdmi"
"2.0 i think it's a b"
"of course usb type a i think this is a"
"3.2 gen 1. and then we have two"
"thunderbolt 4 ports which is great of"
"course that's how you're going to also"
"charge the machine you can see it's"
"booting up right now on the other side"
"headphone uh combo jack and then of"
"course that"
"yet another"
"still important uh usb type a port and a"
"kensington lock"
"build quality on this"
"is excellent just as it was with the"
"previous generation it's going to be"
"really difficult to"
"i think beat the overall aesthetic the"
"whole package the cpu"
"and"
"again overall performance that will"
"likely"
"not yield amazing battery life but let's"
"see you know if this gets between 8 and"
"10 hours i don't think that that's bad"
"the oled display option uh besides the"
"cpu itself i think is one of the most"
"important new elements to this machine"
"now this is a 16 by 10 aspect ratio ips"
"panel"
"but"
"and again full hd plus that means"
"by 1200 res but you can spec this out"
"with a 2.2 k oled option this does"
"promise"
"very good color fidelity and from what i"
"can see right now it looks really good"
"but the question will be"
"you know how does that oled perform in"
"all likelihood it's going to be"
"excellent"
"so that's something to be aware of and"
"of course this does carry intel evo"
"certification um"
"the processor is"
"i believe that it's a v pro certified so"
"i just you know a lot of nice things"
"going on here your classic"
"thinkpad keyboard"
"you've got the nub in the event you need"
"it you've got of course"
"a standard i would say pretty much"
"standard thinkpad"
"trackpad and then you still have of"
"course the good old left and right click"
"for when you're using the nub or even"
"for those of you who just don't want to"
"use the trackpad to actually make"
"selections you've got flexibility now"
"you can also"
"get 5g or 4g radios on this so that's"
"another thing when customization comes"
"down to it but just remember you're"
"going to want to flex this thing on ram"
"because of it being soldered the nvme"
"drive you can upgrade yourself uh for"
"those of you that are wondering i"
"believe this came with a one terabyte"
"again gen 4 drive but i'll be testing it"
"out putting it through the paces let's"
"just go ahead and jump on the internet"
"for a second"
"and just see what that's like"
"and"
"you know having touchscreen on something"
"this size and"
"uh the fact that it does go 180 degrees"
"this is going to be a popular machine"
"just like the previous generation"
"especially now with that more powerful"
"processor can they ever get it to be"
"more efficient i don't know but it's"
"definitely more powerful anyone who"
"tells you otherwise well"
"they haven't played with the 1260p so"
"getting onto wi-fi here as i said let's"
"do that"
"jumping on right now i also like all of"
"the keys that we have"
"the dedicated keys at the top always a"
"nice touch not everybody loves it but i"
"am a fan"
"and"
"i think it's the whole balance of all"
"the parts here that makes this such an"
"attractive machine because it has a"
"great keyboard it has a good trackpad"
"has a really nice display especially now"
"with that oled option you've got the"
"upgraded webcam faster now lp ddr5 ram"
"faster nvme uh gen 4 drive so it pretty"
"much i think checks all the boxes for"
"what you would want out of an ultrabook"
"especially if like me you really have"
"been waiting for that oled option so"
"we're just gonna"
"open it up here and let's just see"
"we're gonna start without data"
"so let's go ahead and move forward"
"and"
"you know they just took over the world"
"but"
"just to jump to a site quickly"
"um i will take you over to youtube and"
"let's just take a look at a little bit"
"of what the video performance is like on"
"this display which i believe tops out at"
"roughly 400 nits of brightness"
"we'll go ahead and take a little 4k hdr"
"sample clip"
"and let's just this is always a good"
"benchmark"
"especially since it's designed for oled"
"and you're hearing the speakers too"
"win-win"
"[Music]"
"brightness let's talk about that"
"we're at full brightness right now"
"speakers are right here if that wasn't"
"already obvious on the side of the deck"
"and"
"my mistake there let's get audio all the"
"way up"
"so i think it looks really good it"
"sounds good and then this thing weighs"
"two and a half pounds has a solid"
"processor"
"again it pretty much checks every box"
"especially if you're like me and you"
"still want to have touch screen and the"
"fact that it's matte not high reflective"
"is a godsend now in terms of other"
"things wi-fi 6e that's another upgrade"
"over the previous generation i didn't"
"mention before that is soldered to the"
"board"
"uh but no worries i don't think anyone"
"was really expecting it not to be"
"soldered to the board in a machine like"
"this again under two and a half pounds i"
"think it's technically 2.48 forgive me"
"lenovo"
"but yeah just a really nice machine"
"this is going to be probably very easy"
"to recommend to anyone looking for a"
"lightweight ultrabook with pretty much"
"everything under the sun"
"battery life may be the only drawback"
"but let's test it out and see i mean"
"right now from lenovo it's got a full"
"charge so as soon as this video ends i'm"
"going to start to get an idea of what"
"battery life is really like and just so"
"you know"
"i'll take brightness all the way down"
"right now"
"pretty interesting now it is going to be"
"all about you know the display in my"
"opinion because"
"if you went ahead and got the oled"
"version of this clearly you're going to"
"be working with something that's more"
"power hungry"
"with this display being that hd plus you"
"can't even see it which shows the"
"brightness level on here is good enough"
"but now you can"
"1920x1200 is more than enough for the"
"majority of users"
"and it's going to be the most"
"budget-friendly and again battery life"
"should be the best with this model so in"
"all likelihood this will end up being"
"the most popular model but again"
"that oled display i think sets"
"this"
"lightweight ultrabook apart from much of"
"the competition and it's been tested to"
"military spec so"
"durable carbon fiber body you know no"
"card reader but i don't i don't fault"
"them for that this is just a really well"
"put together machine"
"should be easy to disassemble also"
"so not that there's a lot to do in there"
"other than"
"replace that nvme drive if"
"you so"
"desire so again noting carbon fiber and"
"magnesium build here"
"it's just a really slick ultrabook and"
"again probably one of the easier ones to"
"recommend you got your little"
"lenovo thinkpad"
"x1 blinking"
"dot over the eye while hibernating"
"any questions or comments about this"
"brand new lightweight marvel please feel"
"free to post them hit that like button"
"and as usual please feel free to"
"subscribe and please stay safe"
"later"
"so this is the brand new lenovo thinkpad"
"x1 yoga gen 7 intel 12th gen processors"
"and when i saw this thing i was like"
"cool it looks like the previous one a"
"very attractive laptop but the one thing"
"that i was truly hoping for was the same"
"design treatment that the yoga 9i got if"
"you guys don't remember in that review"
"they changed the design to round out the"
"edges not only did this physically look"
"better but it also feels better it just"
"feels a lot more comfortable to hold in"
"the hand not that this is terrible to"
"hold or anything but these edges are"
"sharp and it just doesn't have that"
"refinement there's tons of i o so on the"
"left hand side you have two thunderbolt"
"4 ports they both support power delivery"
"you have a usb a port hdmi this is 2.0 b"
"and then on the right hand side you have"
"another usb port and then an audio jack"
"it's still a very light laptop it's"
"about three pounds and of course this"
"being a convertible you can put it in"
"different positions you can put it all"
"the way back flat like this you can put"
"it in tent mode which by the way i would"
"like to know how many people actually"
"use tent mode just out of curiosity let"
"me know because i figure when i watch"
"content i just kind of leave it in the"
"laptop position like most normal people"
"do but the big deal is you can flip it"
"all the way around like this into a"
"tablet mode and then you can pull out"
"the included pen and start sketching on"
"the display the experience of the pen is"
"very similar to the previous one it"
"writes very well obviously this is a"
"smaller pen it's not the best for long"
"hours of drawing but to sketch down"
"notes or to make quick drawings it's"
"more than adequate now we have to have a"
"conversation about the track point"
"otherwise known as the nipple as you"
"guys know i've touched tons of nipples i"
"touch nipples all the time and i'm at"
"the point now where i don't want to"
"touch them anymore not because i don't"
"like touching them they feel good it's"
"just that it's no longer needed you know"
"there was a time in a place where the"
"track point was superior i get it it"
"used to be an iconic feature with the"
"ibm brand lenovo bought it from them but"
"today the regular touchpad is so much"
"better it's more accurate it's it's"
"easier to use and having the nipple"
"there takes up real estate this stuff"
"over here is eating into potential"
"touchpad space and touchpads today are"
"meant to be big and having that extra"
"space makes it a lot easier to use now"
"the keyboard if you've ever used a"
"thinkpad keyboard you know is excellent"
"the tactile typing experience is great"
"it just feels so good to type on of"
"course you have backlighting so you can"
"see in the dark but you also have these"
"unified keys at the top that give you"
"quick access to certain settings you"
"want to hang up on your mom there's a"
"hang up button you want to access your"
"favorites it's over there too same with"
"a little bit of a text message option"
"now the sound system on this is very"
"good does support dolby atmos it's nice"
"and clear and crisp it does get quite"
"loud you have two speakers on the top"
"and then of course you have two woofers"
"on the bottom now my display is"
"1920x1200 and there's actually three"
"different 1920 by 1200 displays to"
"choose from some are anti-reflective"
"some are anti-smudge they're all a"
"little bit different but they all"
"support"
"good brightness at around 400 nits"
"they're all ips and they all have good"
"color gamut if you want oled you have to"
"go with the qhd plus option that's the"
"only higher resolution model available"
"now you do have a big beautiful 14 inch"
"display with a full hd camera at the top"
"it does support facial recognition so"
"windows hello but you also have a"
"fingerprint scanner embedded into the"
"power button now this model is the i7"
"1260p there's also a 1270p if you want"
"32 gigabytes of ram but this one maxes"
"out at 16 14 inch display 512 gigabyte"
"nvme ssd and it retails for about 2100"
"that's expensive it's aimed towards"
"business professionals companies buy"
"these for their employees if you're a"
"regular consumer look at the yoga 9i or"
"the slim 7 pro x"
"but from a performance standpoint it is"
"bump up from last year's 11th gen but i"
"feel like there's a lot of performance"
"missing on the table these 12th gen p"
"chips require a lot more power and"
"lenovo is prioritizing fan noise over"
"everything at the end of the day"
"business users are getting this and they"
"don't want to hear fans so even when"
"this thing is on best performance the"
"loudest it's going to get is 45 decibels"
"and then after a while when it hits 100"
"degrees celsius because it does and it"
"also thermal throttles it has to lower"
"the power really low in order to keep"
"the temperatures lower now this is"
"awesome all the screws are captive"
"screws meaning when you unscrew them and"
"they're loose"
"they're not going to get lost they're"
"going to stick to the case of the laptop"
"i like that kind of stuff internally you"
"have a big 57 watt hour battery i got"
"about like eight hours to eight and a"
"half hours of use before needing to"
"charge of course you have your big"
"copper heat pipe over here two fans ram"
"is soldered onto the motherboard it"
"looks like the wi-fi 6e card is two but"
"you can upgrade the nvme ssd if you"
"really want to so this is how you should"
"look at this this is the same thinkpad"
"x1 yoga as last year in terms of design"
"and feel and function you got the good"
"keyboard tons of io good battery life"
"nice build quality all the business"
"features the only thing it doesn't have"
"is really great performance the"
"performance is good enough if you're in"
"excel all day but as soon as you start"
"trying to push it let's say video work"
"or anything else it's just not the"
"laptop for you this is a laptop for"
"kevin and he him in it who needs to"
"update his thinkpad from seven years ago"
"so that he can make organizational units"
"a bit faster it's for donnie nonbinary"
"in hr who needs a device that he can"
"sketch on or maybe it's for sheila"
"she her"
"who just needs a new laptop because she"
"dropped hers in the pool a few weeks ago"
"that's who it's for it's for corporate"
"to update from older devices and still"
"get that thinkpad experience but please"
"take away the nipple it's time to go and"
"i'm sick of touching them if you have"
"any more questions let me know in the"
"comments section down below like the"
"video if you liked it subscribe if you"
"haven't already and i'll see you guys on"
"the next one"
"[Music]"
"you"
"hello and welcome to pc mag's coverage"
"of ces 2022 before the show started"
"lenovo gave us a sneak peek at some of"
"the coolest new laptops and other"
"products that they're launching during"
"this year's show so right now we're"
"going to take you to a lenovo product"
"manager showing off the snazzy new"
"thinkpad x series of laptops here we"
"have the 10th generation of our x1"
"carbon that's going to be a 14 inch full"
"performance notebook it's it's truly the"
"best business pc"
"in the middle here we have our x1 nano"
"which is basically the little brother of"
"the x1 carbon it's everything you know"
"and love about the carbon just in that"
"thinner and lighter form factor it's 13"
"inch just a traditional"
"notebook and it's"
"less than a kilogram"
"then we have our x1 yoga gen 7"
"and this is going to be that 14 inch no"
"compromise convertible"
"style notebook"
"so let's actually"
"take a look"
"at the x1"
"yoga here"
"so from a top down view i want to show"
"off the the big design update here which"
"is going to be our communication bar"
"like i said collaboration is"
"very critical"
"so we integrated higher resolution fhd"
"cameras which do take up more space than"
"that 720p hd camera"
"so we're able to put in what we call the"
"communications bar which is going to be"
"able to have that fhd camera without"
"increasing that top bezel size and we"
"also have four 360 degree mics along the"
"top bezel here too for really great"
"audio"
"digital eye strain 2 is becoming more"
"prevalent so we're"
"finding that 65 or more of active pc"
"users are reporting symptoms of eye"
"fatigue"
"so i save certified low blue light"
"displays they're going to help reduce"
"that harmful spectrum of light without"
"changing color accuracy"
"now if we can get this um"
"so we have oled displays"
"oled is great because it provides really"
"vivid visuals and it's been a really hot"
"request from customers all over the"
"world we have it back on the x1 yoga gen"
"7 and for the first time ever on our x1"
"carbon so we're really excited to offer"
"that display option for these two"
"products"
"we also have a new innovation called"
"computer vision technology and that's"
"basically going to analyze metadata from"
"the webcam as you're using your pc in"
"front of you and it's going to give you"
"features like wake on approach and lock"
"on leave like traditional hpd"
"type"
"functionalities and then there's also"
"what's called attention tracking and if"
"you're um looking at your display you"
"have it on full brightness probably and"
"then let's say you have somebody come up"
"and talk to you off to the side so your"
"attention is"
"off of your display you're looking"
"somewhere else"
"the brightness on your display is going"
"to come down to help conserve on battery"
"and that's"
"really great for power management and"
"just extending your battery life in"
"general"
"there's also things like privacy alert"
"when there's somebody overlooking"
"like over your shoulder looking at your"
"display it will alert you saying that"
"you know you might have"
"the information on your display"
"compromise someone's looking at it and"
"then also digital wellness alerts like a"
"posture warning if you're not sitting up"
"straight"
"um"
"so let's take a look at"
"the"
"um x1 carbon"
"so"
"here i have"
"taken apart"
"the bottom cover of an x1 carbon and i"
"had mentioned"
"a little bit about performance already"
"and how we've increased the performance"
"of these pretty significantly gen to gen"
"so we one of the ways we were able to do"
"that was with this air intake keyboard"
"design so here you have the planer board"
"and the dual fan system"
"now underneath here we have implemented"
"this air intake keyboard which is going"
"to be able to take air in from the"
"keyboard"
"and be able to disperse it into this"
"dual fan system"
"to then expel that hot air that's"
"generated out the um"
"back of the system"
"so this is really going to be able to"
"help us"
"get that highest performance out of that"
"p series"
"cpu from intel"
"and what's actually really cool about"
"this and maybe my favorite part is that"
"we were able to maintain the spill"
"resistance of the keyboard so if you"
"ever have accidents and maybe spill a"
"little bit of water or coffee on on your"
"laptop that should still work"
"now"
"the biggest improvement that we've done"
"for"
"our x1 series in terms of performance is"
"definitely around our nano so"
"the first generation of x1 nano we came"
"out with last year and that had the up4"
"intel cpu"
"and this year we really cranked it up"
"two notches so now we're offering p28"
"up to 32 gigs of memory and"
"you can see um"
"that"
"we really had to do a lot here because"
"the the size of the x1 nano is it's so"
"much more compact it's less than a"
"kilogram it's 14 millimeters thin"
"um so"
"we um we really had to tweak our"
"thermals a lot to really be able to"
"get that"
"that same level of performance out of"
"our x1 nano that we do have on our x1"
"carbon and yoga"
"[Music]"
"so what if you could have a 16-inch"
"touch display that was also a computer"
"you could pack up to carry"
"but that could also convert to a 12-inch"
"laptop but that was"
"also durable enough to gain mil-spec"
"certification"
"i know let me explain"
"[Music]"
"this is the 2022 lenovo thinkpad x1 fold"
"and regardless of what you thought of"
"its earlier predecessor from two years"
"ago"
"this is not that computer i mean if you"
"remember michael fisher did all he could"
"to love it but could not but it was"
"mainly because at the time it was pretty"
"experimental"
"this year's x1 fold is a completely"
"different animal with a couple of use"
"cases that"
"make all the logical sense in the world"
"reporting from both new york city and"
"berlin with adam lane on camera i'm"
"hammering out with pocket now and let's"
"dive into our hands-on"
"[Applause]"
"so let's get a few obvious things out of"
"the way yes this new thinkpad x1 fold is"
"a complete redesign from what we had"
"before"
"this baby is not trying to be a tablet"
"one bit to envision it correctly think"
"more of the fact that it has thinkpad in"
"the name and consider it more of a"
"laptop that can become something else so"
"yeah instead of the extended 13-inch"
"display think larger now with a panel"
"that goes all the way to 16.3 inches"
"instead of the chunky build from the"
"past thing thinner and more refined than"
"before"
"instead of just some weird netbook when"
"folded now we're talking about a 12-inch"
"equivalent instead making this feel more"
"like a real notebook computer surely we"
"do lose the kickstand that was built in"
"but i'm actually not going to complain"
"because this feels so much easier to"
"carry from one room to the next lenovo"
"actually made it more modular on the"
"inside the textured back can be removed"
"for you to replace the ssd for more"
"storage and even the option to get a"
"larger battery making it pretty crazy"
"that they were able to make this device"
"thinner but without affecting"
"serviceability obviously that means it's"
"not water resistant but it's mil-spec"
"810g certified so"
"i wouldn't worry too much about dropping"
"it in the field but just keep your"
"coffee in the cup and you'll be fine now"
"while extended this new sharp panel is"
"now of 2.5 k resolution and double the"
"brightness at 600 nits making the"
"experience pretty crisp detailed and"
"more versatile for outdoor use lenovo"
"now provides a stand that's easy to"
"collapse and carry but which i think you"
"might just want to leave in one place"
"for you to prop the device up and use in"
"either portrait or landscape orientation"
"depending on your needs for the day the"
"cramped bluetooth keyboard from before"
"is now gone in favor of a true thinkpad"
"nano size keyboard that can magnetically"
"attach to the stand and help you get"
"work done as if this were some sort of"
"large desktop the trackpad is now"
"finally of a decent size and you even"
"get a touch point making this more of a"
"product you'll want to use for prolonged"
"periods of time this panel also includes"
"full wacom digitizer support making the"
"pen not just any typical stylus the"
"screen is strong enough to truly support"
"anyone's desire to get fully artistic on"
"a much larger canvas though if you're"
"wondering if this is glass it's more"
"like plastic obviously the claim to fame"
"for the computer is the fact that it can"
"fold so once you remove it from the"
"stand you can then fold it into a"
"smaller form factor that's more"
"reminiscent to apple's old 12-inch"
"macbook and where the keyboard now"
"attaches to the bottom portion for this"
"to be a regular laptop now since the"
"fold flat hinge was completely"
"redesigned you won't really be able to"
"carry the keyboard within as you could"
"before but i'll forgive it given how"
"compact it becomes when closed which"
"takes advantage of a bell-shaped design"
"when folded to spare you from a"
"pronounced crease other perks include a"
"better placement for the ir webcam which"
"provides windows hello functionality in"
"all orientations you have three usb-c"
"ports out of which two support"
"thunderbolt 4 so there's one or two"
"available no matter how you place it"
"heck there's even a third speaker built"
"in so that stereo audio is available on"
"all modes and addressing one of the"
"biggest pain points of its predecessor"
"now as for internals we're talking"
"intel's 12th generation u9 core i9"
"processor up to 12 gigs of ram one"
"terabyte of storage intel iris xc"
"graphics the latest wi-fi bluetooth and"
"even 5g support which comes optional the"
"battery might not be the largest but it"
"can rapid charge and again you do have"
"the option to replace it last but not"
"least we have windows 11 which is"
"clearly better designed for a product"
"like this than windows 10 was"
"this allows for snapping in a far more"
"seamless way and for the short time i"
"use this prototype i can tell you it"
"fits like a glove this new thinkpad is"
"far more snappy and responsive than"
"before which is definitely what the"
"creatives and business users at targets"
"are looking for starting price is 24.99"
"and with the expected launch date of"
"november 2022 from just a few hours of"
"views i do have to tell you this is a"
"far better product than before one i'd"
"be willing to consider at least from"
"first impressions obviously we'll give"
"you a final verdict on what it's like to"
"actually use it in the real world in our"
"full review which should come later this"
"year but so far so good let us know what"
