Love it so far Yes very light and soft touch to use,0.418,0.0,0.582,0.8008,Positive
Out of the box the X1 Carbon is an impressive machine  Very light weight and aesthetically pleasing  The keyboard is a pleasure to use and the touchpad is much better than other PCs Ive recently used  The model I have has the standard 1920 x 1080 display which is fine for an ultraportable  Should you desire something comparable to a Mac Retina display I recommend upgrading to the Lenovo hires HDR display  For typical business use  email MS Office web browsing video conferencing etc the Intel 8th Gen i5 processor 256GB SSD and 8GB RAM configuration is fine  The X1 also has a good array of ports including USB Atype USBCThunderbolt and HDMI  After a few days of use battery life is impressive  probably 10 hours with web browsing Office and email usage  The only knock Id give it in terms of hardware is the lid has a lot of flex to it but I suppose this is to be expected since its not aluminum  The other negative is not the fault of the hardware but rather Windows 10  Setup was tedious  After going through multiple rounds of updates taking a couple of hours I had to do a full reset and start over because the Start Menu would not save any changes  I would delete the Windows Games and other bloatware I dont need only to have it reappear  I am not set up on a domain where a Group Policy is doing this so I decided to reset and that solved the problem  I also had to do a BIOS update and some Lenovodictated driver updates  After three days of use all has been good  Within this price range I have recently used a Microsoft Surface Laptop and a new Dell XPS 13 and prefer this Lenovo to either of those,0.094,0.04,0.867,0.8589,Positive
Pc worked well for about 10 months did a software update and network card got messed up by Lenovos own upgrade and they were imposible to reach for support out of 10 different contact people only 1 was courteous motivated to correct issue ended up using a local repair center to solve issue,0.236,0.04,0.724,0.8625,Positive
Very good laptop for everyday work outsidegood battery life absolutely love the matte screenultra portablevery fastbest keyboard ever fingerprint scan is terrible cam speakers the notorious quality check of Lenovo strikes back mine has an issue with the trackpad which is not working on the left side Didnt send it back though could be better looking for that amount of money spent,0.141,0.113,0.746,0.4742,Positive
Excellent piece of laptopLight waight and powerfull with excelent performanceIm glad that I didnt temptate to upgrade to the version with touch screen and higher resolotion since the exsiting capabilities regular screen with FHD are more than enoughIts just despointing that in that price its not supplied with the USBC travel hub VGA Ethernet port,0.114,0.0,0.886,0.7717,Positive
Love the machine It is very light weight has a durable look and feel though the carbon surface catches dirt marks easily The battery life is good The only thing I dont like about IIt is that battery is fixed inside and you cant change it or remove it with unscrewing the back cover I had requested for a Windows 10 pro upgrade which the seller did free of cost,0.166,0.058,0.776,0.8515,Positive
I bought it as a gift and when we start using it it gets dangerously hot 80C using only chrome or basic tasks in the office and if I use any heavier software Im afraid something will happen It is impossible to use the keyboard because the buttons are very hot and this happens using it only for 10 minutes Unfortunately I dont recommend it When I opened it to see if the fan was working its too small and not enough And since I am far from the United States I cant exchange anymore,0.082,0.077,0.841,0.1255,Positive
It is gorgeous Using DHL as a means of shipment is equivalent to that you need no worry about customs affairs which drove me crazy when I attempted to purchase another item in the United States to the United Kingdom Even the price is added with customs VAT and international handling fee and is compared with that of United Kingdom it is still cheap,0.166,0.1,0.734,0.7096,Positive
I purchased this laptop for our CFO of the company to replace his Lenovo W530  He wanted speed but something lighter than his monster W530  This has been a perfect replacement for him in terms of speed screen image quality and weight  No issues with it at all after almost 3 months of use  Always complements that this is the best laptop he has used,0.149,0.039,0.812,0.8765,Positive
This is the best laptop Ive ever had Extremely light weight and powerful Battery life is amazing it lasts all day long I dont even bring my charger to the office with me I just leave it at home Fingerprint reader is great My only complaint is that I need a dongle for Ethernet,0.239,0.055,0.706,0.926,Positive
This laptop is really suitable for collage student The best thing about it is the weight Carrying it is as light and easy as carrying an iPad I really love it though it is quite expensive Btw i5 is good enough and i7 can cost extra money so choose i5 to save money,0.273,0.0,0.727,0.9565,Positive

I purchased a Lenovo X1 Carbon i7 16GB RAM 1TB SSD HD after having some hardware issues with other work laptops I needed a high end limited frills portable laptop to do heavy duty business work on And not much else I dont play games or watch movies on this I dont do graphics or rendering work I dont code Other than work heavy duty officesuite use software used through browsers etc all I need this computer for is an occasional youtube videoWhat Ive dealt with since receiving this machine has turned me off from Lenovo forever The computer itself is as advertisedlight powerful simple No touch screen the keyboard is decent everything else is great So far Id give it a BEXCEPT yesterday it started having charging issues after 15 days of use The computer isnt charging correctly its indicating its connected when its not and its telling me that the power cord I have is the wrong wattage for this computer Even though its a not and b been working fine since I got it And my external monitor flashes on and off According to the Lenovo client all of my stuff is uptodate and working correctlyEnter Lenovos superior customer support team to fix my issues right awayJUST KIDDINGEnter Lenovos frustrating but navigateable menu and wait for itA SALES AND SUPPORT TEAM THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM 9PM EST ON FRIDAY UNTIL 9AM EST ON MONDAYCan you imagine A company with an enterprise value north of 13BN and they wont pay for support on the weekends UnfreakingbelievableFurthermore the support staff I talked to before they locked up the office for the weekend said that the turnaround time to repair my computer would be 7 business days Like no big deal right Ill just use pen and paper for a week and a half while my twoweekold computer maybe gets fixedOr I could talk to sales about getting a new one sent to me so I can spend a few hours getting my new computer set up and the old one wiped then sent back to you Oh but they dont work on the weekends either You CAN however order a new product by talking to someone through chat on the weekends but no sales support or technical supportOR I could take my computer to a certified Lenovo repair site I live in the SF Bay Areahardly the middle of nowhereThere is one location within an hour of meAnd its closed on the weekendsTheres one more right at an hour from me Im not sure if its open on the weekends They didnt answer their phone and their website hasnt been updated since 2009So here I am wasting my Saturday and NOT spending time with my family because Im trying to resolve computer issues on a brand new computer with a giant corporation that has 0 resources available to support me on the weekends as I prepare to get on the road for work tomorrow for a week Fortunately Ill be backlate FridayJUST IN TIME FOR THEM TO CLOSE UP SHOP FOR THE WEEKEND AGAINThinkPad products might be great Im not sure Ive heard decent things But if you end up with a lemon better start blocking off big chunks of time on your calendar to fix it yourself because youre going to be left high and dry by Lenovo Because who really cares about the little guy right Its just some shmuck who bought a 2500 laptop computer from an IBM owned company,0.089,0.055,0.856,0.9736,Positive
After going through several xps 13 and x1 carbons I sell electronics I replaced my XPS13 9370 8250u laptop with this X1 carbon ultrabook and overall i like this one better  The xps had brighter screen and better color reproduction much nicer design better batteryThe x1 carbon has the same weight as xps 13 which was a decisive point for me  and as a bonus a bigger and more usable 14 screen While the trackpad on xps 13 is slightly better both are great the keyboard on the x1 is absolutely amazing in comparison to xps 13 which is also good but nowhere near as greatThe X1 carbon has a worse thermal solution than the xps 13 and as a result is obnoxiously louder and runs hotter I solved this issue by repasting the heatsink with noctua nth1 paste i recommend this one its easy to spread compared to other paste After repasting the XPS13 i couldnt hear the fans anymore but on the X1 carbon they where still on more often than i likeThere is a software called ThrottleStop that helped me lower the temperatures down  improve the battery life and make fans silent  It can be configured to run minimized automatically on windows startup task schedulerBefore temps where at 38c Min  65C maximum Now they are at 27c Min 44C maxFor reading PDFs and using Office Word on this laptop i turned off turbo boost and undervolted a few option settings The cpu now consumes as low as 01w power and 375w maxI wouldnt recommend any ultrabook that has a 4k display or i7 CPU i previously had both on xps 13 and carbon x1While the 4k is very nice to look at it makes the ultrabook run a lot hotter  The same goes for the CPU which is also a waste of money in comparison to an i5 If performance is important you shouldnt buy an ultrabook at all,0.154,0.051,0.795,0.9817,Positive
Bought recently at one of the large wholesale stores with 16GB RAM Intel i7 and 500 GB SSD Comes with 2 USBC  Thunderbolt ports 2 USBA ports and an HDMI port Typically use wifi at home but bought a Lenovo ethernet adapter in case I need it for work and it works great Setup was very easy even though this was my first experience with Windows 10 use Windows 7 at my office This with 14 screen replaced my 9 yr old HP EliteBook 8540 with 156 screen and I really dont notice the screen being a little smaller Keyboard is awesome This model and its charger are compact light and easy to carry Recommend highlyFYI Id probably have gone with the i5 chip and 1 TB SSD but I got a good deal on this preconfigured model at the large wholesaler,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.9834,Positive

A decade of laptop design culminates in todays review unit the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 As the name implies it is the tenth generation of the X1 Carbon series  Compared to that first model a lot of things have changed but in comparison to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G9 the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 is not a huge update,0.0,0.041,0.959,-0.3491,Negative
Lenovo uses the same chassis design for at least two generations As the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G9 was a huge redesign the X1 Carbon G10 is a refresh which keeps the old design intact It is a chassis that is mature enough for everyday use A more detailed description of the chassis and its quality can be found in our comprehensive review of the ,0.137,0.0,0.863,0.7845,Positive
There is one relevant design change Lenovo had to implement a little reverse notch to implement the new webcams The small protrusion at the center of the screen makes it easier to open the screen Models with the new webcams like the reviewed variant are 05 mm thicker than the preceding model,0.098,0.0,0.902,0.6486,Positive
There are no changes to the ports the ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2022 offers Thunderbolt 4 as well as legacy ports like USB A and HDMI despite the compact chassis We do miss an SD card reader with this model,0.111,0.092,0.797,0.2023,Positive
Compared with the predecessor the Intel Wireless AX211 2x2 has been added as a new option which is also present in our review sample Different from the AX201 the AX211 supports the new standard WiFi 6E We did not use it in our test but the WiFi module is still faster than the AX201 of the X1 Carbon G9,0.03,0.0,0.97,0.1901,Positive
Normally there is little to write about when it comes to laptop cameras but with the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 the webcam is an important part of the conversation Lenovo has upped the resolution from 720p to 1080p and the X1 Carbon G10 also uses an f20 aperture which should improve low light performance,0.1,0.044,0.857,0.5267,Positive
The X1 Carbon 2022 offers most of the typical business features like dTPM 20 a Kensington lock slot or a fingerprint reader At the same time smartcard reader is not on board although you will find on regular TX ThinkPads New is the Computervision feature for the webcam with Human Presence Detection The system recognizes if the user is stepping away from the device and automatically locks it This function is optional and can be disabled in the Lenovo Commercial Vantage app,0.068,0.0,0.932,0.694,Positive
In the box there is the 65 W charger with a USBC plug and no other accessories Praiseworthy the box and the outer packaging are completely made out of paper for the first time Lenovo dispensed the plastics used here before,0.084,0.051,0.864,0.34,Positive
There are no changes to the maintenance design of the predecessor The Carbon fiber bottom cover can be easily removed only five screws and a few clips at the back of the system have to be loosened The M2 2280 SSD is upgradeable the RAM is soldered The same is true for the WiFi module On the other hand a WWAN card can be slotted in since our model has the antennas and the SIM slot But only 4G is possible as 5G requires additional antennas,0.065,0.035,0.9,0.3818,Positive
In the tested configuration the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10 has three years of warranty which includes onsite service In case of a defect the Lenovo laptop will be repaired at the home or workplace of the customers This is only true for the country the device was bought in Internationally it is a standard depot warranty,0.047,0.041,0.912,0.1027,Positive
Lenovo uses almost the same keyboard as with the predecessor X1 Carbon G9 but the chiclet keyboard with the backlight and six rows of keys is changed in one aspect the keys of the first row and the keys on the left and right edge of the keyboard like Enter Ctrl or Shift are now square instead of rounded The typing feel is not affected it is purely a visual change The keyboard is still very comfortable with 15 mm travel a good layout and a very satisfying typing experience That being said older ThinkPads with more travel are better,0.197,0.0,0.803,0.973,Positive
Among the ThinkPads the X1 models have a special position as they are the only devices with a glass touchpad  though this really is not true anymore as the ThinkPad Z series is being released at the moment and it also has a glass touchpad The comparison with the Z series is interesting as the ThinkPad Z13 has a new touchpad design without dedicated TrackPoint buttons This function is fulfilled by the haptic feedback,0.108,0.067,0.826,0.4809,Positive
For a refresh like the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 a possible venue for changes is the screen This is true here as well as Lenovo uses the opportunity to introduce new screen options But in the case of our review device the 14inch 1610 screen we are reviewing was available in the predecessor already,0.127,0.0,0.873,0.6249,Positive
Ex factory the colors are slightly too warm which we measured with CalMan and the XRite i1 Pro 2 color spectrophotometer Calibrated with the XRite i1 Profiler the colors are pretty neutral with the biggest remaining inaccuracy in the red color space The ICC profile we created is available for free download,0.177,0.0,0.823,0.8451,Positive
Due to the matte screen surface the display is usable outdoors though the missing nits of the panel used here are noticeable,0.0,0.095,0.905,-0.296,Negative
ThinkPads are known for having many configurations available With the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 Lenovo makes choosing the right model even more complicated as there are now two different classes of CPUs available Intel Alder Lake in its U15 and P28 variants with vPro Enterprise and vPro Essential versions AMD CPUs are not on the table and neither are dedicated GPUs,0.0,0.04,0.96,-0.357,Negative
Lenovo uses the Windows energy settings for power management For our tests we are using the mode best performance and disabled the Lenovo Intelligent Cooling mode Auto FN  T This results in a shortterm Powerlimit 1 of 55 W and a longterm Powerlimit 2 of 15 W Our WiFi battery test was performed with the mode Balanced PL1 20 W  PL2 11 W,0.154,0.0,0.846,0.8519,Positive
The  is a processor with fourplus eight asymmetrical cores 4 P  8 E cores of the newest generation Intel Alder Lake As a CPU of the P class it has a typical TDP of 28 W though this is just a rough orientation It is a vPro Enterprise variant of the  which is almost identical to the i51250P clock rates P cores 17 up to 44 GHz E cores 12 up to 33 GHz Comparisons with other processors are possible with the ,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The system performance is good there are no hiccups in everyday browser usage Once again though the benchmarks show that the performance has not substantially improved compared to the predecessor ,0.083,0.143,0.774,-0.2665,Negative
For working with audio the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 2022 is not suitable at least not in the reviewed configuration since it has DPC latency problems This holds true in the Youtube test as well as there are dropped frames Lenovo would have to release a driver update,0.095,0.052,0.853,0.296,Positive
The  is the iGPU of all i5 CPUs from the UPseries for the years 2021 and 2022 Its performance is dependent on the system memory as the iGPU does not have dedicated memory In the case of the X1 Carbon G10 it is fast LPDDR5 memory in a quadchannel configuration which is ideal for the Intel Xe Despite this the iGPU does not perform as well as it could which is probably due to the thermal constraints of the ThinkPad laptop The Dell Latitude 7420 with the same iGPU performs better in the 3DMark tests,0.063,0.043,0.895,0.4599,Positive
Gaming after the work is not possible with the ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 apart from older titles In any case the quality and resolution have to be lowered,0.0,0.053,0.947,-0.128,Negative
The Witcher 3 test shows once again that the X1 Carbon 2022 has problems with the cooling The performance of the iGPU is not stable,0.0,0.173,0.827,-0.5556,Negative
Surprisingly the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 is a rather quiet system When idling the two small fans stay completely quiet Under load they reach 3547 dBa  a moderate level for the maximum fan speed We think Lenovo could have the fans run a little louder to squeeze some more performance out of the CPU,0.103,0.0,0.897,0.5574,Positive
Despite the quiet fans the Lenovo laptop X1 Carbon 2022 does not get overly hot In the stress test and Witcher 3 test the highest temperatures were measured at the top 45 degrees Celsius or 113 F above the keyboard The palmrest stays cool in every case A bit annoying is the hot keyboard during the Witcher 3 test but since the ThinkPad is not a gaming laptop this should not be an issue in everyday use,0.041,0.05,0.909,-0.1779,Negative
The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 has four speakers two on the bottom and two on top next to the keyboard They are sufficiently loud and they do have some bass but there is still a lot of room for improvement,0.124,0.0,0.876,0.6597,Positive
The power consumption of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 is good the competitors from last year consume more energy The X1 Carbon G9 consumes less only for the maximum idle consumption,0.15,0.0,0.85,0.6478,Positive
For the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon G10 the platform upgrade to Intel Alder Lake is the main focus In the case of the reviewed unit it is Alder Lake P28 All things considered we can say the new generation fails to meet our expectations,0.0,0.061,0.939,-0.4215,Negative

now given that this is a lenovo laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pricing is certainly not the most,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.34,Positive
consistent factor just because there are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
many sales going around from a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
monthtomonth basis with huge discounts,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
so you could end up picking one up for a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really good deal but then again,0.295,0.0,0.705,0.2724,Positive
examining their retail value ive come,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.34,Positive
to realize that its actually more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
expensive than the xps 13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the razer book 13 and most definitely,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4576,Positive
the zenbook 13 oled so what exactly are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

combination of carbon fiber and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
magnesium alloy to enhance durability,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

built really well and you can sort of,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.3384,Positive
feel that the moment you unbox this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thing the only thing to watch out for is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wear and tear over time because this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
material especially with the palm rest,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and obviously a carbon fiber finish is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that it picks up finger oil easily so,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.34,Positive
youll have to make sure to clean this,0.455,0.0,0.545,0.6124,Positive
every now and then to maintain its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
aesthetics speaking of which i really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

with the laptops on their laps as for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
size keep in mind that this has a 14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
inch display so its a little bit bigger,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
than my xps 13 and even the razer book,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
13 its still very thin coming in at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
059 inches or 149 millimeters and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
given the carbon fiber and magnesium,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
alloy construction it only weighs around,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
25 pounds which is the lightest thinner,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

devices moving forward the interior,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
space is very similar compared to last,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

wellknown track point right at the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
center along with its own dedicated,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.4588,Positive

the function and control keys are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
positioned differently but thats a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thinkpot hallmark so if you really find,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that annoying you can just go into,0.0,0.31,0.69,-0.4019,Negative
vantage and switch that up which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
definitely a nice,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6705,Positive
option that they offer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the power button also acts as a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fingerprint reader and it works really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
well theres also a separate chip inside,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive

to try one of these for a while because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its been the gold standard for years,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

which is a huge bonus,0.744,0.0,0.256,0.7003,Positive
im actually going to let mike chime in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on his experience compared to his older,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
6th gen x1 carbon because he actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
noticed a few interesting observations,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.4019,Positive
so thats definitely worth on mentioning,0.562,0.0,0.438,0.63,Positive
or worth watching they made the trackpad,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
slightly wider and given that it has a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
glass surface navigating within windows,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was just a breeze its actually a very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
similar experience compared to the xps,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
13 i also have to mention that the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
integrated left and right buttons are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
excellent in fact its tactile but at,0.281,0.0,0.719,0.3291,Positive
the same time also mushy its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one of the best things that ive,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
experienced on a laptop i think im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to do a quick sound test just to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
give you guys a quick idea or just a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
rough idea on how this thing feels,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
taking a look at the i o im actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
impressed with what the thinkpad offers,0.383,0.0,0.617,0.4767,Positive
considering its low profile design so on,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.2732,Negative
the left hand side you get a few,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
thunderbolt 4 ports a usb type a 32 gen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
1 port an hdmi 20 port switching over,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

kensington lock another usb type a 32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gen 1 port and a headphone jack im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually a little disappointed that they,0.0,0.412,0.588,-0.4228,Negative
didnt include usb 32 gen 2 ports,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because they have twice the bandwidth,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
compared to gen 1 um it could be a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
design limitation but its still weird,0.0,0.477,0.523,-0.3919,Negative
to see on laptop that costs,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so much money moving on to the display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and one of the biggest upgrades from gen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
8 to gen 9 is the inclusion of a 16 by,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
10 screen which gives you more vertical,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
screen real estate so you can have more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
content filling up your screen i have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the uhd plus 60hz nontouch variant and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

it covers 100 srgb 91 adobe rgb and 99,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dcip3 thats oled level guys which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
amazing and on top of that it gets super,0.613,0.0,0.387,0.8591,Positive
bright our sample goes as far as 514,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
hits so whether if youre a professional,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
photographer or just someone who works,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on presentations for your company,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre seriously in for a treat my only,0.287,0.181,0.532,0.25,Positive
issue though is its a glossy finish and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lenovo hasnt added any antireflective,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coating to cut down the reflections plus,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.2732,Negative
this panel doesnt have the privacy,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
guard feature that disables the view,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
angle from both left and right to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
protect the content on the screen you,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
only get that feature with the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
1200pm matte display option which is 500,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
nits so just keep that in mind,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but also another thing to note is that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
those panels take a slight hit on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
color gamut so what im going to do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right now is let mike chime in with his,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thoughts on the new x1 carbon so take it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
away man all right guys eber asked me to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

thinkpad users i dont want there to be,0.0,0.169,0.831,-0.0572,Negative
any changes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to the thinkpad unless its absolutely,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
necessary so what are my thoughts about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this x1 carbon and ive been using this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for about a week for the most part the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
changes that have been made,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
intergenerationally theyve been for the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better for example that 16x10 screen,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
that theyre now using from a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
productivity standpoint its a huge,0.434,0.0,0.566,0.3182,Positive
upgrade now the funny thing for me is,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to that 16x10 screen i didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually realize what i was getting but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when i stepped back to my old thinkpad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats what i realized what i was losing,0.0,0.342,0.658,-0.3818,Negative
on the other hand i really have to,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
appreciate the fact that theyve,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
upgraded the finish on it mine you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
see the fingerprints and the shmu on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there from a mile and a half away the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
new one it still gets marked up quite a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit but at the same time it doesnt show,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quite as much of the junk as the older,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one the other thing that they really did,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
upgrade or what i think is a downgrade,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is the keyboard that thinkpad keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
has always been legendary,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mine i love the throw distance i love,0.677,0.0,0.323,0.8555,Positive
the fact that theres a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tactile feedback it just feels right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the new one its really hard to describe,0.0,0.195,0.805,-0.1761,Negative
this and im going to struggle with,0.0,0.277,0.723,-0.3182,Negative
words here a little bit but it almost,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feels like they pulled a little bit of,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
the life out of that older thinkpad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard in order to make it maybe a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit more low profile in order to,0.0,0.233,0.767,-0.2799,Negative
fit upgraded components inside other,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
than that the port selection is the same,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so you dont need to go to dongle life,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like you do with the xps 13 for example,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
lenovo kept all of the ports that were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there and upgraded the ones that needed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to be upgraded the last thing i wanted,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to mention is the webcam because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
something that i noticed again and again,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and again over the conference calls that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i had in the last week or so so lets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the new x1 carbon to really really hope,0.332,0.0,0.668,0.5379,Positive
that it looks a lot better than this one,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
and welcome to the ninth generation,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.4588,Positive
thinkpad x1 carbon and what can i say,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oh my god i in some ways it has actually,0.208,0.0,0.792,0.2732,Positive
gotten worse than three years ago so,0.0,0.341,0.659,-0.4767,Negative
first of all theres this odd sharpening,0.0,0.304,0.696,-0.3869,Negative
going on and yes i dont look like i was,0.25,0.195,0.555,0.1506,Positive
smeared with vaseline except now i look,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like i have craters all over my face or,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
something not only that is that the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors are so subdued it to me it really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really doesnt look good even looking at,0.0,0.308,0.692,-0.3959,Negative
in this screen right now it almost looks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
black and white im wondering if the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actual recording is going to be like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
that other than that i mean luckily auto,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.5106,Positive
exposure turns itself off completely now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so you can really balance that one way,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or another but otherwise,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i really want to know what you guys,0.21,0.0,0.79,0.1513,Positive
think about this to me,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its a disappointment theres a,0.0,0.623,0.377,-0.5106,Negative
professional device and yes youre going,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
to be seen on on zoom calls so a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little talking head down there but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
how is it looking like this and,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
what ive done here is ive gone through,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the settings to do the best possible,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
capture and this is it guys,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what do you think so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yeah that webcam test didnt go as well,0.22,0.181,0.599,0.0992,Positive
as we thought it would but hey on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
positive side theyve implemented dual,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.5574,Positive
frontfacing speakers with this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
generation and it sounds amazing there,0.432,0.0,0.568,0.5859,Positive
is good clarity in the high end and the,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.6808,Positive
bass response is respectable to be,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
honest i didnt expect this from a,0.452,0.0,0.548,0.5106,Positive
thinkpad but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im going to take it anyway guys,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
upgradability is pretty limited on the,0.352,0.209,0.44,0.3182,Positive
x1 carbon the memory is soldered onto,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the pcb and the primary nvme ssd is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right over here and the drive speeds are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really fast specifically with reads,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
however the right performance is average,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there is a wlan slot which adopts the,0.221,0.0,0.779,0.1779,Positive
m2 interface but its strictly meant,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for networking cards i tried to install,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
my toshiba rc100 ssd but the bios,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
refused it,0.0,0.688,0.312,-0.296,Negative
now im aware that some gen 6 laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can take secondary drives but with the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gen 9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im not really sure guys but anyways,0.0,0.209,0.791,-0.1505,Negative
lets talk about battery life because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this thing has a 4k screen which to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
honest is pointless in a 14inch form,0.398,0.0,0.602,0.5106,Positive
factor but we were just interested to,0.372,0.0,0.628,0.5499,Positive
see how it stacks up with the other thin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and laptops that weve tested,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
well first of all if you want the best,0.559,0.0,0.441,0.765,Positive
battery life absolutely avoid the 4k,0.0,0.333,0.667,-0.3597,Negative
screen and maybe even think about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
grabbing the i5 instead of the i7 our,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sample has,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but even with those two things working,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
against it the x1 carbon actually gets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
some reasonable numbers at almost 13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hours in the light load test remember,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that other than the dell xps 13 all the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
other competitors here have either,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
smaller screens or lower resolutions so,0.0,0.306,0.694,-0.296,Negative
with that in mind this is actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty impressive and it makes me wonder,0.565,0.0,0.435,0.7579,Positive
if the 1200p model would come closer to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these zenbook numbers under a heavier,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
load well theres nothing to complain,0.513,0.0,0.487,0.4956,Positive
about here either with the x1 posting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the longest battery life of any thin and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
light tiger lake laptop weve seen so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
far i mean look this class of thingpad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
isnt meant for running multicore loads,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
while being unplugged but if you need to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
well at least you wont have to find an,0.208,0.0,0.792,0.2732,Positive
outlet every hour but this all leads to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
something pretty interesting about this,0.663,0.0,0.337,0.7096,Positive
laptop and thats its performance mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you see lenovo has always targeted the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
carbon series at professionals who just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
want to plug in their laptop and start,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
using it day in and day out with minimum,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
amount of fuss so that means no fiddling,0.0,0.26,0.74,-0.3535,Negative
around with settings or bloatware and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
most of all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
nothing that takes away from,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
productivity time anyways that led them,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to create a really straightforward power,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.2732,Positive
plan where the modes are switched,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
through the standard windows power,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
manager in your taskbar there are two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
auto modes that allow the system to,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
manage surface temperatures cpu speeds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and noise while favoring either a,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.4215,Positive
balanced approach or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a more performance area theres also a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
manual performance mode that simply,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
allows the processor to run at higher,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
speeds for longer periods of time you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can actually see this quite well with,0.285,0.0,0.715,0.3384,Positive
both performance and auto performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
delivering really similar power input,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right up until the fourminute mark of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
our test,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then the algorithm lenovo uses in auto,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mode dials things back to between 12 and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
15 watts until surface temperatures are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
reduced and then it kicks things up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
again,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
meanwhile performance mode simply runs,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
at 23 watts all day,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
auto balance on the other hand,0.39,0.0,0.61,0.4939,Positive
well im not sure if you want to be,0.299,0.173,0.528,0.1124,Positive
running this for any intensive tasks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
since it limits the processor to just 7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
watts thats perfect for most the folks,0.381,0.0,0.619,0.5719,Positive
who are looking at the x1 but its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
terrible for anything other than a light,0.0,0.383,0.617,-0.4767,Negative
workload you can actually see what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
happens with clock speeds when those,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
three modes are being used balanced,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
barely sticks above one gigahertz while,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the other two performance modes offer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more than double the amount of speed and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
honestly if youre in a pension trying,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.4588,Positive
to render out a file or get a bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
extra transcoding work done ditching out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the outofthebox balance mode is the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
only thing to do that all translates,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
into auto performance and performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hitting just above 95 degrees for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
shorter amounts of time before the fans,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pick up a bit of steam and draws things,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
down to a lot more reasonable levels,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but you can still see how the automatic,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
setting gets quite aggressive for a few,0.0,0.275,0.725,-0.2247,Negative
minutes before letting its foot off the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gas and it lets temperatures spike again,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it does that over and over again when,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you look at balance well its what you,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
probably expected its cool and really,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
well behaved right across the board,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
barely reaching above 50 degrees,0.274,0.0,0.726,0.1298,Positive
but good news about all of this is,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.5927,Positive
regardless of whatever mode youre in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the thinkpad x1 carbon is one of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quietest machines out here for the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
professionals and even students who buy,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these things thats pretty important,0.625,0.0,0.375,0.6124,Positive
since the last thing anyone wants is for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a meeting to be interrupted by a loud,0.0,0.306,0.694,-0.296,Negative
laptop and even when running at full,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tilt surface temperatures are well,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.2732,Positive
managed which means working with it on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your lap in the airport or in a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
classroom setting shouldnt really pose,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
any problems there is a small hotspot on,0.0,0.31,0.69,-0.4019,Negative
the back but its focused in an area,0.327,0.0,0.673,0.5267,Positive
that doesnt usually come in contact,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with your body now moving on to real,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
world benchmarks in the auto performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mode and the results here are pretty,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
much in line with what weve come to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
expect from the i7 1165 g7 in a thin and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
light laptop itll lose to the amd cpus,0.0,0.278,0.722,-0.4019,Negative
and multithreaded benchmarks since they,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have double the number of processing,0.206,0.0,0.794,0.0772,Positive
threads,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one of the other challenges here is auto,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
performance mode doesnt run at a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
constant speed so the results tend to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
vary a lot but at the same time it gives,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
excellent performance in areas where the,0.425,0.0,0.575,0.5719,Positive
x1 carbon is likely going to be used,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
most of the time and thats likely,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thread situations like word processing,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
spreadsheets exports and pdf creation,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.2732,Positive
the premiere results need a bit of an,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
explanation here because theyre almost,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
too good to be true basically whats,0.533,0.0,0.467,0.6908,Positive
happening here is lenovos doing app,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
detection in the auto performance mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were using so in this situation the xe,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
graphics gets a bit more juice and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
operates at about 225 megahertz since,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
premiere is gpu bound that little extra,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit of performance makes a big,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in longer renders like this,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
one now taking a look at gaming,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is obviously not something that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
people find themselves using the x1 for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but still i know for a fact that when we,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
used to travel to shows,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mike played civ on his carbon during,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.34,Positive
longer flights i mean its a great way,0.451,0.0,0.549,0.6249,Positive
to pass time and with the iris xc,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
graphics this generation is actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
able to play most basic titles at some,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.34,Positive
pretty decent frame rates unless you get,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
into one of those situations where,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
intels drivers end up crashing most of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the time ive got to say this is one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
area where amd really needs to step,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
things up because their vega,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
architecture is really really starting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to show its age on the laptop side of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
things so final thoughts on the x1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
carbon gen 9 from lenovo and guys im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seriously impressed with this laptop the,0.352,0.193,0.455,0.34,Positive
first thing that comes to my mind is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just how lightweight it is while being,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
extremely durable the 16x10 screen is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gorgeous and its really bright um the,0.59,0.0,0.41,0.8016,Positive
keyboard is still best in class battery,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
life is also pretty good but i would,0.448,0.0,0.552,0.4678,Positive
honestly pick up the 1200p option if you,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.4588,Positive
want to get a little bit more life out,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
of this thing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the performance is also quite nice as,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.4754,Positive
well and most importantly its one of,0.484,0.0,0.516,0.5709,Positive
the quietest laptops that weve tested,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
under heavier load situations now if you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
look at the price situation it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
expensive but what youre really paying,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for is something thats going to last,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you for years to come ahead,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you also get the enhanced security,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.34,Positive

now with the average consumer care about,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
those things,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
probably not in fact its really geared,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
towards professionals or people who work,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in the corporate side where they deal,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with classified information,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and i think most likely you might just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
end up getting one of these through work,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
instead of paying out of your own pocket,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
personally i would pick this over the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
xps 13 just because it got its got more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ports and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its matte black which is my vibe and oh,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if you do find it on sale,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and if it fits your budget i would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
definitely pick this up without even,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
thinking for a second so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on that note,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thank you so much for watching i hope,0.519,0.0,0.481,0.6597,Positive

guys think about this little thing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is my first thinkpad laptop in a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
while um and im seriously impressed,0.352,0.193,0.455,0.34,Positive
i kind of wish i,0.574,0.0,0.426,0.4019,Positive
i think i might switch from the xps 13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but i have to send this back so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yeah,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.296,Positive
anyways,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats for me guys,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

And with 5G and Wifi 6E the X1 Carbon has the industrys best connectivity,0.244,0.0,0.756,0.6369,Positive
The X1 Carbon also comes with new FHD cameras housed in a communications bar with optional computer vision,0.111,0.0,0.889,0.25,Positive
The improved camera experience combined with Dolby Voice and eyesafe certified low blue light displays gives hybrid work a whole new elevated experience,0.123,0.083,0.794,0.25,Positive
so this is the lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
9th gen very long name but a very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
popular laptop in the business world and,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
i was going to straight up review this,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
by itself but i reviewed the x1 nano,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
about a week ago and this compared to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it makes a lot of sense like these two,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
laptops are so similar in a ton of ways,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they both have that thinkpad look and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feel and the price is different one is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
700 cheaper than the other so you might,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
be asking yourself if you need to pay,0.0,0.167,0.833,-0.1027,Negative
extra or not by the end of this video,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if you look at them you can see the same,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kind of design philosophy theyre both,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mil std tested they can withstand spills,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyre theyre really light 215 pounds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for the nano compared to 249,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the carbon if youre holding them you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can feel the difference but quite,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
frankly 249 pounds is so light to begin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with that i think most people wont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
complain about the weight but the nano,0.0,0.226,0.774,-0.1901,Negative
is meant for for hardcore travel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
warriors right youre trying to pack as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
light as possible and thats what the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
nano is for because even though its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter its just a smaller laptop like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
when you put it on top of the carbon you,0.167,0.0,0.833,0.2023,Positive
can see that the laptop is not as deep,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and not as wide now this is the black,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
model but you can also get the nano with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a weave and the black model tends to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show fingerprints a lot easier compared,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.4215,Positive
to the weave which shows it too but its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not as drastic now the one thing youre,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
giving up with the nano is ports you,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.34,Positive
only get two thunderbolt 4 ports on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lefthand side so for some of you out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there that might mean carrying dongles,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with you the carbon on the other hand,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
has all the ports you can think of two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thunderbolt 4 you have your usb port,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fullsize hdmi and then when you flip it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to the other side you have another usb,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
port and your headphone jack the other,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
big difference is the keyboard deck,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres just a lot more space to work,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with on the carbon the nano is just a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit more cramped due to its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
smaller form factor the typing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
experience is identical i didnt find,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
typing on one easier over the other but,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
the touch pad is the main difference,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like you just get a lot more space to,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
move your fingers around on the carbon,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but heres the funny thing even though,0.391,0.0,0.609,0.5927,Positive
you get more space on the carbon i found,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the touchpad on the nano to be a lot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more enjoyable to use one thing i found,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
about lenovo thinkpads in general is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that the consistency of the touchpads,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
vary from unit to unit its never,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
exactly the same some just happen to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a bit better is it a big deal is it,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
drastic is it going to ruin the way you,0.0,0.322,0.678,-0.5859,Negative
use your laptop absolutely not just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
something i noticed after years and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
years of reviewing think pads the other,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thing is the fingerprint scanner this is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right beside the touch pad on the nano,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whereas on the carbon its embedded into,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the power button speakers are both on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
top of the deck but you have more,0.167,0.0,0.833,0.1027,Positive
speakers with the carbon and therefore,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you do get better sound just because,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
theres more room to work with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Applause,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4215,Positive
Music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Applause,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4215,Positive
now both of these laptops can have your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
screen flipped 180 degrees they both,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
support windows hello and they both have,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
720p webcams the webcams are nothing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
special but theyre there the other,0.27,0.0,0.73,0.2144,Positive
thing to note is lenovos smart presence,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
technology so when you approach any of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these laptops it detects that youre,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there and then scans your face and logs,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you in the moment you go away from the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop it will detect that you left and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
automatically lock your screen in case,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you forgot to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the displays are a bit different theyre,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyre both 16 by 10 the difference is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that this one happens to be 14 inches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and this is 13 quite frankly i feel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like im working on a bigger display,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
than a 13 inch display because of that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
aspect ratio and same holds true for the,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
bigger carbon the difference in color,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
accuracy really comes down to the skew,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that you decide to buy like this one you,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
can buy it with a 1900 or 1920x1200,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
display but this one happens to be 4k,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and youre just getting a lot more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brightness more color gamut to work with,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
if youre really into design this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt have such a crazy color gamut,0.289,0.0,0.711,0.2584,Positive
compared to the carbon but its still,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really good and the fact that this ones,0.313,0.0,0.687,0.4927,Positive
matte gives you less reflection if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre outdoors a lot now they did a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty good job of reducing the,0.604,0.0,0.396,0.7269,Positive
reflection on this glossy display and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its significantly less than lets say,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the surface laptop but again because you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have a glossy display theres going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
be a bit of reflection now both of these,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptops are using an i7 processor and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyre both 11th gen but there is a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference one is using a 116 zero g7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the other is a one one six five g,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seven thank you intel for making this,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
very confusing what the zero g7 means is,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.2944,Negative
that the x1 nano is using a lower tdp of,0.0,0.216,0.784,-0.296,Negative
that i7 processor this one is like a 15,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
watt processor whereas this one can go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
up to 30 watts which means the carbon is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
technically going to give you better,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
performance the funny thing though is,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
all the tests i ran the carbon did,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
perform better but it wasnt like,0.226,0.309,0.464,-0.1815,Negative
drastic you know like take this mozilla,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
compile time yes it compiled faster on,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
the carbon but it wasnt by much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if youre an editor or a designer and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre buying these for photoshop and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre doing meetings and stuff like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
that again the carbon is going to be the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better option but its not drastic and,0.245,0.0,0.755,0.2382,Positive
if youre a video editor looking for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
something light and portable these are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not it you usually want something with a,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
dedicated gpu but the beauty of using an,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.802,Positive
intel laptop with that iris xe graphics,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
chip and quick sync if youre using,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
adobe premiere pro you can still edit a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
video like you can still,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
do it i just dont recommend doing it,0.0,0.26,0.74,-0.2755,Negative
all the time and again its going to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
faster on the carbon the other thing to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
note is that these things,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can be pushed harder but lenovo aiming,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these laptops towards business users,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
want to make sure the fan noise is low,0.454,0.162,0.385,0.4215,Positive
thats why when these things are under,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
full load you can hear the fans but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyre not loud around like 43 decibels,0.0,0.26,0.74,-0.2755,Negative
heat management is also going to be good,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
because the fan noise needs to stay low,0.221,0.202,0.577,0.0516,Positive
so theyre going to power limit the cpu,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so that the the heat doesnt get too hot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the fans dont get too loud,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
internally the only thing that is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
upgradable is the nvme ssd the ram is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
completely soldered onto the motherboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the other difference is the fan layout,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
you get one big fan with the nano which,0.223,0.0,0.777,0.3182,Positive
makes sense considering this is a 15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
watt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cpu you dont really need two for it and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the carbon you have two fans since it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
has a higher tdp the other thing to note,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is the drive setup this is using a 2280,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
nvme ssd and nets youve higher read and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
write speeds the smaller nvme ssd inside,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of here is still fast but not as fast as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the carbon the battery is bigger in the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
carbon 57 watt hours compared to 47 but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heres the thing i actually got better,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
battery life on the x1 nano probably,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
most likely due to the fact that this is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not using a 4k display and this is a 13,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
inch display instead of 14 inches so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heres the thing on paper the carbon 9th,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gen makes more sense youre getting a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slightly faster computer youre getting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more ports to work with youre getting a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better sound youre getting a bigger,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
keyboard deck a much bigger touchpad to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
work with and youre getting the option,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of a bigger display but it costs,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
anywhere from five to seven hundred,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dollars more if you go with the 4k model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
over the x1 nano and if the performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was significantly better then i would,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
say it might be worth it but the,0.172,0.0,0.828,0.1154,Positive
performance difference between both of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these guys are not that drastic and the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
x1 nano is already getting you 90 to 95,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
percent there i didnt find like i was,0.0,0.297,0.703,-0.2755,Negative
missing much when i was using the x1,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.296,Negative
nano like i didnt find like i needed to,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.6124,Positive
go back to the carbon and if youre an,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it administrator whos going from,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
office or to office or will be in the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
near future,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then i think youre going to have a lot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more fun with the nano because most,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.5563,Positive
people buying these business laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyre not like doing 3d work and,0.0,0.26,0.74,-0.2755,Negative
compiling code for 10 hours straight,0.275,0.0,0.725,0.2263,Positive
theyre using excel theyre writing,0.429,0.0,0.571,0.4588,Positive
documents theyre remoting into their,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
companys infrastructure to manage it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and i think with the better battery life,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
on the nano you might find this to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the better option now if youre,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
interested in picking any of these guys,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
up therell be links to it in the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the next one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
This is the coolest laptop Ive ever used,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Sadly its also one of the most disappointing,0.0,0.512,0.488,-0.7425,Negative
upbeat music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Lets review,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The last time you saw the Lenovo X1 Fold on this channel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I used it to explore all the ways a folding screen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
changed the way I used a laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Now that term laptop is important because,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2023,Positive
some folks have called this a tablet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and sure it can be used that way,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
But at 22 pounds its really too clunky for that label,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Where this machine finds full expression,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is when you treat it like a PC,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
With a built in kickstand it deploys to a 133 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
easel with detached keyboard on a desktop,0.191,0.221,0.588,-0.0516,Negative
collapses to a kind of cyber throwback Netbook for travel,0.0,0.216,0.784,-0.296,Negative
and finally folds into the footprint of a hardback novel,0.223,0.0,0.777,0.3182,Positive
when you need to pack it away,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Now because of that novel nature of folding screens,0.223,0.0,0.777,0.3182,Positive
you might think that the problems Id found,0.0,0.278,0.722,-0.4019,Negative
arise from that flexibility,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.34,Positive
But not at all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
In fact Lenovos hardware is frankly inspired,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
In the almost two year run up to its release,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the company was incredibly open to sharing,0.338,0.0,0.662,0.4703,Positive
how much work went into building a machine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that earns its Thinkpad name,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Thats the companys business brand of laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
generally held to a higher standard of reliability,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because theyre aimed at the enterprise,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
One of my favorite things from CES 2020,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.4588,Positive
was Lenovo having brought an exploded model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the X1 Fold for the press to poke and prod,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which we certainly did,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.34,Positive
Ive twisted the hinges Ive stabbed the screen,0.0,0.293,0.707,-0.4404,Negative
and by now Ive used the assembled device,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on and off for about two months,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I wasnt sure anyone could realize the dream,0.223,0.219,0.558,0.0098,Neutral
of a folding screen PC solid enough to stand up,0.167,0.0,0.833,0.1531,Positive
to everyday use but the X1 Fold does it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The leather back evokes the premium feel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of an old journal while the stacked Netbook mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
means you can still work under cramped conditions,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And over the two months Ive used it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres been none of the loosening or creaking,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or creasing you might expect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The only hardware quibbles I do have are the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Chassis being a little more reluctant to fold fully flat,0.0,0.201,0.799,-0.2534,Negative
resulting in a very slight angle when open,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and an oil slicklike reflectivity of the screen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
under certain lighting when powered off,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
Incidentally Ive seen both of those characteristics,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the Motorola Razor as well,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
so maybe these are just typical attributes of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whatever flexible screen LG display provided here,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
Those characteristics dont materially affect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
everyday use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im more annoyed by the thin tinny speakers,0.0,0.292,0.708,-0.4391,Negative
than I am anything to do with the folding screen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But while the foldable form factor may not be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the root of the machines problems,0.0,0.351,0.649,-0.4019,Negative
those problems do start with a byproduct,0.0,0.351,0.649,-0.4019,Negative
of its foldable nature,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
See in order to offer full functionality,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and its various postures,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the X1 Fold needs a detachable keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
On paper its quite clever,0.452,0.0,0.548,0.5095,Positive
Has a Bluetooth keyboard it works whether,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its attached or not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
When it does attach it does so magnetically,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and it even charges while its on there,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2732,Negative
fitting perfectly inside the gap between,0.457,0.0,0.543,0.6369,Positive
the screens halves,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I even got used to the compromises that were made,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in the name of miniaturization,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The enter key that I hit instead of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
apostrophe a hundred times,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the fact that typing a question mark means holding down,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not just the function key but the function,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the shift keys,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But I never got used to every 30th word,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sprouting extra letters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
A problem that to be fair Ive experienced on,0.209,0.245,0.545,-0.1027,Negative
other Bluetooth keyboards going all the way back,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to the Pixel C,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Look at this every double letter you see here is genuine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I didnt force any errors for effect,0.289,0.0,0.711,0.2584,Positive
Its not a problem with the keyboard itself,0.273,0.0,0.727,0.3089,Positive
since the doubling kept right on happening,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
even when I paired this thing with the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quirky writer I keep around for when I want,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
no one to take me seriously at the coffee shop,0.0,0.328,0.672,-0.4404,Negative
And I did have better luck when I stuck to netbook mode,0.396,0.134,0.47,0.5994,Positive
with the keyboard resting right on the device,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But that bundled keyboard has other problems,0.0,0.372,0.628,-0.5499,Negative
A terrible tiny track pad thats finicky,0.0,0.383,0.617,-0.4767,Negative
and prone to cursor drift,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
There are no rubber feet on the keyboard,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
so it wanders all over the place if you type on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a slippery table top,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.2023,Positive
Whatever material the keys are made of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its so soft that it starts showing wear,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
after just two days of use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And to top it all off theres no back light,0.15,0.183,0.667,-0.1027,Negative
so if youre trying to type in a darkened plane,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or train cabin good luck with that,0.541,0.0,0.459,0.7096,Positive
When I put all these problems to Lenovo,0.0,0.31,0.69,-0.4019,Negative
the company sent me a replacement for the retail device,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I had purchased which I really appreciated,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.5563,Positive
Sadly though that swap didnt fix any of my problems,0.0,0.407,0.593,-0.6705,Negative
and in fact it brought to light a whole new set of them,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
When I tried resetting the first machine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that reset failed and without a physical keyboard,0.0,0.355,0.645,-0.5106,Negative
I couldnt resolve the issue,0.0,0.421,0.579,-0.2924,Negative
Then a few weeks after I first set it up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I powered up the replacement X1 Fold,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to find that it had forgotten the date and time,0.0,0.174,0.826,-0.2263,Negative
Now I was able to fix that in the bios,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but then the device put itself into what looked like,0.265,0.0,0.735,0.5023,Positive
some kind of update loop which lasted until,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the battery ran out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Only after an overnight charge and an automated,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Windows repair did it start working again kinda,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Now if youre thinking hey you know,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this just doesnt seem like a device thats a great match,0.31,0.16,0.53,0.457,Positive
for Windows 10 you know I think youre onto something,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
This isnt a secret,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
From the very first time I saw the X1 Fold Prototype,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it was clear that it was not built for any version,0.206,0.0,0.794,0.3818,Positive
of Windows that we had yet seen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The Windows 10 operating system is not planned,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for the final product,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But rather for the sleeker Chrome OS competitor,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that came to be called Windows 10X,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
10X was intended to serve as the launch platform,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for Microsofts new Surface Neo device,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but when 10X got delayed the Neo did too,0.0,0.227,0.773,-0.3291,Negative
Not so for Lenovo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The X1 Fold launched almost on time at the tail end of 2020,0.111,0.0,0.889,0.128,Positive
with Windows 10 Home and Pro instead of X as options,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And the result well buzzer,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.2732,Positive
Thats what happens when the Spotify web player,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and X1 Fold decide to disagree about whether or not,0.0,0.224,0.776,-0.3818,Negative
the device should go to sleep,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And thats just the start of it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
A few times a week Ill wake up the machine,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.4215,Negative
to find that it thinks its in landscape or portrait mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when its really just the opposite,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Thats part of why Lenovo made its own mode switcher,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to help you switch orientations,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
but it doesnt always work,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so you need to restart sometimes to get it oriented right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
At one point while wroting this revie the lay board,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just stopped wrpling because Bluetooth stopped wrpling,0.0,0.432,0.568,-0.4215,Negative
Which meant I had to switch over to the builtin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Windows software lay board and its inconsistent autocorrect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The other limitations arent really bugs,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so much as symptoms of a system design thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very specific,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
While its responsive enough for typical browsing,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
and office tasks this Lakefield Core i5 cpu,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt pack any of the newer niceties,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
Intel included with its Evo line,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Like the rapid wakeup and better battery management,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.6597,Positive
I talked about on my Asus Zenbook Duo 14 review,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
That platform or maybe even Qualcomms,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Always Connected PC Snapdragon wouldve been,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a perfect fit for a device like this,0.744,0.0,0.256,0.8271,Positive
As it stands now the X1 Fold is often slow to wake,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and if Im using it in easel mode with the full screen,0.106,0.0,0.894,0.0772,Positive
I generally get fewer than four hours of constant use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on a full charge,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Judging from other reviews battery tests,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it seems I would get better endurance,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
if I didnt have to run the screen at max brightness,0.224,0.0,0.776,0.3818,Positive
almost all the time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But its top line output of 300 nits just isnt,0.196,0.0,0.804,0.296,Positive
bright enough for a machine thats supposed to come with me,0.244,0.0,0.756,0.4404,Positive
everywhere I go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And I want to take the X1 Fold everywhere I go,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
I was the kid who watched way too much Inspector Gadget,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

YouTubes biggest champion of folding screen technology,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5994,Positive

one you can even use a pen on without damaging it,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.4023,Positive
its otherworldly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I know I glossed over tablet mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but if youre an artist or a designer with a good use,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.5927,Positive
for this Wacom enabled stylus this would be next level,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Factor in the revival of cyber punks style,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that makes this kinda retro look cool again,0.225,0.0,0.775,0.2585,Positive
this thing could be incredible,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Unfortunately for a starting price this high,0.0,0.324,0.676,-0.34,Negative
and a bug list this long,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the only thing incredible about it is how badly its been,0.0,0.237,0.763,-0.4767,Negative
hobbled by shipping with a half baked,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and badly implemented form of the wrong OS,0.0,0.508,0.492,-0.7351,Negative

If it ever gets a build of Windows 10X,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Ill be first in line to reevaluate,0.0,0.318,0.682,-0.4215,Negative
but until then I cant recommend it,0.0,0.348,0.652,-0.395,Negative
And given the caliber of this hardware,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the potential of the concept,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats something Im genuinely sad to say,0.0,0.341,0.659,-0.4767,Negative

still important uh usb type a port and a,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2023,Positive
kensington lock,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
build quality on this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is excellent just as it was with the,0.346,0.0,0.654,0.5719,Positive
previous generation its going to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really difficult to,0.0,0.583,0.417,-0.4201,Negative
i think beat the overall aesthetic the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whole package the cpu,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
again overall performance that will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
likely,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not yield amazing battery life but lets,0.0,0.253,0.747,-0.2584,Negative
see you know if this gets between 8 and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
10 hours i dont think that thats bad,0.0,0.368,0.632,-0.5423,Negative
the oled display option uh besides the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cpu itself i think is one of the most,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
important new elements to this machine,0.265,0.0,0.735,0.2023,Positive
now this is a 16 by 10 aspect ratio ips,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
panel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and again full hd plus that means,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
by 1200 res but you can spec this out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with a 22 k oled option this does,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
promise,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3182,Positive
very good color fidelity and from what i,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
can see right now it looks really good,0.313,0.0,0.687,0.4927,Positive
but the question will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know how does that oled perform in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all likelihood its going to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
excellent,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5719,Positive
so thats something to be aware of and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of course this does carry intel evo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
certification um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the processor is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i believe that its a v pro certified so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i just you know a lot of nice things,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
going on here your classic,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thinkpad keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youve got the nub in the event you need,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it youve got of course,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a standard i would say pretty much,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.4939,Positive
standard thinkpad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
trackpad and then you still have of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
course the good old left and right click,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
for when youre using the nub or even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for those of you who just dont want to,0.0,0.133,0.867,-0.0572,Negative
use the trackpad to actually make,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
selections youve got flexibility now,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.34,Positive
you can also,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get 5g or 4g radios on this so thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
another thing when customization comes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
down to it but just remember youre,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to want to flex this thing on ram,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
because of it being soldered the nvme,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
drive you can upgrade yourself uh for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
those of you that are wondering i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
believe this came with a one terabyte,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
again gen 4 drive but ill be testing it,0.0,0.346,0.654,-0.5719,Negative
out putting it through the paces lets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just go ahead and jump on the internet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for a second,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and just see what thats like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know having touchscreen on something,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this size and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh the fact that it does go 180 degrees,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is going to be a popular machine,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
just like the previous generation,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
especially now with that more powerful,0.382,0.0,0.618,0.4754,Positive
processor can they ever get it to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more efficient i dont know but its,0.29,0.0,0.71,0.2609,Positive
definitely more powerful anyone who,0.659,0.0,0.341,0.6997,Positive
tells you otherwise well,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.2732,Positive
they havent played with the 1260p so,0.0,0.253,0.747,-0.2584,Negative
getting onto wifi here as i said lets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
do that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
jumping on right now i also like all of,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
the keys that we have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the dedicated keys at the top always a,0.49,0.0,0.51,0.5859,Positive
nice touch not everybody loves it but i,0.214,0.225,0.562,-0.0256,Neutral
am a fan,0.697,0.0,0.303,0.3182,Positive
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i think its the whole balance of all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the parts here that makes this such an,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
attractive machine because it has a,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
great keyboard it has a good trackpad,0.636,0.0,0.364,0.7906,Positive
has a really nice display especially now,0.382,0.0,0.618,0.4754,Positive
with that oled option youve got the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
upgraded webcam faster now lp ddr5 ram,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
faster nvme uh gen 4 drive so it pretty,0.332,0.0,0.668,0.539,Positive
much i think checks all the boxes for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what you would want out of an ultrabook,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
especially if like me you really have,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.4173,Positive
been waiting for that oled option so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were just gonna,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
open it up here and lets just see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were gonna start without data,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so lets go ahead and move forward,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know they just took over the world,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just to jump to a site quickly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um i will take you over to youtube and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lets just take a look at a little bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of what the video performance is like on,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
this display which i believe tops out at,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.5106,Positive
roughly 400 nits of brightness,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.3818,Positive
well go ahead and take a little 4k hdr,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
sample clip,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and lets just this is always a good,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
benchmark,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
especially since its designed for oled,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and youre hearing the speakers too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
winwin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brightness lets talk about that,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.3818,Positive
were at full brightness right now,0.342,0.0,0.658,0.3818,Positive
speakers are right here if that wasnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
already obvious on the side of the deck,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
my mistake there lets get audio all the,0.0,0.255,0.745,-0.34,Negative
way up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so i think it looks really good it,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
sounds good and then this thing weighs,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
two and a half pounds has a solid,0.242,0.0,0.758,0.1531,Positive
processor,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
again it pretty much checks every box,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
especially if youre like me and you,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.4144,Positive
still want to have touch screen and the,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
fact that its matte not high reflective,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is a godsend now in terms of other,0.388,0.0,0.612,0.5859,Positive
things wifi 6e thats another upgrade,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
over the previous generation i didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mention before that is soldered to the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
board,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh but no worries i dont think anyone,0.0,0.565,0.435,-0.7579,Negative
was really expecting it not to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
soldered to the board in a machine like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
this again under two and a half pounds i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
think its technically 248 forgive me,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
lenovo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but yeah just a really nice machine,0.634,0.0,0.366,0.7869,Positive
this is going to be probably very easy,0.313,0.0,0.687,0.4927,Positive
to recommend to anyone looking for a,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
lightweight ultrabook with pretty much,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.4939,Positive
everything under the sun,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
battery life may be the only drawback,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but lets test it out and see i mean,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right now from lenovo its got a full,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
charge so as soon as this video ends im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to start to get an idea of what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
battery life is really like and just so,0.285,0.0,0.715,0.4201,Positive
you know,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ill take brightness all the way down,0.25,0.269,0.481,-0.0516,Negative
right now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty interesting now it is going to be,0.496,0.0,0.504,0.7096,Positive
all about you know the display in my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
opinion because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if you went ahead and got the oled,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
version of this clearly youre going to,0.342,0.0,0.658,0.481,Positive
be working with something thats more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
power hungry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with this display being that hd plus you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cant even see it which shows the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brightness level on here is good enough,0.524,0.0,0.476,0.6705,Positive
but now you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
1920x1200 is more than enough for the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
majority of users,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and its going to be the most,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
budgetfriendly and again battery life,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
should be the best with this model so in,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.6369,Positive
all likelihood this will end up being,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the most popular model but again,0.29,0.0,0.71,0.2609,Positive
that oled display i think sets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lightweight ultrabook apart from much of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the competition and its been tested to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
military spec so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
durable carbon fiber body you know no,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.296,Negative
card reader but i dont i dont fault,0.0,0.324,0.676,-0.3392,Negative
them for that this is just a really well,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.3384,Positive
put together machine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
should be easy to disassemble also,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
so not that theres a lot to do in there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
other than,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
replace that nvme drive if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
desire so again noting carbon fiber and,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
magnesium build here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its just a really slick ultrabook and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
again probably one of the easier ones to,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
recommend you got your little,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
lenovo thinkpad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

x1 yoga gen 7 intel 12th gen processors,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and when i saw this thing i was like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
cool it looks like the previous one a,0.49,0.0,0.51,0.5859,Positive
very attractive laptop but the one thing,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2724,Positive
that i was truly hoping for was the same,0.487,0.0,0.513,0.6908,Positive
design treatment that the yoga 9i got if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you guys dont remember in that review,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they changed the design to round out the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
edges not only did this physically look,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better but it also feels better it just,0.492,0.0,0.508,0.7003,Positive
feels a lot more comfortable to hold in,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.5563,Positive
the hand not that this is terrible to,0.26,0.252,0.488,0.0258,Neutral
hold or anything but these edges are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sharp and it just doesnt have that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
refinement theres tons of i o so on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
left hand side you have two thunderbolt,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
4 ports they both support power delivery,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
you have a usb a port hdmi this is 20 b,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then on the right hand side you have,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4939,Positive
another usb port and then an audio jack,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its still a very light laptop its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
about three pounds and of course this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
being a convertible you can put it in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
different positions you can put it all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the way back flat like this you can put,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
it in tent mode which by the way i would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like to know how many people actually,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
use tent mode just out of curiosity let,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
me know because i figure when i watch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
content i just kind of leave it in the,0.0,0.176,0.824,-0.1263,Negative
laptop position like most normal people,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
do but the big deal is you can flip it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all the way around like this into a,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
tablet mode and then you can pull out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the included pen and start sketching on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the display the experience of the pen is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very similar to the previous one it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
writes very well obviously this is a,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.3384,Positive
smaller pen its not the best for long,0.0,0.325,0.675,-0.5216,Negative
hours of drawing but to sketch down,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
notes or to make quick drawings its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more than adequate now we have to have a,0.237,0.0,0.763,0.2911,Positive
conversation about the track point,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
otherwise known as the nipple as you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
guys know ive touched tons of nipples i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
touch nipples all the time and im at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the point now where i dont want to,0.0,0.169,0.831,-0.0572,Negative
touch them anymore not because i dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like touching them they feel good its,0.519,0.0,0.481,0.6597,Positive
just that its no longer needed you know,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
there was a time in a place where the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
track point was superior i get it it,0.368,0.0,0.632,0.5423,Positive
used to be an iconic feature with the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ibm brand lenovo bought it from them but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
today the regular touchpad is so much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better its more accurate its its,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
easier to use and having the nipple,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
there takes up real estate this stuff,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
over here is eating into potential,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
touchpad space and touchpads today are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
meant to be big and having that extra,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
space makes it a lot easier to use now,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
the keyboard if youve ever used a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thinkpad keyboard you know is excellent,0.425,0.0,0.575,0.5719,Positive
the tactile typing experience is great,0.451,0.0,0.549,0.6249,Positive
it just feels so good to type on of,0.319,0.0,0.681,0.5777,Positive
course you have backlighting so you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
see in the dark but you also have these,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
unified keys at the top that give you,0.423,0.0,0.577,0.5267,Positive
quick access to certain settings you,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive

like i said collaboration is,0.455,0.0,0.545,0.3612,Positive
very critical,0.0,0.722,0.278,-0.3804,Negative

cameras which do take up more space than,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that 720p hd camera,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so were able to put in what we call the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
communications bar which is going to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
able to have that fhd camera without,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

that harmful spectrum of light without,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
changing color accuracy,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

oled is great because it provides really,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.6249,Positive
vivid visuals and its been a really hot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
request from customers all over the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

computer vision technology and thats,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.25,Positive
basically going to analyze metadata from,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

functionalities and then theres also,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whats called attention tracking and if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre um looking at your display you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have it on full brightness probably and,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
then lets say you have somebody come up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and talk to you off to the side so your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
attention is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
off of your display youre looking,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

straight,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.2263,Positive
um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so lets take a look at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um x1 carbon,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
here i have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
taken apart,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the bottom cover of an x1 carbon and i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
had mentioned,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a little bit about performance already,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how weve increased the performance,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
of these pretty significantly gen to gen,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
so we one of the ways we were able to do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that was with this air intake keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
design so here you have the planer board,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the dual fan system,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
now underneath here we have implemented,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this air intake keyboard which is going,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to be able to take air in from the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and be able to disperse it into this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dual fan system,0.535,0.0,0.465,0.3182,Positive
to then expel that hot air thats,0.0,0.326,0.674,-0.4404,Negative
generated out the um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
back of the system,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so this is really going to be able to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
help us,0.73,0.0,0.27,0.4019,Positive
get that highest performance out of that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
p series,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cpu from intel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and whats actually really cool about,0.341,0.0,0.659,0.3804,Positive
this and maybe my favorite part is that,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.4588,Positive
we were able to maintain the spill,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
resistance of the keyboard so if you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ever have accidents and maybe spill a,0.0,0.315,0.685,-0.3182,Negative
little bit of water or coffee on on your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop that should still work,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the biggest improvement that weve done,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.4588,Positive
for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
our x1 series in terms of performance is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
definitely around our nano so,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
the first generation of x1 nano we came,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
out with last year and that had the up4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
intel cpu,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and this year we really cranked it up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
two notches so now were offering p28,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
up to 32 gigs of memory and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can see um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we really had to do a lot here because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the the size of the x1 nano is its so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
much more compact its less than a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kilogram its 14 millimeters thin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we um we really had to tweak our,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thermals a lot to really be able to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that same level of performance out of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
our x1 nano that we do have on our x1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
carbon and yoga,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so what if you could have a 16inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
touch display that was also a computer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you could pack up to carry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but that could also convert to a 12inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop but that was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also durable enough to gain milspec,0.405,0.0,0.595,0.5267,Positive

this is not that computer i mean if you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
remember michael fisher did all he could,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to love it but could not but it was,0.245,0.0,0.755,0.3818,Positive
mainly because at the time it was pretty,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
experimental,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this years x1 fold is a completely,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

dive into our handson,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Applause,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4215,Positive
so lets get a few obvious things out of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the way yes this new thinkpad x1 fold is,0.252,0.0,0.748,0.4019,Positive
a complete redesign from what we had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
before,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this baby is not trying to be a tablet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one bit to envision it correctly think,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more of the fact that it has thinkpad in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the name and consider it more of a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop that can become something else so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yeah instead of the extended 13inch,0.306,0.0,0.694,0.296,Positive
display think larger now with a panel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that goes all the way to 163 inches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
instead of the chunky build from the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
past thing thinner and more refined than,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
before,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
instead of just some weird netbook when,0.0,0.221,0.779,-0.1779,Negative
folded now were talking about a 12inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
equivalent instead making this feel more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a real notebook computer surely we,0.574,0.0,0.426,0.6597,Positive
do lose the kickstand that was built in,0.0,0.278,0.722,-0.4019,Negative
but im actually not going to complain,0.308,0.0,0.692,0.395,Positive
because this feels so much easier to,0.339,0.0,0.661,0.4728,Positive
carry from one room to the next lenovo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually made it more modular on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
inside the textured back can be removed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for you to replace the ssd for more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
storage and even the option to get a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
larger battery making it pretty crazy,0.333,0.25,0.417,0.2023,Positive
that they were able to make this device,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thinner but without affecting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
serviceability obviously that means its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not water resistant but its milspec,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
810g certified so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i wouldnt worry too much about dropping,0.325,0.0,0.675,0.3412,Positive
it in the field but just keep your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
coffee in the cup and youll be fine now,0.184,0.0,0.816,0.2023,Positive
while extended this new sharp panel is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now of 25 k resolution and double the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brightness at 600 nits making the,0.342,0.0,0.658,0.3818,Positive
experience pretty crisp detailed and,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.4939,Positive
more versatile for outdoor use lenovo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now provides a stand thats easy to,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
collapse and carry but which i think you,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.2732,Negative
might just want to leave in one place,0.153,0.141,0.706,0.0258,Neutral
for you to prop the device up and use in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
either portrait or landscape orientation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
depending on your needs for the day the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cramped bluetooth keyboard from before,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is now gone in favor of a true thinkpad,0.478,0.0,0.522,0.6705,Positive
nano size keyboard that can magnetically,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
attach to the stand and help you get,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
work done as if this were some sort of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
large desktop the trackpad is now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
finally of a decent size and you even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get a touch point making this more of a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
product youll want to use for prolonged,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
periods of time this panel also includes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
full wacom digitizer support making the,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
pen not just any typical stylus the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
screen is strong enough to truly support,0.69,0.0,0.31,0.836,Positive
anyones desire to get fully artistic on,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
a much larger canvas though if youre,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wondering if this is glass its more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like plastic obviously the claim to fame,0.519,0.0,0.481,0.6597,Positive
for the computer is the fact that it can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fold so once you remove it from the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
stand you can then fold it into a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
smaller form factor thats more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
reminiscent to apples old 12inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook and where the keyboard now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
attaches to the bottom portion for this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to be a regular laptop now since the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fold flat hinge was completely,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
redesigned you wont really be able to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
carry the keyboard within as you could,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
before but ill forgive it given how,0.233,0.326,0.441,-0.2617,Negative
compact it becomes when closed which,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
takes advantage of a bellshaped design,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.25,Positive
when folded to spare you from a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pronounced crease other perks include a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better placement for the ir webcam which,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
provides windows hello functionality in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all orientations you have three usbc,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ports out of which two support,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
thunderbolt 4 so theres one or two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
available no matter how you place it,0.133,0.265,0.602,-0.2732,Negative
heck theres even a third speaker built,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in so that stereo audio is available on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all modes and addressing one of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
biggest pain points of its predecessor,0.0,0.398,0.602,-0.5106,Negative
now as for internals were talking,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
intels 12th generation u9 core i9,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
processor up to 12 gigs of ram one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
terabyte of storage intel iris xc,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
graphics the latest wifi bluetooth and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
even 5g support which comes optional the,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
battery might not be the largest but it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can rapid charge and again you do have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the option to replace it last but not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
least we have windows 11 which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
clearly better designed for a product,0.651,0.0,0.349,0.6808,Positive
like this than windows 10 was,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
this allows for snapping in a far more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seamless way and for the short time i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
use this prototype i can tell you it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fits like a glove this new thinkpad is,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
