I added this to my daily routine after a bad autoimmune flare from too much sun and my doctor making it clear to me that a broad spectrum sunscreen must be a part of my daily routine.  I read the reviews here and saw that some said this left a cast and some said that it cleared after the product was absorbed.  I thought to myself even if it did leave a slight cast, it would be okay as I am really fair skinned (actually I am pretty pale).  Just as some background, I wear very little makeup, usually just a CC Cream for "foundation".This product works in providing great sun protection that does not irritate my sensitive skin and does not clog my pores.  However, the cast does NOT go away for me once it is absorbed, so I can only imagine how it is for those with darker skin than mine.  I tried using my normal CC cream over it and that just made it an even weirder cast.  I am going to try the tinted one but until it arrives, I will resemble Casper.
I used this on my face and neck in Florida…did not burn when applied in morning and outside all day.  Did not have any reaction with my sensitive skin but did have a white sheen.
Apparently mineral sunscreen tends to leave a white film on your face (this has been my experience).  I would NOT use this for professional use since there is a light white film.  It seems to work well for pool/beach time and being in and out of the water.  I still wear a hat and sunglasses, but I'm a kayaker and as I'm in and out of the bay to practice kayaking skills (usually without a hat and glasses), it seems to protect well.  I love the Cerave daily moisturizer 30 SPF.  The daily moisturizer does NOT leave a residue.
The sunscreen is good but it leaves a white cast on my face Thats very noticiable.
I like the light tint and it seems to be a very good sunscreen.  Suggested by my dermatologist.  It is a little heavy to wash off at the end of the day. But I usually have reapplied sunscreen by then as well.  I also use the Sara the moisturizer with number 30 sunscreen which is clear. Or just apply a little moisturizer before I use the tinted sunscreen. Lots of flexibility depending what I’m doing on any day, and effective attractive  sunscreen.
I use this sunscreen kitesurfing in Mexico. It does not wash off and I do not burn. Regular sunscreen is removed by the waves and spray. Also, unlike the chemical sunscreens, I do not taste this sunscreen after application. I still use both types, but if I expect to be on the water a long time this mineral based sunscreen provides the best protection.
I have hyperpigmentation on my skin and I wanted something that would protect my face and reduce the red spots I alreday have on my face. I bought this product and so far I am seeing a pretty big differnce. Slowly but surely I am seeing that my hyperpigmentaion is fading while reducing new acne that shows up. I do have to note that the sunscreen casts a pretty pale shade on my face. My skin tone is light and evn though I apply small drops of the suncreen, my skin turns very white/purple. That is the only downside I have. But so far it protects my skin and does the job.
Feels thicker but hydrating and protective. It leaves a really, really white cast
Product is thick and hard to spread. Leaves a thick white cast.
A bit too oily
I'm a caramel brown black woman with oily skin and I got the suite of cerave products including the SPF 50 to reduce my darkspots. Yes it has a white cast (almost no matter the amt used) However ***TIP *** I mix mine with either concealer or foundation to tint it prior to applying to my face, and also another layer of Cerave SPF 30 (which does NOT have a white cast, and is also not mineral based). From there the white cast is not a problem. It looks natural in photos and under makeup. The most important thing to me is protection to prevent hyperpigmentation and I've been using about 3 wks. This line of products has helped more than anything else so far esp with the dark spots from shaving the little hairs at the corner of my chin.  **Takeaway** I know ppl of color can be wary about sunscreen but make it work for you!
It's a pretty good sunscreen, it doesn't stink which is a relief, but it does leave a heavy white cast. It can be reduced by rubbing the sunscreen between your hands for a few seconds, and it isn't really an issue for me because I'm very pale to begin with, but may be for others.
This product has some mixed reviews and this one also is mixed. Great proven protection from a very well respected company. If you use too much it is difficult to spread and gives a whits tone. The secret is to apply lightly and rub well into the skin. Then reapply a like amount and spread again.
This sun screen really works great but the only thing that I didn’t like is that is leaves a bad white cast on darker skin tones
Exactly what I needed for when in the sun, especially with my sensitive skin. With most sunscreens I breakout, but not with this one!Love how light it goes on and lasts so long. Great coverage!
Holy white cast! I applied it on my face first and I was mortified. The cast did not dissipate. I had to wipe it off. This is a very thick and sticky consistency. The only time I can wear this is probably at the beach. But not for daily under the makeup unless you want to look like Casper the ghost!
As a sunscreen, this product works. I did not get sunburned when I was wearing it despite being in full sun. That is the only positive.This sunscreen is difficult to apply and left a visible white cast on my already pale skin. The worst part is that the lotion stays sticky and doesn’t ever feel like it sinks in or dries. I could not stand the stickiness and won’t be using the rest of the bottle.
Worked well for protection and didn't cause me to break out, however, it does not blend in at all so my face was covered in white.
If you happen to not be quite white,  you may see a white sheen on your skin. Trust me,  it doesn't absorb and go away.  The actual texture of the texture of the sunscreen is nice and not too sticky.  I'm sure the sunscreen is itself good quality,  but I took it off before even going outside because I looked a bit sickly.
I love CeraVe products and really wanted to love this facial sunscreen. I have dry skin and this is thick and made my skin even drier.  Perhaps it will work on others, it just didn’t work for me. I will keep and use it, just not on my face.
I’ve used many cerve products. This sunscreen has titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in it. Titanium dioxide normally does not work on dark skin. It will either have a gray cast … In this situation … it’s blue. So, for a sunscreen - I say go for it. But if you’re leaving your home to go somewhere important … that would not be the day to use this. If you’re going to lay out on your patio or balcony then, sure. But, not to go to a store and run errands.
Was recommended by my dermatologist for facial sun exposure with roseacea. Works great. Much less redness after sun exposure. My only complaint would be that it doesn't blend all that well and leaves a bit of a white film. Not enough for me to stop using it though.
I was tired of spending $40 on other facial sunscreens, so decided to give this a try. Yes, it does the job and provides solid protection from the sun. BUT, and this is a deal-breaker for me, it takes forever to absorb into your face. I like to put sunscreen on under my foundation every day (I live in Phoenix and being in the sun is often unavoidable), and even a "normal" dose of this makes your face completely white and ghost-like for hours. So I won't be purchasing again. I think this product is better served for people hanging out by the pool. I wouldn't call this a daily sunscreen.
It honestly not that good for cerave products, one it stinks like chemicals but it smells a lot like thread locker to me, the sunscreen is thicccccc and hard to blend out but other then that it’s good lol
This is a good product for it for my husband and dad, they ended up not using them because the crème used sooo visible and does not absorb.
When using it it is very flakey and difficult to rub into the skin. I always look super pale and  it isn't just me not rubbing it in well. Idk why it has that weird consistency but it does and it sucks
First of all it's really hard to produce an spf50 sunscreen that does not leave any white cast...I would not recommend this sunscreen for darker shades unless you want to look like Mark Zuckerberg surfing in Hawaii... Even applying a pea sized amount of sunscreen will leave a very noticeable white cast. The CeraVe spf 30 is much better for darker skin tones if you really work it in. However, if you have pale skin like me, their spf 50 really isn't too bad. Taking this into account I want to point out the positives of this sunscreen.1. It does not have that think sunscreen smell. It doesn't have any smell, which is nice. I wear sunscreen everyday of the year and it is nice to have one that does not have me smelling like a pool.2. It blends in fairly nicely when your face is moisturized. When I first started putting on this sunscreen, I was disappointed because I have very pale skin with rosacea on my cheeks. Even with my pale skin, the white cast was noticeable for the rest of the day. However, I noticed that if my face is moisturized or even a little greasy before application. It will not leave a horrible white cast.3. It soothed my rosacea. My face is pretty much red all the time and looks irritated after a workout. However, after a few weeks of using this sunscreen, I noticed that my rosacea is pretty calm at the end of the day. This only happens when I wear this sunscreen. I am not sure if it is because of the niacinamide in this sunscreen, but that was a nice surprise.
A little of product goes a long way because it leaves a white cast on skin that is hard to spread out. Its thick when applying but it doesn’t feel like it on the face. Theres no sunscreen smell to it!

I have been using this product for my face for several years. This is the one that has worked best for me, giving me protection when no other product has.I see reviews that say it gives a white cast and is hard to spread.I use a tiny bit of moisturizer first, and before it dries I apply the Cerave.That helps it to spread easily and absorb completely-no white cast for me.If you have dark skin you may wish to avoid products with zinc oxide.
This product works really well and spreads super easily. I like the feeling of it on and it doesn't have any oily after residue. My only complaint is that the white tint is pretty bad on this one. It takes a while to get it in your skin enough to even leave the house.
CeraVe is a great brand, contains good ingredients but leaves a white cast on your skin.
The protection and the moisturizer
Putting sunscreen on was never a normal part of my skincare routine until recently. I tried a few primers with sunscreen and they would give little to no protection and wore off quickly. I absolutely love this product. I haven’t had a sunburn on my face all summer.
Love it
I like it  I'm  using every  also my skin look  flawless..
Works nice and removed my acne scars. Has white residue after applying.
Unfortunately leaves a white cast on my face, I'll probably only use it for beach.It doesn't leave any white cast on neck and other areas.
All the chemical sunscreens seem to irritate my eyes.  The zinc ones don't.  This product is not that thick but it doesn't fully disappear no matter how much you work it in.  There is a white sheen to my face.  I also feel it doesn't really dry with a dewy feel to the skin instead of dry.  I'll continue to use this until I find something better.
Goes on easily for great coverage.
I have a very sensitive skin and surfing in the Californian sun is pretty brutal.Despite spreading the sunscreen a lot and regularly, I got sunburnt.Would not recommend for water and extreme conditions.However the screen did not create any dermatological issues.
I'm sure it provides good protection, but it was impossible to spread it nicely on my face... I always just ended up looking like I had a thick layer of white stuff on my face. I guess that's fine for going to the beach but not really acceptable for life in the city. I much prefer CeraveAM because it can be rubbed in reasonably-well and I don't end up looking like a ghost (though I guess it's not quite as protective as this product).
This was great except left my olive skin white. Had to send back.
For women of color.. you’ll appear ashy
Works GREAT for sun protection and if you have semi-sensitive skin it didn’t ever break me out or irritate my skin. Kinda hard to rub in/spread, and DEFINITELY leaves a white cast no matter how much you rub it in.
I have used other products from this brand before and have liked them a lot, however this was not great. This stuff is so thick that I have to thin it out with moisturizer, and even then it just sits on top of my skin making me look Gastly pale IF I managed to get all the lines out. In the future I would probably only wear this if I was going to then put makeup on top
Good sunscreen, however, it's not the easiest to spread and leaves white undertone.
This protected me from the sun, but I had to rub the sunscreen in for like 7 minutes because it left such a white cast on my face, I felt like I put on foundation for clown makeup
I got this because I wanted a sunblock to apply under my makeup. This was not it. Not only does it leave really bad white cast but it’s hard to spread and doesn’t sit well under foundation.
I had very high hopes for this as I love & use many CeraVe products. While this did a great job of protecting my face from the sun, it was extremely hard to spread & left a white film over my face. No matter how much I tried to rub it in, it still remained white & thick feeling.
I am naturally pale as a ghost, so this may be playing a part in it but I did have some white cast immediately after putting it on, but working it in and letting it set did the trick. My skin feels smooth and hydrated, not sticky at all and I love that there is no added scent.
There is no problem with this product.
Since this is a mineral sunscreen it does leave a white chalky effect on the face. The sunscreen does need to be applied or blended throughly, which takes a lot of time. But it does give a good protection.
I love Cerave products. And I was excited to buy this 50 spf sunblock for the face.  When I finally used it, I found that it was difficult to blend onto skin and it leaves an obvious white cast! It also clumps up on pores and black heads that is clearly visible to the naked eye. I don't think I'll purchase this again unfortunately.
I have been a big fan of CeraVe for a long time. I use their face wash daily and day creams for under eyes and face. I am not in the Sun much ~ but occasionally do go outside. This is wonderful as I do not sweat it off!
Not at all easy to spread or be absorbed.  Very white.
Does not blend in. Leaves skin tacky and glowing. Very disappointed.
This feels great on the skin and good for sun protection, but does not blend into the skin.  Leaves a heavy white cast which wouldn’t look pretty going out into public.  Not an everyday SPF to wear under makeup.
CeraVe is a great Zinc based sunscreen when you have to be outdoors a long time, otherwise it is too thick, too white and pore clogging.  I only use it if I'm going to be outside for long periods of time, it always clogs my pores where other sunscreens don't.
Works great protecting my skin from sun.  Just wont use on my face.  Looks like you dipped your face in flour when dry.
Moisturizing but leaves too much of a white cast on your face.
Even as a pasty ginger the white paint-like consistency was a difficult to manage. It doesn't spread well and hardly rubs in. Definitely not for days you want to look cute. But it works well.
This product is to heavy in the face
Perfect for my night skin and will last me forever! You only need at most a pea sized amount, I use about half of that.
I use this brands products for my face wash and face lotion, love CeraVe! This is my first time using the sunscreen and never again! It leaves the dreaded white cast that those with dark skin like to avoid. It’s also very drying so was hard to spread it out to try and reduce the cast. I have dry skin so because it’s no hydrating it’s made me feel itchy. If you have oily skin you’ll be fine though, makes you very matte!
It’s fine to use on your face if you don’t mind having to wear foundation directly on top of it to offset the intense white cast.
Great balm.  I think affordable.  A bit better quality and density over the Cetaphil balm.
I love CeraVe’s facial 30 spf because it doesn’t leave my skin with a white residue. In fact I love Most of their moisturizers. I wanted to give this product a try because I needed more coverage. It is very effective but it did leave a very white residue on my face and wouldn’t blend well with my makeup.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
I love most of their products but the sunscreen doesn’t rub all the way in to my face which is such a bummer. It definitely leaves a white cast on my face.
the white cast is kinda ridiculous but makeup covers it, great product
This is from a favorite company for facial moisturizers. I wanted a non chemical facial SPF to use daily without needing to put regular products on first and was hoping for an economical alternative to my favorite El** MD, but this is not sheer for the face. Oh well. I’ll use it on the back of my neck and arms!
I can't believe I paid $16 to look like a kabuki reject. Goes on difficult, leaves you looking like a corpse, hard to remove, and gave me a headache almost immediately. At least it doesn't smell. I'll try it again next time I work outside. Definitely for when you don't care what you look like but don't want skin cancer. Can't imagine wearing it with makeup. Might work under it but they insist you put it on last. Hilarious. I don't think it'll hold up under sweat. Maybe try a sweat band around the hairline.
leaves your face white
When you initially put it on, your face is white and doesnt really rub in.
I’m brow skin and when I applied even the smallest amount (that wouldn’t even give proper protection) there was a TERRIBLE white cast and after a while it feels really greasy. Cerave has a a moisturizing lotion with sunscreen it’s still a little greasy but there’s not white cast I like that one better
good protection, but your face turns white. good for exercise or outdoor activities. but not for everyday use as it is very white and thick
I got this sunscreen because I found my existing go-to daily sunscreen had avobenzone and other potentially harmful ingredients, and the ingredients in this are much better. But I'm lily white with a mild tan and this stuff looks like clown makeup on me. Does a horrible job blending into your skin, to the point that I'm not comfortable going out in public with it on unless I use makeup to try to restore a normal shade of color to my skin. Let a black friend try some too and it was so clearly just not made with them in mind. Don't recommend this as a daily sunscreen.
My dermatologist recommended this brand. Is a bit lighter and easier to spread than the body cream. I like that it has no smell and is not as thick as other sunscreens. Holds up well but reapply as per directions after swimming and after 2 hours. Their video on how to apply helps. Good product at reasonable price.
I love this product because it doesn't contain all those other harmful chemicals. I would give it a 5 star, BUT... [sigh] it just does not blend easily. I have to dab very small amounts around my face in order for it to blend, but it still doesn't spread well. This makes it so time consuming when I need a quick skin routine in the morning. Also, it leaves my skin with a white tint (again because it doesn't spread easily). I love the product, but its just so frustrating to work with...
Amazing products, I used elta md elements for years and this is apst identical for half the price. I worked in dermatology for 16 years so I know what's good and this by far is an amazing sunscreen
Really wanted to love this sunscreen because I’m huge cerave fan but it is really hard to apply, feels dry on skin and my face looks like a clown for hours, in order for my face not to look white I have to apply makeup and I dont wear makeup for work
Thick, white residue difficult to conceal
Love the product and the fast delivery.
As mentioned in other reviews, it leaves a white cast and has no safety sticker cover on the opening under the plastic cap. It blends really nicely and has a nice texture though.
Thick, white with pasty film that didn’t resolve quickly. I returned to search for another.
The product has a bad white cast if you apply more than a pea size at a time.
So hard to apply
This sunscreen offers great protection from the sun, but it is not good for everyday use. The formula leaves a terrible white cast on my skin. I am fair in skin color, but I can see white streaks across my face. In addition, it's very hard to spread. Once it touches the skin, the lotion turns "chalky" or "cakey" and can't be rubbed across the face without crumbling. I have been using this face sunscreen exclusively for running outside or going to the beach, but I am in search of a new everyday sunscreen to wear under make-up.
It’s sunscreen. Not lightweight. Big White cast. Hard to spread, very thick. But it protects from sun. I’ll be returning it as I need it for my face as it’s advertised and it’s too thick.
It's cheap for sure, but bad for your face. First it's not moisture at all, then it's very thick like toothpaste texture, 3rd it's not easy to spread out at all, 4th when you put on your face it make your face 2 color whiter.And I get my pore blocked a lot because of this sunscreen.Horrible face sunscreen, even it's cheap, don't waste your money.
Loved this product
I like that the spf rate is so high, but the lotion is thick and leaves a noticeable white cast on the skin, even at running it in thoroughly. Or if u miss a spot, you'll have a white blur on your skin and find out in some embarrassing moment. I'm naturally very tan so it is noticeable on me.
I have been using this sunscreen for years and was excited to see it offered on Amazon.To the reviewers who complain that it has an ashy cast, you must understand that zinc and titanium oxide are made from a white powder, so there is absolutely no way to make the sunscreen go on clear if you use any type of true mineral-based liquid sunscreen. The best way to try and blend this sunscreen as much as possible is to warm it in your hands and apply small amounts in sections on your face. It actually works best of you let your moisturizer sink in, put the sunscreen on and let it sit on your face for a few moments so it doesn't peel.The new dispenser is great, as it has a smaller opening so the sunscreen doesn't squeeze out a huge application. As an individual who has sensitive skin and wears sunscreen everyday, this product has been awesome at keeping my skin from breaking out and protecting it from the sun.
I love this sunscreen, and with fair skin that is easily prone to burning, I have to wear a serious sunscreen all the time. This does the trick. Some people may not like the fact that it isn't totally transparent and does show up as white on the skin. I don't mind and expect that from a mineral based sunscreen that truly blocks out the harmful rays. The most important thing for me is protection, and this product delivers.
I ordered this product, after I received a sample from my dermatologist.  Best protection product I've ever used.  There were some nagative reviews, because it goes on white, and a thick application may stay white.  However it depends on your individual needs.  I am fair skinned and in my late 50s, and just recently was diagnosed with Basel Cell Carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, on my nose and face.  I need a product for sun block and protection.  I want it caked on white and to stay white, for blockage (clear poduct on the best blockage) and does not easily sweat off, rub off, or lose its effectiveness.  So for me, somebody who needs to protect my face from harmful rays, here on out, and I am not too proud to cake it on, and have a slightly white nose, when I am doing yard work, playing golf, or other outside activites.  If you are concerned about appearance, then maybe not for you.  But if you are concerned about protecting your skin, although may not look attractive, this prouduct may be for you.  I have yet to have a burn on my face, with proper application.  Wished they had this 20 years ago.
I am a fan of Cerave, just not of this mineral sunscreen.  If you put it on dry or ashy skin it will turn all the dead skin blue and becomes very hard to run in once this happens.
I saw other reviews that said this product was hard to put on, looked pasty-white, shiny. This is not at all what I've found with this sunscreen product. It goes on semi-clear, smooth, non-greasy, easy to rub in. I compared it with the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Soft-Touch 50, and the CereVe works better for me. It's easier to put on,  it's more hydrating than the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc and doesn't make me look pasty-white. The Neutrogena is thicker and harder to put on smoothly, but it's got a higher amount of zinc oxide, whereas CereVe has titanium dioxide as well as zinc oxide. I apply my sunscreen every hour when I'm outside so the size tube could be smaller to fit into my pocket or fanny pack, but I'll still find a way to carry it with me. I like it and I know I'll use it. I'll still use the Neutrogena product in certain situations, but I think my go-to sunscreen from now on will be the CeraVe. I was not given any product nor was I paid for this. It's just my opinion from using both products.
Not moisturizing, felt like putting paste on my face & face felt dry and pulled. Only used once and threw it out.
Several years ago I became seriously sensitive to chemical-based sunscreens. I bought several mineral-based sunscreens but they were all very thick and looked terrible when applied. I love CeraVe products so I bought some of their sunscreen. It is much creamier than the previous ones I’ve tried, and applies easier. Very happy with the CeraVe sunscreen.
I bought this item because I wanted a zinc sunscreen instead of a chemical sunscreen. I like it, but I can't wear it if I know I'll be wearing a mask. Every time I try to wear this and have to put on a mask when I go inside at my college campus, my face starts itching all over under the mask when moisture starts to build. This is unavoidable because masks are required inside on my campus. So I can only really use it when I know I'll just be outside or won't be required to wear a mask. It's a good product, and I’m keeping it, but it's just really annoying that it causes so much itching when I sweat under a mask.
I love this cream, but it was misleading on Amazon. It appeared I was ordering 2. Only one was in the package.
It's too thick…😏
I’m sure the sun protection is fine but it makes my darker skin look gray because it does not blend
I bought this sunscreen after reading the ingredient list multiple times.  I was shocked to find out that this cream was both mineral-based and didn't use oil as a binder.  I am someone that can't stand chemical sunblock and it's chemicals that can be just as damaging as UV rays themselves, but every other sunscreen I tried that has zinc turns so oily on my skin that I might as well have dipped my face in canola oil after sweating for 5 minutes.  Not only does this STAY on your face, but it also doesn't change consistency to a gooey, oily, mess!  For a comparison, it has the consistency of the Eucerine Daily protection, but less chemicals.  It does leave a white cast, be warned, but if you blend it well enough, it will look like you have a "soft focus" effect from a photo app going on, if that makes sense.  The only things that would have made this product better is if 1.  It came in a larger size ( who doesn't always request that ? )  and 2. If it were cruelty free.
The moisturizing is the best as well as the protection
Too hard to blend in. Makes me look too white. Doesn’t have that sunscreen smell though.
I thought this would blend in with your skin tone. It applies as if it was zinc ozide.. it's thick, way too white, doesn't blend in and hard to wash off...super dissatisfied based on the brand...and price....👎
Like it but face area was sensitive.
I was so exited to try it but not sure if 3 stars is even worth it… I put a small amount in my hands then my face and it was a bit sticky and dry which made it difficult to spread. I am very gentle with my face so I didn’t was to rub too hard. It left me soooo white and a bit sticky I just drove home and added Argan oil to be able to spread it then it was fine. But I am not buying this or recommend it. Not sure if adding oil is even a good idea but it helped or maybe I should have put something before. But using it randomly definitely was not a good idea.
It does leave a super white cast on. Tried rubbing it in . But after i put on makeup you cant see it anymore. The tube didnt have a security aluminum peel off tab , dont know if thats normal. Has a not so pleasant smell, but its not the worst. Ill be looking for a new spf after im done with this one.
It does what it’s supposed to do, it protects my skin from the sun. But, it leaves a big white cast, keep in mind I’m already very pale and white but that sunscreen made me look like a literal ghost. I don’t normally wear makeup but the only way I’d be able to go outside with that on was putting like 3 layers of powder on. Overall it does exactly what it’s supposed to do and would not recommend if you are a person of color. Would recommend if you wear makeup that could cover it up and not make you look like a ghost.
I like that it’s mineral and paraben free but it leaves your skin too white so it’s not possible to wear it even if u apply just a little amount of the product
I like the lotion
Literally it makes you look like you are wearing sunscreen you are pale as a ghost! Me my husband everyone who has used it in my family it is so thick that spreading it on it like rubbing calk on your face. My foundation spreads easier! I was hoping it would at least dry clear instead it dries whiter and rubs off like cheap lotion
Rubs in clear.
This a mineral sunscreen, what used to he called sunblock before everyone started calling everything sunscreen. So companies followed.This uses minerals to reflect light off your face. Which means there will be a strong white cast. It’s better for sensitive skin and doesn’t need to be reapplied like sunscreens do (they use molecules that absorb light) but if you have a darker skin tone then this will look like white paste on your skin.I like to layer a little bit of mineral sunscreen(sunblock) over sunscreen to reduce white cast but increase the effectiveness of the protection.
My grandson has sensitive skin, he'll break out in a rash from random things. But he also loves being outside and doing fun things. He has eczema, a very light case now, but it's been an issue. Regular sun blocks would protect him from the sun, but he would also break out because of the lotion. He was have bumps or sometimes just a red irritated look for a day or two after using sun block. My daughter had tried just about all the brands.Someone told me that CeraVe had sun block and it was great. My daughter had no idea they made sun block, but she was familiar with their lotion, because it was always the best in combating his eczema. So I sent her a tube and it's amazing. He doesn't break out at all! It is quite thick, and takes a bit to soak in - so there may be a white sheen on the skin for a bit... but its well worth it.
With this product I cannot do the 3 finger amount because it does not blend into my skin. It makes my face turn into a light purple. I don’t like the way it blends into your skin. I have use the smallest amount and it still doesn’t blend well into my skin.
I don’t really like this sunscreen it leaves a horrible white cast, it’s hard to spread on the face. Just not for me
This is my favorite mineral sunscreen by far. Being a mineral sunscreen, it does leave a white cast (as all mineral sunscreens do!) but it applies easily under makeup and helps protect my face all day. It never irritates my skin and keeps it hydrated even in the dry, cold weather. If you are looking for a sunscreen that doesn't leave a cast, look for a chemical sunscreen!
I'm very fair skin but this is horrible white cast, It does not spread into the skin looks like a white paste on face. Disappointed. They should change the formula.
I have sensitive skin and have to use mineral sunscreen on my face. It seems like every time I find one I really like, it gets discontinued or just becomes really hard to find. That's why I bought this sunscreen. I use CeraVe moisturizer and like it, but this sunscreen is not great. I'm a pale person, and it leaves a white cast. It feels like it just sits on the surface of my skin all day, giving me that uncomfortable clogged pores feeling. Overall it's just disappointing.
I loved this product
I bought it since it was CeraVe and all my skin products are from CeraVe. I am giving it 4 stars since it makes my skin whiter and people keep asking me what the white marks are even when I try hard to spread it and make it less visible.
Ok here's the thing... I usually LOVE CeraVe products so I was very disappointed when I tried this sunscreen. Usually, I use Cotz Mineral Primer because it is literally THE BEST sunscreen I've ever tried. It's super smooth, non-greasy and has 0 white cast. In fact, I often use it as a base makeup on the days that I want a more natural look. The only issue I have with it is the price. I was hoping to find a more affordable "everyday" option and only use Cotz on special occasions which is why I purchased this sunscreen.The moment I put it on, I noticed that it was a super heavy and pasty consistency. The other thing I immediately noticed was the white cast... Normally, I don't mind a little white cast, especially if it sinks in and goes away. This white cast did not go away... I felt like I was putting on a white foundation because it clogged up my pores and dried out my skin. I'm wondering if the consistency is due to its level of sun protection since it's SPF 50. Unfortunately, I won't be able to wear this every day as I was hoping and instead will pack this away in the camping gear for long days in the sun where I don't care what I look like. Overall, definitely won't be buying again in the future...
This review is coming from a 40 + yo male that’s had some sun in the past with some rosacea. I can only talk about my experience with the product and it might be good for others.Pros: is feels like a good moisturizer and makes the face feel really soft when it’s onCons: even using a very small amount of this product, it takes time to get it into the skin.If you are a man with some facial hair and you happen to get some on the hair, you are gonna spend a lot more time getting it offLooks:In the sun or indoors with lights on, I noticed a shine to it. Without light or in the shade, it takes a white tint to it which might be good if you are pale or a vampire.Overall, this product appears to stay on well with some tint abnormalities if you look like me but if you are a lady or a very pale guy, it might be perfect for you. Good luck.
Definitely protects you and great for your skin. Kinda thick so little harder to spread but worth it.
This goes on easily, feels great, moisturizes, and most importantly protects me from the sun.  I have very sensitive, porcelain skin. This does the trick without anything in it that can cause cancer!!
This definitely leaves a white cast which goes away shortly. Sunscreen is supposed to be applied 15+ minutes before sun exposure so the cast is gone by then. It is not easy to apply even after trying different methods...you end up tugging on your face which I try to avoid at my age.My skin is dry to combo and it is almost too hydrating. I found the same with another product that I've used that is highly rated. The one thing it excels at: sun protection, which is why I will keep using it. I have started using it on my hands as well when I anticipate being in the sun. Pick your battles. I want the protection.
My skin is light olive and this product surprisingly blends pretty well and is not garishly "white".The lotion/cream is medium-thick so requires dabbing it on in spots around your face, then patting and blending it in.  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it blended.  There is a slight sheer white sheen initially, but it goes invisible as your body warms it up. It's lightweight as they claim and it is not greasy feeling. With the added ceramides and niacinamide my face never feels dry.  I'm glad Cerave made this SPF 50 and will always have it on hand. I've learned late in life that sunscreen is absolutely necessary to maintain a smooth textured and spot free skin and will use this product to best advantage.  I prefer using the mineral screen over the chemical one because we already face a world with way too many chemicals already.
Works well but I have others I prefer more.  I have a friend with fair skin and he let me use this. He loves it. Never burns with it on. It does leave white on your face but provides a good block. I used his when I visited him in Nevada and had to buy more since we brought his home in our suitcase. Had to replace his-wouldn't want him to burn. So, I still have a partial tube. He now has the new one. I live in a sunshine state and use sunscreen a lot but prefer to just cover up with a hat. I don't think I would use this again if I had a more better alternative made more for women. I've used Image Skincare, Obaji, No 7 (concealer with sunscreen which I love) and now Coola (love this too). I would buy this for the guys in my house who are just looking for a block and don't mind having white show up on their face. Hope this helps.
This stuff is so white it’s embarrassing. You can’t wear it on its own, it does not soak in all day, and you look like a ghost. When you apply makeup over it the makeup looks thick and weird and you have to use a ton to cover the white.
This product really works for me.  It has been protecting me against the burning effects of the sun wherever I am.The only thing that makes me regard it as less than perfect is the slightly tacky feeling it leaves on my skin.  However, it goes on well and lasts well.  I recommend it.  It hasn't stain clothing.
I really disliked this product. I am super pale and it left a white cast on me that never went away, people kept telling me that I looked like a ghost. It's also very hard to spread because it's so thick. It doesn't work well under foundation either. The only sunscreen that I've found that hasn't left me with a white cast and dryness is Black Girl Sunscreen.
I have used this product before and love it.  My skin is very fair and I need sunscreen on my face every day.  Products with 'non-mineral' ingredients (avobenzone, oxybenzone, etc.) seem to creep across my skin and cause my eyes to burn after a few hours.  I also need a non-comedogenic formula.  I will keep using this product but I will buy it in the store where I can check the expiration date because it's just not acceptable to receive the package on Oct 30 and find it expires in January.
Liked the value and level of sun protection. Did not like the white cast, and I'm pretty pale to begin with.
It has pretty strong white cast. I went about 2 shades lighter than my normal skin tone with this on. It was also very thick and somewhat difficult to rub in. Although makeup applies nicely over the top of it and I didnt have any cakeyness or creasing. It did though almost act as a primer and it melted my powers to make them look more like skin which was a plus. If you have oily skin it might just make you look shinny...  but anything to protect me from the sun.
Originally bought this as I love most all CeraVe products, and wanted to keep consistent with my face wash and moisturizers, but its awful. It smells like motor oil, it leaves a HORRID white cast that makes you look like a vampire, it takes a very long time to soak in and for the white cast to shade, and  beware of putting moisturizer ontop of it. You have to wait like 20 mins before you can continue the rest of your skin care or the sunscreen will start to flake and ball up with whatever products are out ontop of it. Not a satisfying purchase.
I chose this because I wanted an everyday mineral sunscreen.  Unfortunately, it is very white and extremely hard to rub in to make it disappear - leaving a whitish cast to the skin, which doesn’t look natural or healthy.  It also is tough to remove - traces were still on my skin after a shower.If you don’t mind these aspects, then you might like this product.  I will go back to a tinted mineral sunscreen instead.
Its pretty good.
We needed to find a spf 50 for the face, as recommended by our dermatologist.  We tried this, wanting something that did not make your face white.  Unfortunately, you still get the white affect with this product.  CeraVe is a great product, but if you are looking for a clear appearance, you will not get it with this product.
Say goodbye to sunburn anywhere you wear it...saved my boy while on the lake for 5 days😎
This sunscreen works incredibly well, and as usual CeraVe did a great job with the formula. It spreads easily and is moisturising without being greasy. However, it leaves the most intense white cast I've ever seen with a sunscreen. I'm very pale and even on me it looks ridiculous. So if you're a person of color this product probably won't work for you unless you want to look like you're wearing Elizabethian makeup (in which case, go for it).For this reason I don't recommend it for everyday wear. You'll have to apply a lot of makeup to cover up the white cast. This is more for a day when you're going to be outside all day. I live in a cold and overcast area so for this reason I won't buy this again until summer and will find a different everyday sunscreen.
the cream looked like new but the box and container of the cream looked weird.  I'm used to buying that cream in stores and they don't look the same.  the cream only came halfway.  I tried a little bit of the cream on my hand and it stay white, it does not seal well on the skin, the skin does not dissolve it.
I'm sure it's effective sunscreen but it doesn't go away.  Even after 3 hours, my skin was still white.
So the product does well to protect the skin, it just leaves a white cast & will pill if mixed with something else. I usually use a moisturizer with my sunscreen & even when I waited a while to put on the sunscreen it pilled & was a really thick white cast. I had to rinse my face & then reapply the sunscreen. Also forget about wearing makeup with this because it does the same thing with your makeup. It looks horrendous. So just expect to only wear this & this only if you buy it. Which is totally fine, it is designed to protect the skin which is what it does!
I use this for swimming pool days.I recommend mixing the sunscreen with moisturizer to make easy the application.
I'm sure the SPF is fine and I bet the ceramides are terrific. But the shine after application is just too much.I only use this after microneedling, chemical peals, or laser treatments. Otherwise I use ELTA MD. Unfortunately those are not all mineral sunscreens so I need to switch to CeraVe or something all mineral when I have a treatment which counterindicates chemical sunscreen.
Feels great and no break Outs on my sensitive skin!
The product was described as facial and lightweight. It leaves your face very white and does not absorb into skin. It applies like a paste. I do not recommend as a facial sunscreen.
Certainly does the job but I hate that it turns my face white and stays that way.
Finally, a sunscreen I can trust to protect the sensitive eczema-prone skin on my face.  It's very moisturizing, has a very subtle scent, and really protects.  However, it is not light or sheer.  In fact, I would describe it as "heavy" and "creamy."  It's heavy enough that it actually lends a sort of pale cast to your skin when you're wearing it. This is worth it for me when I need real sun protection, more than just a moisturizer with SPF.  I was previously using the Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer in SPF 50.  It is more sheer, but gets slimy and stings my eyes when I'm really sweating (like in an outdoor workout or at the pool).  This is now my go-to sunscreen for any outdoor activity.  It works, it lasts, it moisturizes, and my sensitive skin doesn't mind it.
Great sunscreen protection.
After noticing this was an oil free formula, I specifically asked whether this worked over oil-based moisturizers. People said it did. However, I suspect these folks are using thin, "lightweight" lotions not heavy creams. This absolutely DOES NOT go on smoothly over an oil based moisturizer. It's patchy and streaky as the oils and water don't really mix. You HAVE to wear makeup over it to cover it up.And the trouble is... whatever is in this stuff RUINS makeup every time! My favorite mineral makeup settled into pores and goes on patchy with this. Last straw was when I was going to the Renaissance Fair, I used a great primer, longwear foundation and setting spray over the Cerave sunscreen... the makeup began FLAKING OFF and it was impossible to repair. I had to wear a mask because there was no way to fix it, even washing off and starting over it just began again because it was the sunscreen causing the trouble. This bottle went into the trash after that. Never using this brand again!
The SPF is good. Broad spectrum, to protect from UVA and UVB. I like the fact it is mineral based, but the minerals make the sunscreen leave behind a white cast.The white cast can be fixed be applying the sunscreen first, then using a moisturizer on top of it and coating your skin evenly in it. Also, only using about a teaspoon on the sunscreen for each application helps reduce the appearance of the white cast.Overall, a good product with good protection. Needs some help when being spread. Easily fixed with moisturizer.
Great sun protection but it leaves a major white cast. Even putting it on as suggested in tiny spots around the face almost does nothing. Then you're tugging at your skin to try and spread it. Ugh.. BUT I've found if you put it on RIGHT AFTER your moisturizer, it spreads and blends soooo much easier. Overall good product though.
Only used this product once and it left a white cast. And it was not easy to spread around so couldn’t say if it actually protected me from the sun but I will not be using again for my face maybe for my body.
This is the second summer wetpurchased this for our toddler. Works great and very good on his sensitive skin. Our toddler has eczema and this doesn’t irritate it at all!
Works and isn’t greasy. But very hard to work into skin. Leaves white cast and I have pale skin.
I only use this when I'm working out outside or I know I'm going to be directly in the sun for more than an hour or two. I never burn or tan but it is really difficult to apply. Never truly seems to absorb on medium skin so I would definitely NOT reccomend for my beautifully chocolate friends. I only wore it under my eyes in this pic but I just wanted you all to see my complexion. It definitely leaves a white cast on me.
I use other CeraVe products, and love them, but I couldn't get past the thick lotion. It made my face white and wouldn't rub in all the way. However, it did appear to work on keeping the sun from burning me - I just can't get past the white face. I'll go back to my Neutrogena sunscreen.
I bought this for my neck, which sometimes burns, and for my chocolate colored sun worshiping toddler.  We both ended looking like ghosts. It stays on the toddler all day through many pool capers AND through bath time.  It takes slathering her up with coconut oil to eventually get it to come off of her.  It didn't seem particularly moisturizing at all, actually it seems rather drying.  But hey, as long as she's protected from skin cancer and my neck isn't burning, it's better than nothing.
I was hoping to combine my moisturizing and sunscreen regimen into one step, but I can't quite do it here. The product didn't feel as moisturizing as a moisturizing cream.  As a sunblock, I haven't truly put it to the test, but I like to use only mineral sunscreens and this fits that bill.  It does leave my skin looking a little white, which I am ok with. It had no smell, which I like.  The product did not come with a safety seal, which concerned me at first, but I read that that is how it normally comes new.
I bought this sunscreen because my old spf burned my eyes and made me break out, i would like to say i've been using this one for a few days and it does not burn my eyes or make me breakout, it also doesn't feel greasy at all and only feels moisturizing on the skin after it has sunk in. However, this is a horrid whitecast that  you have to spend quite a bit of time rubbing in, other than that unfortunate fact i would recommend! If you are a POC or a bit tanner like me I'd maybe look into a less white casty sunscreen but this one is not awful.
Dude.  This stuff is THICK zincy/mineraly sunblock.  As in you need to work it in pronto AND then really work in either a light moisturizer or primer on top of this...otherwise you'll have gray face all day.  If you don't want to do either suggestion, then at the very least take a foundation/kobuki brush and buff that sh*t into your skin....or a damp beauty blender to rehydrate it enough to work around and spread it down to your neck or something.I legit thought I was getting sick or not sleeping well until I realized it's not ME, it's just I'm not working this sunblock like I should be.  I'm super pale and it made me look grey, even under a full face of nakeup (light/medium coverage) .
I love their moisturizer so I decided to try this product. Unfortunately, the sunscreen causes really bad white casting. I am a very pale person but this sunscreen has made me look even paler - like a ghost. I will keep it and use for extreme situations like hiking or for my face at the beach but will be looking for an alternative for daily wear.
It gives a blotchy appearance. It does not smoothly blend with your skin.
This product was horrible!  As soon as I put it on my face and skin, my skin was white!  I tried rubbing this in for almost a half hour and my skin was still white and it looked ridiculous!  No matter how much I tried, I could not get rid of the white until I finally washed it off!  I even kept trying to rub it in periodically over 2 hours and the whiteness would still not go away (it did subside a little, but it still looked white on my skin).  I only used about a dime-sized amount on my face so it wasn't like I lathered it on.  Also, I'm very pale white as it is, so if this made my skin even more whiter, I could only imagine how ridiculous it would look on someone with darker skin!  I returned this product because of this reason.  I'm sure it would've been a great product, if it didn't keep your skin white, but who knows.
All PHYSICAL sunscreen will be difficult to spread and leave a white tint behind. The active ingredients (zinc oxide and titanium dioxide) are also pigments that make white paint. Rather than the chemical UV protectants (like oxybenzone) that soak into the skin and get into your blood, these sit on the surface and eventually fall off.I am a chemist and a burn survivor that happened from a fire at work. While I'm healing, UV exposure has the threat of leaving my affected skin permanently discolored. This means that I have to wear sunscreen everyday, and putting traditional sunscreen on daily would increase my exposure to oxybenzone and oxycrylene, which is why I am using this product and I'm glad it has a moisturizing effect as well!
Overall this seems like a good tinted SPF. The only thing I don’t like is that is makes my skin look so greasy. Because of this, I tend to not reach for this SPF in the mornings. But it’s not bad, and it seems to protect my skin well from the sun.
If you’re ok with having a pure white face this stuff is good.
I give it 4 stars because it can go on chalky. I have to rub it in quite a bit but once it is on, it looks fine. I like a sunscreen with high percentage of physical sunscreen. Also, it's priced well.
This product is so thick and white that it leaves your skin pale. I found it to be very hard to remove. It doeshowever protect from sun. I would have returned but time lapsed before I used it.
This product is hard to apply - very sticky and patchy. It also leaves a very noticeable white cast. Won’t buy again
This is my favorite facial sunscreen. It leaves a slight white cast on even my light ivory skin, so careful for those with darker skin unless you wear makeup on top of it. It does not pill under makeup and moisturizes well. It doesn’t make me breakout on my sensitive skin.  I’m just disappointed that the one I got had an expiration date only 2 months away. I guess it’s technically not a big deal since I’m in the middle of the hot summer and will likely use it all. But I have no choice but to order online since I never see this in stores. So just don’t go ordering multiple ones at once keeping the expiration date issue in mine, that I’ve seen in other reviews too.
I like Cera Ve products very much, and this is excellent sunblock with both titanium dioxide and zinc.  If you really want to protect your skin, you need both these ingredients.  Having said that, it does leave your skin with a whitish sheen, so if you're more worried about how it looks than superior sun protection, you may not like it.  Also, it has a slight chemical odor to it.  I don't mind any of that because I'm far more concerned about a recurring case of skin cancer than I am anything else.  I will continue to purchase it.  I'm happy they improved their formula and that the increased the size of the tube so you don't have to buy it so often.  Good price if you want excellent sun protection.
I definitely would not reccomend this. I immediately got rid of it after using it once.It’s thick and somewhat chalky, and worst of all it leaves a white cast that is impossible to blend out.Keep in mind I’m very pale. I normally use the cerave AM spf 30 moisturizing lotion for normal/combination skin. It leaves a slight white cast, but it’s hydrating and easy to blend. It does leave a bit of shine but nothing bad, it’s oil free.If you’re looking for something that doesn’t leave a white cast and is a clean chemical sunscreen, I’d reccomend the Supergoop unseen sunscreen. It’s spf 40, doesn’t leave any cast whatsoever (it’s completely clear), blends like a dream and doubles as a primer.If you want to stick with Cerave, their ultra light matte spf 30 am lotion is great. It doesn’t leave a cast, is extremely light, easy to blend and moisturizing yet matte.If you want a good mineral sunscreen, I’d check out Supergoop and Coola. Cerave’s just doesn’t have the formulation right and the white cast is insane.
I wear it when I go running and doesn’t sweat off. It does make face white since it’s a physical block.  Don’t need to use a lot of it.
So a lot of complaints say this doesn't spread and leaves a white case. I can say I was super disappointed as well. To be fair the description warns you about this applying a small amount at a time and rubbing it in well to prevent this.If that still leaves a white cast, its because it's 100% mineral based, but don't worry, i got you sis.Take a dab of cerave, and a dab of face lotion(maybe cerave face lotion), and mix it on your fingers.  Problem solved!! I admittedly don't use a ton of sunblock, but i do use enough that even with this technique I still have a SLIGHT white hue. Not as noticeable before and perfectly acceptable in day to day life!!! I no longer feel like a clown
Im natururally quite pale, and with this sunscreen I look like a ghost! And its doesn't spread evenly. It sits on your skin like a thick white butter.  Oh gosh! To remove this stuff I need to wash my face 2-3 times! I have accidentally applied this spf to my eyebrows, so I had to use shampoo and oil to remove it. Awful product! Never expected something like this from Cerave....
I’ve spread this product for 10 minutes and it still has a white cast. White cast stays for about three hours then blends in with my skin. Non-greasy, a tad bit moisturizing, definitely white cast whiter than my skin tone. Love cerave but this product was disappointing for me :(
This product leave your skin white.  It doesn't soak in
Does exactly what it’s supposed to do.
Assume it works in sunblock protection so use it when outside.  Applies like white paste though.
As a fair-skinned red head, I need sunscreen year around.  This works great and is not overpowering on my skin.
Not great at all leaves a horrid white cast even if you a small amount. Does not spread easily and doesnt make your skin feel nice afterwards. I have gone back to using a chemical sunscreen Ambre Solaire much better.
This is okay face sunscreen I don’t like the white cast and it’s almost impossible to rub in and the only thing I like about this sunscreen is the spf 50 but I will not be purchasing this sunscreen again don’t recommend.UPDATE: After using for a couple weeks I am now breaking out because of it will never buy again. Don’t buy this!!! It had terrible white cast as well!!
If you want to look like a ghost, then this is the product for you! I bought this because Cerave is a great product for skin but it is not easy to spread evenly. It leaves a white film (at least on dark skin) and you just look horrible. Not a fan of this. If you trying to pick up men on the beach, Ladies… esp dark skin women…. Don’t do this, I promise you will go home alone :(
I love SPF and put this on every morning. I have very dry skin (eczema), so I mix this with my normal moisturizer and it helps the white cast. Doesn't break me out. If you aren't mixing it, it can be a little hard to spread.
I don't like how it leaves a whiter look on your face if your face isn't washed yet. It overall does the job for protecting your skin and is moisturizing without the sunscreen smell and oily feeling. I try to mix it with their facial moisturizer to prevent the white cakey look. Bottle is pretty small but it can last.
This is all I use works amazing . Love the way it feels on my face !
Hurrrrgh. Yeah, you're gonna wanna trust the reviews for this one. The white cast is nuuuuts on the product I got, and I am FAIR fair. Also had a bit of pilling issue when used at the end of my skincare routine. CeraVe has some wonderful skincare products, but I would personally only recommend this one if you're swimming or doing a long hike that requires some very obvious and intense sunscreen. For the ability to fade into my skin, I would choose Neutrogena sunscreen or another for my daily use.
Perfect sunscreen
I need maximum sun protection because I break out into a red itchy rash otherwise.  This sunscreen has prevented me from getting that rash, so I'm quite relieved and grateful for that.  But it's quite thick and thus quite hard to rub in.  Even when I think I've gotten it rubbed in well, later in the day I see streaks of it I missed.  It's effective but cumbersome.
I’ve heard so many reviews about this product! This sunscreen definitely does the job of protecting. I was super sad to try this sunscreen, and not have it work on me, since I use mostly cerave products. As someone who has naturally tan skin, I wouldn’t recommend it to people of color. It leaves a white cast, and doesn’t melt into the face like other sunscreen
MY Dermatologist recommended. Cost alot less here than there. Bit a white facewhen applied, but I use for golfing, skeet range, water sports etc. Better be protected and  I also now wear 3 inch brim hats. Melanoma runs in the family. Be safe, protect. My white face after application, people ask ....after discussion they are looking for this type protection. It works. Mike L
Loved this. The only issue is the film of the  product was th main issue. It's still showing after 3 hrs.
Smooth and easy to apply. Good amount and quality for the price.
I am 52 yrs old and have Lupus and eczema, so I must use a mineral sunscreen and still can have allergic reactions. This is the ONLY sunscreen out of the dozens I've used that I have had no bad reaction to!!!! It moisturizes my skin and the sunblock works perfectly!!!This is very thick and white, so I use it as primer and spf. Once foundation is applied over this, after this has absorbed (30 seconds), the white cast is undetectable and my skin appears smoother, no pores!!!!I will continue to purchase this as long as they make it.
Is ok, my understanding is that mineral sunblocks is better for ur body as well as enviroment but is everything but easy to spread and leave white film on your face. So i dont recommend under make up, only for a day by the pool or so....
I was hoping to find a daily use sunblock for my face. Even though this is a good brand and designed for facial application, it will not work for daily use. It is difficult to spread on delicate skin such as around the eyes. It is unflattering in regard to how it sits on the skin and my face has a weird white and shiny look to it. This will likely be good for a day in the sun without makeup, but will not work for daily use.
Sunblock for face
My only complaint is that the white caste from this sunscreen is very intense. I was hoping it would be a daily sunscreen since I live in Florida and do a lot of driving, but it just makes my face too white.
Okay. I'm coming after everyone who says it sucksI'm pale as the snow so of course  the white cast doesn't show. If you have darker skin tones please get a different one <3I have highly irritable skin from eczema. And this felt heavenly! And still does. I plan on using this for foundation to help my vampiric  behind in the sun.+++++The scent is barely there? I was suprised. It vaugley smells like minerals  but that has to be up close to your face and looking for a scent. +++++Its super freaking moisturizing
The ingredients in CeraVe products are usually great unfortunately this sunscreen leaves a very heavy white cast. It is easy to spread at first and does moisturize but as soon as it sets if you continue to blend in it turns into flakes and comes off and forget about putting make up over it. So if you are only concerned about the sun protection and dont care about the white cast than I guess this is a good product for you.
Look, I am about as white as they come, and this stuff just never absorbed well or lost its extremely white cast (more like mask). Can't imagine what it would look like if put the correct amount needed for full sun protection. The only way I could use it was to top it off with a tinted sunscreen, and that still didn't eliminate the whiteness completely. Really disappointed since other Cerave products are so good.
Ok mixed emotions its a great product and is not oilly..but im tan and even with a good lather my face is left with that white look , with no.makeup i look weird wearing it..but with makeup is a great product just wish the product was shear
We all need sun protection everyday.  It is easy to spread on.  Have given it to my grandchildren.
It left my face looking white. It's protective but I'd rather get one that blends better
I do not doubt that it fulfills the purpose of protecting against UV rays.  But unless you are a GEISHA, I do not recommend this product, because of how white your face will look when you use it, as well as how little moisture it has.  I recommend that you look for some other option.
Derm recommended this for my skin.  Will not make you break out!  It is ultra protecting against the sun but your face will be super white.  I mix with my ESTEEE lauder SPF and it works well.
This is literally like putting white paint on your face.... i give it 4 stars cuz it obvs works. However, the white didn't go away and I had to blend more moisturizer on to fade the white. The white cast stayed for a very long time 😬. So id keep that in mind if you wanted to give this a shot and your skin isnt #FFFFFF exactly.
No way around it. I Even tried with makeup on top, absolutely white and cakey. It's a no for me.
I disliked the way when once applied it darkened my darker areas of my face.  I prefer the 30% SPF protection face moisturizer.  However, the reason I wanted to try SPF50 is for more protection from sun exposure.  I'm sending mine back that I just oredered for a refund.  i will have to use SPF30 until you  all can make the SPF50 workable for my skin complexion.
It's not easy to apply as well and you pretty much have to rub it to spread it evenly. And it's not colourless.
I gave this a three, because it most assuredly block the sun’s rays, but I look flat out like a geisha.  Makeup covers it to some degree, but I still am well past my normal pallor.It isn’t greasy, and seems to play well with makeup, but if you have the tiniest amount of color to your skin you will look like a disembodied head.I love Cerave products, and repeatedly buy many of them, but this will not be one of them.
I love Cerave skin lotion for my face, but this stuff...... Absolute crap, I think think this was invented as a seriously screwed up practical joke. When you apply it and rub it in on and into your face (or so you think you are rubbing it in) it leaves a slight white haze that you can live with because you think the rest will just absorb in.That’s when Cerave starts to giggle at you.  Within 20 minutes of applying it comes back out giving you a deathly pale look about you AND now the product is full out laughing at you. .My story:  In my extremely well lit bathroom  I applied liberally because I burn easily, got it to a point of not having too much white junk on my face that I could live with and hopped on my motorcycle to meet my guys for a ride. Got to the first destination spot within 20 minutes and was met with laughter and taunts of being called Dr. Evil.  I can take a joke because I give them too so it’s part of the game with my friends, but I refuse to walk around with this crap on my face making me look like  a corpse.
It is good but leaves a white cast
First of all, hate writing reviews, hardly ever do them! So, Im have pretty light skin, with a bit of rosacea on my cheeks. This sunscreen has a glue-ish texture, very sticky and super hard to spread!! Ive tried and tried to work it out but no success! I literally looked like a freaking corpse, omg! The only solution, in a pinch, was rubbing a tinted sunscreen on top and run to work. One of my biggest Cerave disappointment, did not expect that! I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone, unless you want to look like you were sprayed with white paint… No thanks!!
So i bought this product thinking it was a rlly nice, lightweight lotion for my face, which is mostly my fault because other reviews do note that its more a sunscreen &less of a moisturizer. Its a great sunscreen! Very nice coverage, doesn't smell or make my skin feel greasy, but I don't think this is a good product for your face! It leaves a terrible white case and I also noticed it broke apart my foundation really bad. If you want to use it on your face, I suggest rubbing it in really good on your fingers before putting it on your face and mixing a little bit of your favorite lotion with it!
I'm torn on this, because while it feels and smells better than the AM facial moisturizing lotion, it makes my face visibly white.  Not ideal for daily wear, I guess just for beach days.
Not smooth enough to wear the suncream.
I brought it because my dermatologist recommended it. But this has to be the worst sunscreen I ever used. It does not blend in. I tried for a few minutes. At first I took the recommended amount but after putting a little in my face, I decided to not put the rest. After trying for sooo long it was still white all over my face. I had to go out  and I didn’t have time to wash my face and when I got home 1 hour later I could still see the sunscreen. Then I tried a little amount on my hands but it got on my clothes. I guess I just have to throw it away. Absolutely a waste of money. DO NOT buy. 10/10 would NOT recommend.
I love Cerave products, but not this one.  It does not absorb into the skin and sits on the face like a coat of white paint.  I will use it up on other parts of my body, but I will not repurchase.  I am disappointed.
This lotion is easy to spread and doesn't leave the face quite as whitened as others.  Having said that there is still a bit of a white to it.  It seems to be doing a good job.  I live in FL and use it everyday.
Prevention against skin cancer.
It's good I need heavy sunblock. I'm almost 40 and it's super important. It looks great under makeup but be warned it does leave a white cast which I'm fine with cause it brightens my skin.
I swear by every CeraVe product I’ve ever bought, except for this one. I have my CeraVe morning face routine, and no matter how long I wait to put the sunscreen on after, it’ll become the mayor of pulling city and, I have to end up washing it off my face. So I put it on my neck and chest instead, and I still seems to miss spots that are really white and chalky. Maybe I just got a bad one from the batch?? I’m so disappointed.also makes my greasy face remember the old days and my face gets real shiny.
works well
This sunscreen is genuinely lé WORST. I wouldn't feel obligated to leave a scathing review of this sunscreen wasn't marketed as a FACE sunscreen. I know that sunscreen need to be "worked in" but im also almost 40 and I'm not willing to take a floor buffer to my face--and in this case, I don't know if it would help.The photo attached is after I worked it in moderately AND wore it for over an hour. You would not want to leave the house of you applied anywhere near the appropriate amount of product for sun protection.I actually purchased this as a neck sunscreen (who's extra? It. Me.) So youThat I wouldn't burn through my more expensive sunscreen or worry about a tint on my clothes. The formula is not drying, but I will not be repurchase this product even for my neck because the cast is out of this world and is not manageable.My holy grail sunscreen is the La Roche Posay tinted Anthelios mineral spf 50, that one is worth every penny (watch for coupons to grab it for less than $30!). I also enjoy the Cera Ve hydrating tinted SPF 30, though I wish it were available in a higher SPF.Either way, this one is an unbearable mess, IMHO.
Great product. It goes on good but leaves the skin looking kinda purple almost in color. So make sure you start off with a small amount. I made the mistake of smearing it all over my face out on the boat and had my husband laughing. Love aimee CeraVe though!
I usually use a moisturizer before putting this on. It spreads on easily, but stays white for a bit. I try to wait a few minutes to let it absorb before doing anything else.
I love that it does not irritate my highly sensitive skin and it definitely keeps me from burning. The disadvantage for me is that it does not run in clear, a white tint is left on my face which is rather unattractive. I recommend using it for nose and cheeks perhaps when out on a boat or surfing for excellent protection.
Good for oily acne prone skin. No breakouts and it doesn't feel greasy. BUT I look like GHOST. I know its because its a mineral sunscreen but  it leaves a lot of white cast. Also, my eyes burn every time I wash my face or if I sweat while wearing it
This sunscreen is lightweight and not greasy, it is the kind that sets down and kinda feels matte. It didn’t feel moisturizing to me but also not drying. The issue I had was that it has an INTENSE white cast. I’m really pale, I usually use foundation shades with “fair” in the name, and this sunscreen makes me look dead. It also wasn’t great under makeup for me.
I love this product!  When I read the reviews I was concerned with some that posted that the product would make you look pale, etc.  I thought I would give it a try anyway.  I use it on my face when I walk in the AMs.  It disappears after I apply it and it protect me very well.  I had a small bit of cancer on my nose and after having it removed, the doctor recommended that I use a good sunscreen.  I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it.
The only thing I don't like about this product is it leaves a shiny white coating on my face.  HOWEVER, the benefits of the sun protection and the moisturizing capability outweigh this.  I use it whenever I'm outside for an extended period and have never been disappointed, or burned!
Good product. A little thick so it doesn't absorb as well as I would like. So I add a little coconut oil to thin it out.
I heard great things about CeraVe so I have this SPF a chance. It is extremely drying and has a chalky texture. Very dry and it does not absorb into your skin. Stays white on your face all day long! I had this product on for over 7 hours and it stayed white on my face all day. This is the first CeraVe product I’ve ever used…..and it will be the last. Extremely dissatisfied.
It leave your face like a mime
Sun protection is good it does what it supposed to do, protect really good, but I didn’t like the White residuals it leave, plus it’s not moisturizing, I try to use my normal moisturizer before the sunscreen but still the white residuals are a pain.Personal opinion, I didn’t  like it but everyone is different it might work well for you.
I’ve used several CeraVe products and have never been disappointed. I especially like their CeraVe eczema/anti-itch cream.The sunscreen goes a long way as you don’t need but a little bit. I work all day in my garden-full sun. I wear a broad brim hat and gloves. My arms and legs are fully exposed to the blazing sun and I have yet to be disappointed.My dermatologist recommended the entire product line and she was right they work as advertised.
this moisturizer feels really nice and i love this brand but it’s hard to spread and leaves my face looking white like the sunscreen wouldn’t set on my face
This sunscreen leaves an unnatural purplish-grayish white tint on your face and it doesn't go away. It literally persists throughout the day and gets worse if you go active and sweat. The sunscreen will crumble up to little soft white balls and stick everywhere. Doesn't help if applied on arms either.
This is thick, hard to spread and blend, and leaves a horrible white cast. I tried mixing it with a bb cream, and that was actually acceptable (mixed 3/4 to 1), but I prefer to use a moisturizer/sunscreen combo on my face. So now I'm trying to use it with my body lotion so it won't go to waste, and it completely overpowers my lotion moreso than the bb cream. I have to mix it four of five parts lotion to one part this and still have to work it into my skin to blend away the white cast.I really wanted to love this because CeraVe has become one of my favorite brands, which is why I bought two of these and didn't feel rushed to try it. Now it's too late to return, so I'm stuck trying to improvise.
I had to return this -- it's too think to use!
I like the ingredients in the product, does not break me out like other ones do, not greasy. She reallllyyy thiccc thou. Hard to spread on face, I suggest warming up the product on your hands and massaging it well in your hands before applying. It does stick to your hair line, so if you do not blend well it can start to pill after it's sort of dried. But, sun protection is very important so I'm dealing with it. Will not be rebuying simply because of the whitecast, buy a tinted sunscreen instead.
work well but you can't rub it in makes a person look very pale not a good look inpublic.
Product tube is not sealed and cap came off one during shipping which cause a loss of sunscreen.
great sun protection,  thick and hard to spread especially over my daily moisturizer.  Leaves a white cast and streaks. This can be worked with for lighter skin tones and if you have sensitive skin that requires mineral spf its doable.  It does however moisturize and improve the skin barrier well. I will continue to buy as it is the best option in my price range.
Okay sonic bought this because it has niacinamide in it as well as high SPF. I read the reviews and figured maybe the white cast won't be as bad on me considering I am very fair. Boy was I wrong lol. I looked very sick when I applied this to my face. The white cast is strong in this product. That being said it does work well and I plan on using it for myself and my children when we go kayaking in the summer for an extra boost of protection while we are on the water. It didn't dry my skin out or cause any breakouts, just gave off a hard white cast.
Has a strong white cast so won't use it on my face but will use it on the back of my hands and arms only.  White cast goes away eventually if I rub it in enough.  Will use for this summer but will not buy again.
It’s good but it’s better to buy stronger protection specially for the hot sunny days
Honestly I bought this because I gave into the hype over cerave products. I needed a sunscreen so I decided to give this one a try, i’m not saying that it doesn’t do it job it certainly does however it feels horrible on the skin. It’s very sticky, will definitely leave a white cast and isn’t easy to blend out. Definitely wasn’t expect a negative outcome but it’s okay, i’ll probably give it away. Don’t buy it not worth the money, will leave you feeling sticky and looking like a ghost.
Gave 4 star because the mineral does not spread even and white stays on face other than this it works
It's not sticky and makes my skin feel nice after putting it on. Definitely don't need much since It will give a white cast if yu use too much.I like it for summer going to the beach, or spending a lot of time outside. But for every day use, might be a little much.
Hard to spread, leaves my face white looking.
Leaves a white film on black skin.
Does leave a white cast but if you mix with some tinted moisturizer it is great.
This product doesn't irritate my skin like a lot of other sunscreens tend to do, but it leaves a terrible white cast that can never be rubbed all the way in. My skin is relatively pale and this sunscreen makes me look grey, so I would not recommend this product, especially to anyone with darker skin.
So far of using it, it makes my skin look PALE and I know sunscreen regularly does that but people ask if I’m ok and I don’t even put that much. I might change sunscreen but skin care wise I like this one. I haven’t worn makeup on top of it but I feel like it’s going to look cakey considering the consistency of the sunscreen is semi thick. I’ve worn thicker though that’s for sure. If you plan to wear makeup over itmaybe look at a different brand?
Purchased for face coverage as the product was advertised. Not pleased as it was NOT SHEER Coverage as I would have assumed it to be for faces. Left a white, pasty coverage that was NOT easy to blend all over my face.
I like Cervave products, but not this one! It feels heavy on my face. I will use on my arms until it is empty.
I was super excited because I love CeraVe products but this sunscreen is almost useless. It’s super thick and heavy feeling and it doesn’t blend into the skin! I’m already very pale but it makes my skin just ghostly white. Also it started burning and drying out my skin after a bit even though it says moisturizing. Would not recommend.
I really love this app lotion, its mineral so it doesn't bleach the reefs, and it works really well. The only thing I really don't like is the very heavy white cast.
I use this in combination with CeraVe moisturizer and differin for acne. It's great as a sunblock, but you gotta work it in well or else it goes on very white. Still like it though.
Just threw it out once I realized even a thin layer makes me look like a zombie. Wtf, what a waste. Wish I had read the reviews. This should not have such a high review score. Amazon just doesn’t care.
This is so thick that when I put it on my face it does not blend well. It almost makes my face look purple. I opted to just use this on my hands and forearms and got a light sunscreen from super goop for my face.
After reading the reviews about the white cast, I thought maybe it's because people did not let it absorb or they did not rub it in enough.  I went ahead and purchased this and gave it a try.  It was so chalky white and I let it sit on my face for two hours.  The white cast did not go away.  Whether or not this sunscreen works or not, doesn't matter.  I can't get over the crazy white cast.  I have medium fair skin tone, btw.
Thai has great and healthy protection from the sun. I’m a big sun believer and love getting Vit D, but your face is a terrible place to get it 😂It does have a bit of a whitish caste to it which is to be expected with mineral sunscreen.  But it’s not bad and is fine.I use .025 Tretinoin (Retin A) every evening (because I’m almost 50!) so I need good sun protection when I’m outside.
I wish I had read the reviews before buying it, it’s white white and makes you look like a clown and just stays white and difficult to remove it, I bought it for my vacation but I had to purchase another one, do NOT recommend
I thought this product was going to be amazing. Cerave is always a go to brand for my sensitive skin. However, this sunscreen is not my go to. It was hard to spread, left my face extremely white and was really drying. It didn’t clog my pores, but left me with the worst dry patches!
I have never not liked a CeraVe product before but this sunscreen is horrible. I swapped to mineral sunscreen for my rosacea but it is heavy, will not blend in, cannot be worn under makeup and stays white on your skin.I own a small farm so I've been using it on my body when I'm out working in the sun and don't care what I look like. My husband always makes fun of me because my arms, chest, and shoulders look like I've covered them in white halloween makeup. The one positive this I can say about it is that I can be out working in the sun for 6 hours and not get a hint of pink which is impressive because I burn very easily.
Was excited to try this product. The protection is great, it is somewhat moisturizing, it’s not greasy, but does leave a white cast and it gets flaky when you rub too much trying to spread it throughout the face. It might be worth it for the pool or beach, but not for daily use under makeup.
This sunscreen will give you a noticeable white cast. It's also not very moisturizing. It kinda stuck to my dry spots and made them look worse. I tried mixing it with my moisturizer but that didn't really help. I wouldn't really recommend it especially if you have dry skin. :/
I ordered this sunscreen and the Sun Bum mineral sunscreen as pregnancy-safe options to use. The Cerave sunscreen did not rub in very well at all. I know this is usually true of mineral sunscreens, at least definitely with those I have tried, but my entire face looked like I used the fairest powder I could find and applied that all over.It also doesnt rub in very easily, but I was also super impatient and wanted to get outside when I was applying it.
Decent sun protection, but terrible white cast on the skin! Takes a lot to work into the skin to minimize noticeable color. Not good for subtle application.
Great sunscreen but leaves a white cast for the first few hours after you wear it. Even when completely rubbed in. Good protection though.
This is not a thin, lotion-like sunscreen. This will paste on to your skin and turn you white. If you use foundation, definitely put this on underneath.
The product does a great job at sun protection but leaves a white film behind. I have a tan complexion and my boyfriend is white (like pale) and after blending it vigorously, it left a white film on both of us.
I bought this sunscreen to add to my daily regimen because of the new AHAs I've included suggest additional sun protection. I was hopeful because CeraVe is known for its lotions. While using the product I did not burn however in the application tips it says "the formula should spread easily, leaving a lightweight, non-greasy feel." This product did not spread easily and felt as light as cheap drugstore foundation. Fortunately the greasy feeling only took 20 minutes to go away. The directions state to "apply liberally" but the application tips say to "apply a small amount in the palm of your hands." Well, apply it liberally and you end up looking like a ghost. Apply a small amount to your palm and "rubbing well" is just schmusing your face all over in a very unpleasant manner. I can't imagine wearing makeup under this. Definitely don't recommend unless you're going for a cliche white cast sunscreened face like you see on the kids with helicopter moms in movies.
After reading all the good reviews I bought this sunscreen. And boom it leaves a fresh white film on your face. Though it is light weight and has a couple beneficial ingredients. Whats the point if I’m going to look like Jason with his mask on.
My husband skin started to get sensitive to sun screens. He foundCeraVe sun screen. We both like it alot, he does not get sun burns, its very easy to spread.  The only thing that's different is when he spreads it over his face - we know what he will look like with gray stubble face. 🤣 its so funny.
White overcast alert!! Had to mix w/regular face lotion before applying so it wouldn’t leave that awful overcast look. Also, easy to spread when mixed w/another lotion. I guess the upside is that it last longer.
Product is too pasted and heavy, doesn’t feel moisturiser at all
I love CERAVE  brand, but this sunscreen is terrible. It’s pasty, it doesn’t blend, the skin doesn’t absorb the product and you look like you painted your skin white, plus it makes my skin irritated.Truly there are other better options out there.CERAVE needs to work on the formulation, this is not aceptable at all. So disappointed.
most of the reviews said the same thing so I shouldve known, but the sunscreen is SUPER thick and white. not the easiest to spread either but works great at protecting skin. Definitely would not wear this over or under makeup
I love Cera Ve products but am very disappointed in the amount of white cast left on the skin. Even after rubbing for several minutes there’s a whiteish tint to my face. I wanted to use it as my daily sunscreen but this makes it hard and for the price I don’t feel like this should be a thing.
Even if this product has great sunscreen protection and is moisturizing, the white cast I get from using this product cancels out all the benefits.I applied this product on my face 3 times and every time I rubbed it in really well and it looked like I had applied a layer of white costume makeup on my face. Even if this is a great product otherwise, I don't want to go out looking like a clown.Great brand but this product falls short.
I was aware this SPF will leave a white cast. It's true, but... Considering the ingredients and benefits I like it. I totally recommend this item but to make the white cast less noticeable, I have some easy recommendations.  Make sure you heat the product by rubbing it on your fingers for 10 to 20 seconds and add a bit of your moisturizer.  And when you apply it to your skin, don't rub it. Apply it in padding motions enough to cover your face, neck, and chest.
I love Cerva products in general, but this sunscreen leaves a white cast on skin plus it is very thick!I add some moisturizer to make things easier.
This does not rub in at all. It looks like I painted my face with white foundation and I'm pretty fair skinned. So disappointed.
I like that this product is an SPF 50 however, I was hoping to be able to wear it under my makeup but it gives me a white mask effect and so that I cannot use it under my makeup.  In the products defense no where does it says that you can use it under makeup,  but I was hoping I could.  I think it should be use alone.
This gives a crazy white cast, is hard to spread on, sits on top of my skin, and doesn't wash off easily. That could all be ok if it actually kept me from burning but it also doesn't seem to do a good job of that! Not worth it :(
I love this face sunscreen! It blends in easily and does not irritate my face. Before I was using a chemical sunscreen and I think it was reacting weird with some of my other skincare products because my face would burn when it was in the sun, but this sunscreen has been incredible! I really love it and is worth every penny.
I like CeraVe products but this is too white and it’s almost impossible to get it to absorb
Bought this sunscreen because it was mineral based & a high SPF protection level for my face/skin which is important for my sensitive skin. However, despite having fairly fair skin myself it makes me look like casper the ghost if I apply the correct amount of sunscreen for protection. I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately only wear it now if I wear a full face of makeup over it so that I can at least finish the bottle without completely wasting my money. If you are looking for a good mineral sunscreen check out CeraVe's 30 SPF mineral sunscreen that has a tint to it - perfect for everyday wear and doesn't leave a terrible white cast.
I have a medium olive complexion and this sunscreen left a pretty bad white cast on my face. I figured maybe rubbing in the product more would help it blend in better, but it didn't. Instead, it roughed up a lot of the dry skin I have on my face making me look flaky and left me with sticky feeling. If I scratch my neck the stickiness transfers over to my finger tips. It's awful. It's also not the easiest to spread around. Such a shame because I normally love CeraVe products, but this one was just a miss for me.
Leaves a white cast on my face. Protects from the sun very well.
This sunscreen is only for the palest of white folks, as it adds a layer of glaring white to your skin. For everyone else with even slightly darker skin, it will make you look like an actual clown, or work as a skin whitening cream, if that's what you're looking for.
I was looking for a high quality, all mineral sunscreen that would not break out my sensitive skin. I have ultra fair skin and can tolerate a lot of white cast in my sunscreen, but this takes the cake. Not in a good way. I tried it over lotion, over fully dry skin, and it it balled up and got streaky every time. I had to throw away the full tube. Would not recommend to anyone, there are far better mineral sunscreens out there. I could not assess the sun protection since I couldn’t get it to evenly apply on my face.
great if you want to look like the ghost of christmas past or uncle fester
Very disappointed with this product. It left a grayish-whitish residue upon application on my face. The product description did not mention that it is tinted. The tint did not disappear even after applying my foundation. Had to wash my face and reapply another sunscreen, the Elta MD which I was hoping to replace with this CeraVe due to price.I guess you truly get what you pay for. I’ve learned my lesson, back to Elta MD…
I use it to protect my face from the florida sun. It seems to block out the damaging rays, but it will leave your face with a white tint.  which as a guyI don’t mind.
This is not light weight, it is so thick, which is fine… Except it left a white film I could knock it off my skin. It made me look like I had face paint on I had to completely wash my face. I couldn’t use it if I needed to go anywhere public. I returned it so disappointing my dermatologist told me it was a good product… But I can’t possibly have a white face. It even got stuck in my hairline and eyebrows and would not come off  this is not light weight, it is so thick, which is fine… Except it left a white film I could knock it off my skin.

I normally CeraVe products, but this is just not it. This leaves a white cast all over my face, is hard to rub in, and it seems to pill as well. I was so excited to try this but it definitely didn’t live up to the hype.
Not hydrating/moisturizing at all, face felt super dry but somehow also greasy. Horrible white cast and pills badly if layered on top of other skincare. Worked fine for body.
I love this product!!! Eventhoug it let a white cast in my face its so nice with my skin....  couple of minutes later and the white cast decreased .... if i need to go out i just put foundation and works perfectly!!!!!!! My skin has improveeeeed so muchhhh because i had some acne because the mask use....
It feels good. It took A LOT to rub it in. Not greasy, which is nice. But it made my face...pink grey? (I'm pretty pale, but wow.) This is NOT for no make up days, and since I don't wear foundation, I guess I'll use it for outdoor activities where feeling "pretty" is irrelevant. There was an old movie called "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" and that's the vibe I got.
I use various CeraVe products and needed extra sun protection to use when going for runs. This sunblock is thick and has a sunblock scent (no added fragrance). It’s perfect for my skin-type (combo), I don’t break-out and I can sweat without it running. Pros: great skin protection and doesn’t block pores. Perfect for days outdoors.  Cons: Thick but spreadable.
It does what it needs to do but is a little thick to put under everyday make up. Definitely a white cast on the skin.
I’m sure this is effective as a sunscreen. I’ve ordered/used  CeraVe sunscreen for my face before. It was SPF 30.  I figured 50 would be even better. Apparently, not the same ingredients. When I put this on, it looked like I had applied Halloween make-up. I’m fairly pale. My father was a redhead. I’ve been wearing facial sunscreen every day of my adult life.  A bit of, is it called, “flash? Flashback?” is fine with me. However, this stuff is crazy! Unless you plan to wear this trick or treating as a skeleton, I’d say pick something else. BTW- I DID apply make-up over this and spent the day in it. It never “melted” in. I just looked different than my normal tone all day.
Makes my skin appear white even when applying evenly. Any sunscreen will do that’s spf50
I read all of the negative reviews saying that the "invisible zinc" leaves a white film or residue, but I decided to ignore them because love Cerave products and figured it was just a few people that were putting it on too thick or something.Nope, wrong. Believe all the bad reviews. Even with a very thin layer (which probably isn't enough to provide adequate sun protection) it left a very visible white cast on my face. Even my 13 yr old kid noticed and asked what was wrong with my face, and he usually never pays attention to what I look like.Unless you are EXTREMELY pale, this stuff is going to make you look like a Victorian Era plague victim.I'm sure it offers good sun protection, so I'll save it for when I'm in the back yard playing with my dogs, as they're they only ones who aren't going to judge me for wearing this.
I usually use Laroche-Posay but tried Cerave’s because I use their cleansers. For one I don’t like the smell of it. It also leaves a very noticeable white cast no matter how much I try to “rub in”.
Leaves a thick white layer on your face. It's really difficult to rub it in enough to make it disappear. I haven't truly tested the sun protection and other features because I've hardly used it for this reason.
The brand is a trusted one by me due to sensitive skin. It felt a little bit 'drier' than I was expecting when I applied it to my face.  Works excellently though.
I apply this in the morning as the last step of my skincare routine. It usually is sitting on top of my vit c serum, eye serum, eye balm, and a day cream like grown alchemist's day cream.I have dry/dehydrated/sensitized acne prone skin. I love that this product spreads easily and blends in nicely. It doesn't give me that lavender cast that many mineral formulations can leave behind on fair skin. The price point makes this a great everyday option for me and I haven't noticed any acne or eczema flare ups from this product. Would definitely recommend.
Will leave your face white and does not spread easily or leaving your skin dry and white . I recommend the SPF 30 more but with this one I apply and a little moisturizer and the sunscreen to apply it easier .
This will leave a white cast, even on pale skin, however, it works rather nicely under foundations.
No matter how little I apply, the sunscreen leaves a white mask all over my face no matter how hard I try rubbing it in. I have darker skin so it's especially visible.
This is to be expected with a mineral based sunscreen but this sunscreen is so chalky and thick to the point you need an absorbent amount to even be effective. Not to mention the horrible white cast regardless of how much of it you use.
Very hydrating, but difficult to spread and thus the white cast is clearly visible. Offers some protection so it requires reapplying every hour or so, but don't exceed two hours. Also, does not cause acne!
The white cast is so so bad!!!
I had heard that this was a great sunscreen. But no one told me that it leaves a white cast. I thought that it could be cause I didn’t rub it in enough but no. After a couple of minutes it becomes hard to run. So the ingredients don’t absorb into the skin easily. I have oily skin so maybe this just isn’t for my face.
It doesn't spread easily, toooooo white, makes you look like a ghost. I feel bad I did not rely on the previous reviews and still ordered it.
Having trouble spreading and rubbing in mineral sunscreen comes with the territory, and I have nothing negative to say about this products ability to protect from sun burns or it's price point.That being said, this is by far the most apparent white cast a mineral sunscreen has ever left on my face. I've used other mineral sunscreens that weren't as obvious, so I wouldn't buy this again.
I have brown skin and this gave me the worst white cast. I cant imagine going out wearing this. It rubs in weirdly too. Pills if you put a bit too much. Forget about reapplying this again and again.
Good sun protection. Con is it leaves a white cast on skin, even when thoroughly blended.
A very easy to spread, start off with a little to get a feel for how it spreads and absorbs.  I found it's definitely moisturizing,  but very white (I have an olive complexion).  Will have to work it in a little,  but even with a mild tinted foundation, my complexion was smooth and color neutral.
was a bit hard to spread and not goo with make up over it
I got the 50SPF because I was unable to find any of the 30SPF anywhere at the time, and this product genuinely sucks.I am a really pale person who adds white to her foundation, and it left such a strong white cast on me. The way it settles forces me to mix it with a bb cream or primer and then put makeup on top. And the formula is so sticky and hard to spread, I don’t even want to attempt rubbing the rest on my hands like I usually do.I can’t even believe this is a CereVe product. I’ve trusted them for years and this product is such a letdown.
Strange purple cast and it was hard to spread evenly throughout skin. Definitely not rebuying
This is actually one of the most difficult to use sunscreens I've tried, especially for the face, and I've used lots of zinc oxide before. And I've never looked so white and shiny. I put foundation on over it and that didn't work. I wanted to like this, but I didn't.  Sorry.
I wanted to like this, instead it turns out I hated it. Doesn’t spread easy, leaves a white cast & accentuate my fine lines & left my skin dry also, it looked like I had a mask on. The worst sunscreen I ever used and I love Cerave products. But this was just the worst.
this stuff is powerful and will definitely leave your skin looking pale
Love thus product line but was hoping for something a little more sheer.
I used everyday and I reapply as necessary, I don't use makeup regularly so I don't know how it's feels with that but regularly I love it.For me one bottle last almost 10 moths or less.
It leaves a white cast on your skin if you use to much but it works.
I am sure it really protects well and that part is awesome, but do not believe you are easily rubbing this sunscreen onto your face and then it disappears. I have a white cast on my face no matter what on the days I wear this sunscreen.
The zinc leaves me caulky
I'm pale - like part redhead pale - so when I read the reviews about the white cast, I thought I was going to be okay. Nope. It's alright if you don't use a lot but then my face burned so, not great. I like the consistency okay but the cast thing is really off-putting considering the price. I like the brand but won't be buying again for the white cast thing alone.
I was exited about trying the sunscreen from this brand but didn’t like it. It leaves a white/ purplelish thick layer on the face and makes my makeup slip right off my face.
I don't know how to feel about this. It is hard to spread around and leaves a white cast all over my face and most of all it's drying.
I bought this hoping to have a better sunscreen that would be OK with my sensitive skin, unfortunately I ended up getting eye irritation from it, by the end of the day my eyes were tired and blurry and got better if I washed the lotion off.  Was also a bit hard to spread and left a white residue, but my skin felt nice and soft all day.
I found this to be greasy and hard to spread on my skin. I have rosacea prone skin that's very fair. THIS IS NOT WATER/SWEAT RESISTANT!!! I cannot wear this under makeup because it would slide right off. I found this to be irritating to my face, but okay on the rest of my body. I did find it moisturizing and soothing on my body, I just couldn't use it on my face. Left a white cast even when rubbed in all the way.
Makes your face white, but provides good coverage and sun protection.
It's a good product but it does leave your skin feeling sticky. :(
I bought this sunscreen because I have sensitive skin and Rosacea. Mineral Sunscreen is much safer for people who are concerned about long-term exposure to chemical ingredients too. I wish I could give a higher rating. I have the Cerave Moisturizing Cream and The Hydrating Facial Cleanser. Those two products work well with my skin condition and I highly recommend those. The Mineral Sunscreen I do not recommend. I also have fair, light skin, and I burn easy.  I'm familiar with Mineral Sunscreen because I've used a spray on kind before. It does leave a pasty white look, so any Mineral Sunscreen needs to be used sparingly. However, this did not massage well into my skin. It caked on and left white residue. With others the color was tolerable, but this is too noticeable and I wouldn't wear this out in public. If you plan to use this, don't wear makeup! It's also a very misleading label. This product is not hydrating what so ever. If anything, it dried my skin out.
Made me whiter than I already am and brought out my flakey skin
Ordered based on reviews, looking for a non irritating sunscreen for summer beach vacation. Although it doesn’t irritate my skin or eyes, it absolutely does not disappear.  I would never wear this in public as it looks like plain zinc.  When my hubby uses it on his face stubble he has a white beard all day.  I do not know how moisturising it is like the label claims.  It does seem to last all day and I have to double cleanse to remove it.
I does its job. Nice product
It goes on dry and leaves a white cast on your face. I even tried using it with another moisturizer. No thanks
Read the reviews and recommendations from "skin" doctors__  DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THEM  This stuff goes on like wet cement.  It doesn't blend out.  It just stands on the skin like a coat of white chalk.  There is no rubbing the stuff in.  It is one terrible product.  Shame on those reviewers and especially shams on dermatologist who recommended this %&*!
The first day using this sunscreen my face was white and sticky. I left it on for couple of hours and it was still the same just my face wasn’t as white but it was still noticeable. So I said to myself, ima just give it a chance. So 3 days passed and this sunscreen is one of the worse products I have ever purchased. The sticky feeling didn’t went away and my face was pale. Everyone is different but this is what I have experienced. I won’t ever buy this product again. I gave it a 1 star because it won’t let me rate it as a 0
My son suffers from sensitivity to the sun, his skin would get red and blotchy.  His doctor recommended this product and I couldn’t believe how great it worked.  He can actually go out in the sun without wearing long sleeves!
I really wanted to like this product, but the white cast it leaves behind is AWFUL! It’s really thick and hard to spread evenly across the face. I’ve liked other Cereve products in the past and wanted to try the face sunscreen. I was hoping it matched to some of their other products but it didn’t come close. Highly Disappointed!
I love the protection. It not made for brown skin. Unless you put a super thin layer.  I use it in the backyard gardening. Also great under a face mask.
It turns your skin white from all of the zinc or whatever in the sunscreen.  Other than that, it's good.
It is a nice protection for skin from sun. When  you try to blend it, it looks all white and like a ghost. It does not blend in with skin at all.
Works well. Spreads most easily if one mixes it with an oil or lotion. Without the oil or lotion to mix, it does leave my skin (asian) a little white.
The white cast is very prominent and never fully goes away even after lots of running in. The feel is meh. Tacky to the touch. Good sun protection, high SPF. But I won’t be getting this again. When I get a new sunscreen for my face I’ll use this for my body so I doesn’t go to waste.
I would have given this more stars if not for the fact that I look like I've never seen the light of day after putting this on. Does it work? Yes. Does it do what it says it does? Yes. Do I look like a ghost? Yes. I only wear this under makeup, which is fine. It works well as a primer. But I can't just throw this on and go out, which is what I want in a sunscreen, especially during the summer.
It protects you from the sun but it makes my skin feel greasy and it leaves behind on obvious white surface on your face.
Easy to over apply!  Now I apply it before going to the beach!  A small amount goes a long way!
I am Latina and would consider myself a coffee with milk complexion, maybe even a shade darker. The regular sunblocks look ridiculous on me. There’s that white film that you can’t seem to rub in to your skin. This goes on very smoothly and feels nice.
It leaves a terrible white cast on my face! I am planning to use it only on days I'm staying at home.
I typically like this brand. So I trusted to buy the sunblock For my face.I’ve used it 2days in a row and got breakouts. Pore clogging.This sunblock is difficult to spread in. Leaving your face purple well depending on your skin tone. I’ll stick to their lotion.
It does the job but it leaves a white layer over the skin no matter how much I rub it in, feels a bit heavy.
good sun protection but it doesnt spread nicely at allllll and irs so white my face looks bad after using it
I’m not sure I love this product. It was very hard to apply. Does not spread on well like normal lotion. It dries fast and then gets tacky. My face felt sticky. I even washed it again and started over; same result. I’ve had it on all day and my face doesn’t feel dry. Feels like it took a long time to absorb. I didn’t try to put any makeup on top of it her, either.
I’ll be honest I didn’t read the mineral part, I am sure this is a great product for lighter skin individuals because for dark skin people you’ll end up looking white/purple looking 😂😂 so that’s why it has the low ratings for me.
Sun protection is good but the white color is horrible. There's no smearing it in. The whiteness just sits on top of your skin...
Love this sunscreen!  Would have given a five stars if it doesn’t leave a white cast.
Usually love Cerave products but this one was not okay for my family. It left white film on my family’s skin and was a bit of an eyesore. In search for another sunscreen that won’t make our skin white.
I used a small amount of product and it left a thick, white, greasy film. Looked like I was wearing a white mask, and my skin is pale to begin with. Had to wash off right away. I’m returning it as it’s unwearable.
If you are not damn near translucent this leave a noticeable white cast. I'm East African and deep brown, if you're anywhere near my skin tone DO NOT BUY!
For me this is lotion is very difficult to blend in.  I have to use it sparling in order for it to get absorbed.  I also tried the 30spf and it blends in much better for me.
for some reason i didn’t even think twice about buying mineral sunscreen, but every time i put this on i look like that one picture of mark zuckerburg surfing at the beach. the dusty white layer it leaves on your face is impossible to rub in so you’re left looking like you’re wearing cheap foundation 10 shades too light. does the job, but at what cost? definitely buying new sunscreen asap because this stuff just isnt it for me.
Lotion never rubbed into the skin, white face thru the entire hike but it did protect my skin.
I've tried on dry skin and right after applying aloe vera. This sunscreen does not absorb well into the skin. And it feels like it flakes/balls up. White flecks come off. My face looks like a ghost when using this.
Very disappointed by this. I religiously use cerave face cream every AM/PM, so thought this would be awesome as well. It’s not - I can’t speak to how well it protects your skin or whether it’ll cause breakouts because the worst thing about it is that it leaves an awful white cast behind that you can’t rub in! I thought, based on some other reviews, that I just had to wait and it would settle in and look normal again, but that never happened. Came back inside after hours in my yard and scared myself in the mirror from how ghoulishly pale I still looked (I am already fairly pale, so that was no small feat).Save your money - this is a complete waste. I ended up buying and loving Blue Lizard sensitive skin sunscreen as a superior alternative to this. I would highly recommend that brand instead, as it actually blends in and protects well.
I use CereVe products and was anxious to get this sunscreen.  Before using, I read all the instructions etc on how to apply. I have spent a whole week trying to apply the sunscreen so that it would not leave my face with a white residue. I could not get it to happen even when I mixed in a little of my foundation to give it a tint.  In order for it not to leave a white residue, I would have to use such a little amount of sunscreen that I don't think it would be ample for protection. I'm feel confident that it will give good protection if one doesn't care about a white residue. Would not recommend for the face
This doesn’t fade well. Hard to blend in. Expect to look sickly pale lol
This is the kind of sun protection that leaves a white cast across the skin. Does not soak into the skin.
i still burned in the sun and i still gets some reaction on my skin due to this cream
This sunscreen gives an awful white cast no matter how much you try to rub the product onto your face. Do not buy this and save the $12-$13 towards a different sunscreen.
Sooooo - this is NOT a good product for daily life If you‘re looking for an absorbent, invisible product to wear under your makeup.  On my medium light skin tone, this product leaves my skin looking purply-greyish.
The consistency is way too thick and hard to spread but is moisturizing
I’m a pale person and this white cast is very severe
I’m SUPER pale and this even left a terrible white cast on me. It made my eyes and teeth look like mustard lol. Even after rubbing it in and wiping it off..Definitely do not recommend.
I like cerave products but not this one. It left an icky white cast.
It leaves such a white cast, it doesn't go away.  Even with makeup, my face looks white!  WHITE!!
this moisterizer  does a good job for the price.  It doesnt feel greasy....
Listen. I am a VERY pale person. Besides being so pale, this somehow gave me the WORST white cast I’ve ever experienced with any sunscreen in my life. Given my experience i would assume this sunscreen would definitely not work for POC.It is horrible. I’m shocked because Cera Ve is usually so reliable! I usually use glossier’s sunscreen (highly recommend) but i wanted to try this because it’s $10 less for much more product. I understand why now. Do not buy. I will be trying return this.
The problem is the usual with Mineral sunscreens,that whiteness that we all have to deal with. It's  hard to wear.
I put this on after my moisturizer and the white cast this caused has made me make the decision to never use it again. As a black man, I don’t think this is for melanated folk.
I personally love cerave products, but this sunscreen is hard to spread and leaves a thick paste on my skin. It’s good for if I’m going to be in the sun, but I don’t like the way it looks on me personally.
Very greasy and makes your face look pale but is easy to apply, moisturizing, and protective
It works and doesn't cause breakouts on me. It leaves a white cast on my skin that I don't love though.
This is ok.. it does leave skin with a white residue. It definitely doesn’t feel moisturizing and a bit hard to spread
Make sure to put lotion on BEFORE using. Putting on lotion before helps it spread evenly without giving you a pasty white face. This is basic skincare info. Do not let the other reviews set you back from this awesome SPF! Just USE MOISTURIZER!!
I’m on Curology for my acne and due to my skin being weakened by the treatment, I have to limit sun exposure to my face. This cream won over my heart. I love the smell and the feel of it. Great face protection!Only con - make sure you spread it good across your face because the cream is extremely white unless it’s rubbed in thoroughly.
This left a white cast all over my face no matter how little I used. The white cast would seem to fade except around the nose and fine lines - then white would stick around all day. Would not recommend.
Great sunscreen but does not rub in all the way.
Hahaha I am super pale, and yes I put this in a little thicker than some because I burn in the sun… but come on! Even makeup can’t cover this! It’s also super drying. I’ll stick to Lancôme, even though it’s way more $. This is the worst!
This sunscreen provides good protection/coverage, but you will look like a ghost. It is impossible to run in this sunscreen.
As we all know, pretty terrible white cast. It's a straight up 100% zinc oxide sunscree. But it's mostly emollient and feels protecting albeit because you can see and feel exactly where it is. It's better for the body if you really mind the grey/blue of it all.
I typically love everything Cerave makes and while this sunscreen does feel great no burning or stinging at all it does not blend in easily. I have spent the last 10 minutes rubbing my face and still leaves so much white residue on my face.
Amazing but it does go on like normal sunscreen not like lotion! It is thick so a little goes a long way! If you want to wear this under makeup be sure to mix a moisturizer in it because its thick and heavy!
I thought it would be thin and moisturizing to be able to wear everyday while on the go  but it was super thick just like a beach sunscreen or thicker, left my children's face white with a thick layer, never absorbed. Not what I thought at all when I read the label. This is regular sunscreen for the beach.
I don’t know about sun protection but what I do know is this product is so hard to rub into your skin it leaves a white film on your face that just stays there.  I’ve tried using just a dab and no difference.Not a fan.I’ve used the other Cerave sunscreen with retinol and that worked great.  I had no issues except for the cost. I learn my lesson I will spend a little more to get the better product.
When you first put it on it’s obvious and cakey but it dries very quickly into the skin and lasts all day if you’re not super sweaty. I use it every morning and i love it.
Listen Black and white people alike, this sunscreen was not made for any of us. First of it turns black people into blueberries and white people into ghosts. It's very difficult to rub into skin, and does not settle. I've been blue for 5 hours now. I pray it comes off when I wash my face. Do not spend money on this unless you need to look like a purple blueberry or a white ghost for Halloween.
I have an olive complexion and this product has a severe white cast. It is very very thick and is a bit greasy to apply. As I was applying it, it became evident that this would not be the product for me. I put it on thinking that perhaps I could work it into the skin and it would disappear. It did not. I ended up leaving it on as I had no plans to go out and to see if it might absorb after a bit of time. Nope. All day, as I would periodically check, what would great me in the mirror looked like something that had failed out of psycho-mime school. Washing it off proved to be something of a chore as well.If you’re all darker complected, look elsewhere.
leave white cast hard to rub in ..
Pros- Good for people with light skin- Expiration dateCons- Hard to spread on the face- Hard to blend in- Not a good absorbent
I bought this to wear as a daily spf using with or without makeup. I prefer mineral formations as to chemical. I’ve used many in the past successfully, not so here. I made the mistake of assuming the “face” in the title would be similar to others I’ve used. This is incredibly thick, pasty, chalk white paste that was very hard to spread. It gathers terribly around eyebrows, if you have fuller brows expect a problem. I also had issues with it sitting on the skin no matter how much I tried to blend and spread it. I’m pretty sure it would work fine as a simple sun barrier if you don’t mind the above for-mentioned issues. Depending on the attributes you may be looking for I think this is valuable info. I wouldn’t recommend this at all to anyone, let alone anybody looking to wear this under makeup. Hopefully this helps somebody.
I tried. I really did. I even watched the how to video. It is still terribly pasty, hard to blend, sticky, and leaves a severe white cast. I’m a pale redhead so I’m usually ok with sun blocks that are too white for other people. Not this one. The only thing I can use it for is if they want to remake the movie The Ring and they need someone to play a Japanese ghost. Two stars because it does its job as a sunblock and doesn’t sting your skin.
Horrible product that will leave you with white residue all over your skin that’s impossible to rub in. This is especially the case if you’re a person of color. Avoid at all costs it will have you looking crazy.
Not buying again. Leaves extremely white residue that does NOT absorb into the skin. Very disappointed
Since it is mineral based, presumably not much danger of toxicity. No smell, but it does have you looking somewhat ghost like. Recent information indicates ingredients in most suntan lotions can cause cancer.
I really wanted to like this product but I had a hard time doing so. When you put it on, it shows up so white on your face that you can’t wear it without makeup on top. The problem is, when you do put makeup on top, it doesn’t work together and rubs right off. If you barely sweat, the product also comes off. Not waterproof either. I’m not exactly sure who this product would work for. I guess if you are in a cool, dry environment and don’t mind a neon white face. Don’t go for the product only for the brand name. I learned my lesson!
Mon-greasy, a little thick. White cast not as bad as other brands. Okay under makeup. A little medicinal smell, but not terrible
Won’t be buying this again. Bought it to wear daily and it’s far too thick and leaves you looking very “Casper”. I also am breaking out because it’s so thick.
it comes out white! not much needed to use , would only recommend under makeup! its moisturizing though
Its too thick for me for my face and I looked like a ghost. it does the job of sun protection, but I didn't like the feel to it and usually I am a fan of Cerave products.
i dont know how good is covering the sun but it leaves a white coat on the face.
Will make your face have a very white tint. Doesn’t blend in wel
This doesn’t absorb well and leaves a white film  on my skin.
I was really hoping to like this and incorporate in my daily routine but it leaves a noticeable white hue on my skin. I have tan skin and when I apply this it doesn’t spread easily so it’s hard to blend in and it leaves my face looking caked. I do like that it’s not oily. I normally don’t wear makeup so the white hue it leaves is very noticeable. It also has a strong sunblock smell throughout the day. Hours after I apply it people can still smell it on me. Sorry but it’s a no from me.
I’m not sure how this got pass quality control. It leaves a HORRIBLE white caste & is very drying. Look elsewhere.
I generally love CeraVe and have used numerous products from the brand for years. This SPF is not among those products. Truly one of the worst wearing sunscreens I’ve ever used. It’s thick and sits on top of the skin, is very difficult to rub in, and leaves a  cakey white cast, even on my very pale skin. I’m sure the white mask it leaves protects well from the sun, but I’ll never know for sure because I wouldn’t leave the house with this cakey mess on my face.
Leaves a heavy white cast. Not great for every day use. Especially for brown skins
leaves you looking very white if you don’t rub it in a LOT. and i mean a LOTTTTTTT.
Very disappointed. Even though the sun protection is amazing, blending this is almost impossible unless you're very pale. I can't wear this without looking like a joke. And I refuse to wear a little amount of this to look decent as I would be giving up on a full sun protection. I'll be using this on my arms and legs. Don't buy it. 😞
This may be a good sunscreen as far as protection goes but I don’t like it because it leaves a white layer on my face that looks terrible. It doesn’t absorb all the way.
Leaves a stain that makes you look very pasty. I was hoping for a blendable sunscreen I could wear everyday but this was a little bit too thick for that
While this item may provide sun protection, it does not absorb into the skin very well. It leaves a white film on the face and makes me to look very pale as a result. Not impressed with this product.
First- it has a scent- and not a good one.Does not spread as well as Elta- this is what I get for trying to save money.Super thick. Your face will have a WHITE flim all over it no matter how much time you spend trying to rub it in.Just no
It’s great that it has SPF50 but it leaves white cast on my face. I look like I’ve seen a ghost. lol Giving this away.
Make no mistake.  This is for serious sun-blocking, and yes, it tends to leave a noticeable white film when it's applied.  When I am exercising in hot, humid weather, this product does not burn the eyes when I sweat, and that makes it better than any of the sports sunscreens I have used.
I applied this every 30 minutes on the beach. Left a horrible white cast, did not spread evenly and i got a HORRIBLE burn on my face, so bad that my skin is swollen and i was not out from underneath my umbrella for very long. Do not recommend
It is good a sunscreen, however, is no easy to spread and it leaves a white cast that is not nice.
This is awful.You know I’ve heard so much about this that I wanted to buy it but it turns out I have a dark skin tone and this product leaves a heavily white cast. Like unbelievable. I don’t like it and I have to mixed it with something else, plus it feels so dry, I don’t feel like it’s moisturizing my skin, it’s actually pretty dry.
Live in Florida and I’m out doors a lot. Love this sunscreen. Great value, good for sensitive skin with no harsh chemicals I recommend it to all my family and friends.
Not easy to spread on the face, leaves you a white cast.
Nice texture but still leaves a white cast
Does it turn your skin ghost white? Yes. Does it feel like you're wearing a rubber mask? Kind of. Do you feel super-well protected from the sun while you're at the beach? Heck, yeah.
Cerave is goat but this leaves you looking like a mime
It leaves a whitish tiny but really good product
This sunscreen leaves a terribly visible white tint on your skin.
Really hard to rub into your face and has a bad white cast.
Good protection but this specific one has very bad white cast and made my face look much more pail than the rest of me but it did do it’s job
Would not recommend to absolutely anyone, especially those of darker skin tones. Nothing like other CeraVe products, it leaves this ghostly tint on your skin and as you can clearly see it also caused a severe allergic reaction on my face after washing it off (with my usual CeraVe Face wash that is) will never buy again.
I thought I'd be okay as a pale white girl with this moisturizer but holy cow, this white cast is no joke. Wish I had read the reviews before buying instead of trusting the overall rating. Oh well. Would not recommend for anyone, even my fellow pasty folks.
I really enjoy this sunscreen. I'm really sensitive to sunscreen and often get rashes and acne, but with this I don't. The only think I recommend is to mix a small amount with moisturizer because it has a very WHITE tint.
So far finally a sunscreen that protects my skin from sun spots. It is hard to get the white to disappear, so I top it off with a bit of my makeup, problem solved.
I have been using it for the past one weeks. The product is very thick and has to be rubbed in completely or it leaves a pinkish film on your face.
The white cast was so intense that I had to wipe some off. Not easy to spread at all and it left my skin feeling sticky.
White plaster on the face. Immediately. I dabbed a very small amount, applied to face: embarrassingly chalk white all over. Impossible to blend. I threw it out. Not even worth returning. Did NOT expect that for a Cera Ve product, I’m disgusted. I thought formulas have come a long way since early 90s, guess this one hasn’t. Time to update to a more blend-able formula.
Like the protection but I have to use oil or cream first to be able to spread it. Leaves a white film otherwise.
Too thick. And heavy Leaves white sheen.  Not happy with it
This doesn’t really get absorbed into the skin and now my face is considerably whiter...almost joker makeup like. I am sure it is great barrier from the sun but it isn’t natural looking.
I had really high hopes for this sunscreen but unfortunately was left disappointed. I would suggest this for people with extremely oily skin because it is so difficult to spread across your face. It left a severe white cast and caused pilling. I'm on top of my skin care game so I already moisturize my face and everything, even with excess amount of moisturizer my skin was left feeling dry.
It feels nice, but it looks terrible! The first time I applied “liberally” as per instructions (maybe a third of a teaspoon), and it looked like I was wearing white face paint. I saw the other review for this product and tried again with less product, but as I kept rubbing it did fade, but also microexfoliated my face and sort of crumbled, so it looks kind of cakey and I’m still much paler. I’m already pretty pale but this is quite noticeable. This would REALLY not work for anyone who isn’t very very fair in skin tone. It does *feel* much nicer than any other sunscreen I’ve used, so two stars.
I’m olive skin toned and this was the hardest sunscreen to apply. It wouldn’t absorb into my skin. I waited 3o minutes before I went outdoors and still I had a white film over my face.
Leaves behind a very thick white tint no matter how hard you try to rub it in. If you put makeup over it it’s fine but without it it looks awful. Also smells bad.
I love this product but be careful not to put to much on. Trust me when I say a little bit goes a long way. Works really well. Not sticky at all very smooth on skin and has a nice texture. I highly recommend to buy this product.
This sunscreen does not rub into your skin very well and leaves you as white as a ghost. I have fair skin and even a tiny amount left me looking ridiculously pale.
Product arrived with a expiration date three months away. Could have gone to Grocery Outlet if I wanted dated stock.
So unfortunate. Really wanted to try this but the first red flag was that the box had looked a bit beaten up and slightly opened already. I had hoped maybe it was just the box that was bad but when I opened the actual product- it appears there is no covering over the opening, which means it has already been used.
Leaves a white cast
I genuinely do love this brand and what they have to offer.However when it comes to their sunscreens i find it is not fit for all skin tones/types.I applied a small dot of the amount and it left a white cast.After a certain amount of time trying to rub it in, it became sticky and stiff.I do recommend a moisturizer  that has spf or one without a white cast,.
Works great! It’s color is noticeable on the skin however.
Leaving a white cast is the only issue
don't like how it leaves skin white
Goes on like paste.
A little too white for day use
This thing dose not have hyaluronic acid as the info
No matter how much I try to rub it in definitely makes my skin very pale with a little bit of a hue of blue to it. :/ it looks awkward if you don't plan on putting foundation on over it.
Pros: good sun protectionCons: too much would leave your face with a residue sorta and doesn't spread on face easily kind of stickyNot sure if it moisturizes wellSince I use a cerave moisturizer before the sunscreen.I just didn't like that it left my face (even with a little sunscreen) with like a white ish lookMaybe with a tinted sunscreen it would be better
This is a great sunscreen that kept us from burning in Hawaii. It makes your face a little bit white but does its job as it's supposed to.
I have purchased MANY sunscreen products and cannot tell you how many say they are not greasy … this one is not ☺️
Why would someone design a product for the face and then said product changes the color of your face to death white and it does not go away for the whole day.
It stays really "white" seems to not absorb easily
Feels like i'm spreading elmers glue on my face. It stays on for a long time so that's good. But I will continue my hunt for a sunscreen that is lightweight.
So this makes me look like a different race. It makes my face sooo light and I HAVE to put foundation on my face after because then my face is different from my overall skin tone. It feels dry when putting it on and it’s hard to spread around my face. I’m young like in my 20’s and my skin gets pulled to and fro when putting this on. Scared it will create wrinkles...
If you want to look like this after applying the instructed amount of sunscreen, feel free to spend your money on it.It was my first disappointing product from Cerave.
Fighting skin cancer on my face and neck!  The sun protection is great. I love the ease of application and it’s moisturizer has been so much help!
I put a dime size or maybe even less on and my face stayed white
As someone who is already, uh, over-served with shine and whiteness, this product is a dud. The formula is thick and paste-like, and spreads poorly. If it won't blend into my pasty mug, it's not going to work for most folks. I'll be using it for the backs of my hands pre-bike-ride until is runs out.
I love Cerave products, but this one is horrible. I expected some white cast because this is a mineral sunscreen, but usually the white cast fades on me after a few minutes.  I have light skin so white cast is usually this is not a problem, but this one does not fade.  It made me look like a ghost until I took it off eight hours or so later.  Also, there is a strange smell, kind of like gasoline, when you first put it on.  It fades or I go "nose blind" after a few minutes, but it is there whenever I use this product. I've tried three times and I think I'm done.  My recommendation is to skip this one until it's reformulated or  unless you like the "white-nosed" lifeguard look all over your face.
I am 64 years old with mature somewhat dry skin.  I currently use Isdin Erfotona Actinica SPF50 and really like it. With winter coming I thought I would try a more hydrating sunscreen and chose this one.  It will not absorb into my skin. It streaks across my face.
I would not buy it again. I have to mix it with lotion in order to spread it around and it still makes me look like a ghost. I’ve never had that issue but It’s like trying to spread peanut butter in your face. I do like that it doesn’t cause any rashes for sensitive skin
This was one of the worst sunscreens I have ever used. It felt like rubbing thick chalk lotion w/ sand (I have normal/ combination skin) onto my face & it looked absolutely terribly on without even putting makeup on top of it. I would honestly hate  to even think or try to layer it with how chalky thick & dry this was like a sandy paste on my face. I can’t speak for how well it worked because I was not going out in public looking like that. I really wanted to love this but ended up having to removed this w/ a makeup wipe because of the consistency. Absolute no from me and I’m very pale so the fact it was too thick & too white for me is a lot.  Save your money and buy something else!
This stuff sucks I put it on and it was greasy but no cast came back to the mirror an hout later I looked like I was dead then I thought my makeup would cover it it turned my makeup yellow and my face was glowing and I am a very light skinned so tnis is a no 4 all shades of ppl..
I have acne prone skin and this sunscreen is amazing. I've used Lancome and Clinique facial sunscreens for years (and at 3x the cost). I recently switched to Cerave and am very satisfied. I had no issues after several uses and the price is excellent for the high quality.
This sunscreen is best for people with light skin. I use it everyday. My daughter is olive skinned and tan and it leaves too much chalky cast for her. For me it works beautifully. It protects me from the sun, moisturizes my skin really well and doesn’t irritate my face at all. I recommend it if your skin is fair enough to handle the zink cast, it is unnoticeable on me but very distracting on my darker skinned daughter
Nice product, but you end up looking a bit goth due to the whiteness of the sunscreen. So, good for the beach, but not to wear daily unless you want to look goth.
This sunscreen did protect my face from the sun, which is obviously great, however it really does leave a major white cast which all other reviews state as well. I honestly though that people were just being delicate, but it is so thick and difficult to spread out, which makes it hard to rub in the whiteness. It also made my makeup start to ball up. I’ll wear it if I’m not wearing any makeup and I’m swimming or hiking and need really good protection, but definitely not a daily face spf.
I wanted to love this sunscreen so much, like I love my other cerave products. But this product is so thick and tacky that it’s hard to spread, and it leaves the worst white cast I’ve ever seen. I literally looked like a ghost after trying to massage it in for over a minute. Not only that but it made my face break out in massive under the skin zits. The only pro is that it does its job of protecting my skin from the sun.
I generally like and use many ceraVe products. However I have been disappointed with this. It has a physical sunblock with SPF 50 which is what I was looking for; however it is very thick and does not rub in. It leaves a significant white cast on my face. I have been using a small amount mixed in with foundation make up which seems to diminish the whiteness. I will use it like this however I will not purchase again.
I had high hopes for this sunscreen but I have wasted my money. It was not easy to rub in and  left a white caste on my face. Had me looking like a clown. Save your money and get a sunscreen that is inclusive.  If I could give zero ratings I would.
It did not spread easily and I felt like I was tugging at my skin roughly. It's a very drying product too.
Even for a paper-white person like myself, this leaves a VERY obvious white-cast. Also, would not recommend for oily skin.
I was excited about this product but it made my skin look super past even after rubbing it in for minutes and letting it settle into my skin. It highlights all of my dry areas instead of moisturizing them and is just generally a huge let down looks wise. I'm sure it protects me from the sun but I'm v disappointed.
Good, but didn’t quite liked the fact that it’s hard to spread.
Feels heavy and thick. But its sunscreen so it's okay
major white cast but overall good I guess
This doesn't work for me, leaves a white cast.
Though it does leave a white cast, it does not sting my eyes, which I am very happy about.
VERY WHITE
This is the worst face sunscreen I have ever used.  It won’t absorb or spread.  It leaves your face white.  Like you painted your face.  Terrible.
The cream smells like the plastic container that it comes in. Not terribly pleasant if you put on your face. Also, being a mineral sunscreen, it is opaque - white.
It’s difficult to blend it and it leaves a white cast all over my face. I could never leave me house with it on.
This mineral sunscreen does leave a cast, but if you have fair skin like I do, it doesn’t show too much. It easily spreads on damp skin after washing my face. Love the high spf as well.
Very creamy, goes on easy and protects well. Thanks!!
Should have atleast noted that product is expiring in 3 months. I got two and both are expiring 1/21
If you have brown skin, this is not for you. It leaves a bad white cast behind. I have tried rubbing it in and it still leaves a white cast behind. If you wear it under makeup it might be fine but I don’t like to wear makeup on daily basis esp to cover white cast from sunscreen. Disappointed for sure.
Love it
I tried this sunblock a couple of times and it left a significant white cast.  My skin tone is pale so can't imagine how it would look on deeper skin tones.  I waited to see if it soaked in after a few hours and disappeared.  It didn't  Further rubbing resulted in the product pilling off my skin.  I love Cerave products in general but this one is not for me.  The consistency is a fairly thick cream and that may be part of the problem. It actually felt dry on my skin.
It’s easy to spread but it’s annoying cuz I bought two and both are about to expire
Don't get me wrong, I love Cera-Ve! But the sunscreen is harder to rub in, it makes you look a lot paler and leaves a weird shine on my face that looks unhealthy. Less is more with this product, a small dab on your finger goes a long way, but I definitely expected better.
Did not like this product. It was white on my face!
It's a good product, but don't layer too thick or you will look like a clown who spent too long in the heat.
I was looking for something that doesn’t leave a white cast but I literally look like a ghost
What can I say? I’m cheap. I should’ve read the reviews before buying it. I was so exited to use it, that I applied it while running errands. Had to go back home to wash my ghost face. Some friends said I looked like Sammy Sosa, a Geisha (which is kind of cool) among other characters that aren’t just me.
It was not easy to spread on my skin. It felt heavy and greasy. The smell of it wasn’t very pleasant it smells like I got sent a bad batch. I really like the other products but this one I will not be buying again.
Extremely hard to rub in and will definitely leave a white cast.
Leaves the whitecast. Still love it for my off days. Very effective and non comedogenic. Also moisturizing without greasiness. It is a bit thick though.
So thick esp for face.
I really love this! I feel moisturized when I put it on. It doesn’t make me oily at all. I really like this!!!! I’m thankful that I found it. I’m newly diagnosed with rosacea and I really have to start protecting my skin. I’m glad that I found this product.
I haven’t been able to speak to the sun protection because I haven’t tried it yet, I just wish I’d paid more attention to the reviews saying it makes your face white and is difficult to apply. I don’t want to waste it, so I mix a tiny bit of this with my CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion and it goes on easier. I wouldn’t recommend buying this product alone, it goes on white and it makes my face feel dry.
Please do not ignore the reviews that tell you this product does not rub in well, and that it leaves a white cast on your face.  I thought I could get away with that, as I'm quite fair.  But no amount of rubbing gets this product to absorb into your face.  As such, you will be left with a skim coat on your face that will peek through any makeup you may have on, and highlight any pores you may have.  My daughter kept looking at me and telling me I had something on my face.  It is incredibly hard to remove from your skin, but will rub off easily on clothes or furniture if any is left on your hands after application.  Nor does it feel moisturizing at all.  My skin felt incredibly dry and flaky after using it.  I need a very high spf product due to skin cancer issues, but this is definitely not the one.
All of the attributes; sun protection and easy to spread at a fair price. I trust the brand and this formula is what I want.
This stuff was terrible. It turned my face purple! I looked like Violet on Willy Wonka. I thought if I kept rubbing it in it would eventually blend. Nope! Then I tried putting makeup over it. Nope! Just, don’t do it. I should have read reviews…
The cream difficult to spread and overall very drying to my face even leaving cast.
This sunscreen is like applying a thick white paste that dries out your skin.
Mmmm no ma’am. I look like a gross sister.
leaves a white cast hard to spread.  not breatable.  not for under makeup
Honestly it's a really great product except that it is extremely white on the face. It's easily spreadable, very light weight and keeps my face feeling hydrated all day. The only downside is that I have medium to tan skin tone and this makes me look like a ghost. No matter how much I rub it in, it leaves my face looking ashy. So if you're my skin tone or darker, this product is no bueno.
I should have read the reviews before I bought this but I had faith in this brand.This sunscreen gives you the worst white cast, it’s impossible to even go out in public with it because it looks like you’re wearing white face paintThe product won’t spread easily at all and is just overall terrible 👎🏽
This product worked well on my very sensitive skin.  Comfortable and not greasy.
The cream is very thick, not easily spread.  Leaves white cast on skin making me look ghostly.
I hate it so much. The only nice thing I have to say about it is that it didn’t hurt my sensitive skin. The white cast is so bad that it’s comparable to white Halloween face paint. It has a rubbery texture that pills if you touch your face or try to put makeup over it.
The only thing I don’t like about the sunscreen is that it makes your face white! No amount of rubbing it in helps the white issue!
I didn’t actually try the product since the package was ripped open and cream looked as if it had been used.
my skin looks and feels so much better after using cerave, i can't use any other product after using this one!
I'm pretty white already so I don't need my sunscreen helping me out in that department. I tried to rub it in but it was so hard, I ended up irritating my face. I didn't get burnt that day though so 🤷
Gives a white cast and isn’t easy to spread on its own. Not super moisturizing either.
It’s not easy to spread. It doesn’t blend quickly. You have to put it on and wait for your skin to absorb it. If your pale AF go for it. You have ANY melanin in your skin, congrats we get 10 minutes of privilege with this sunscreen.
It’s thick so it’s a little harder to win but it definitely kept my face from getting burnt when I was in Mexico!
Streaky following applicationHave not felt the moisturizing effectAfter an application the “ white” part of the zinc remains
Doesn’t blend but whatever. As long as it protects my kiddo it works.
I live in Minnesota , can't give an honest review until next summer when we spend hours on the lake fishing and swimming.
It leaves a white cast, which I don’t like. I wish they did something to it because besides that it’s very moisturizing to the skin which I do love that!!!! Overall is a nice product. Don’t use a lot and you’ll be able to camuflaje the white cast.
The white cast on this sunscreen is so bad! I had applied and then called my mom on FaceTime and I looked like a clown. It might be better if you have lighter skin, but it just didn’t work for me.
Had to return, it made my face look whiter than a ghost and wouldn’t rub in. There’s definitely better product out there.
Good product but keep in mind that it leaves a white film on your face
Translate review to English
Love the sun protection but I just could t get the sunscreen rubbed in enough to disappear
I read MANY reviews before buying which indicated this product would leave a white cast, make you look like a ghost, very pale etc. I should have trusted them. I used this for three consecutive days trying harder to blend each day - today I tried to mix it with my moisturizer in hopes of avoiding the white cast but NOPE. The description also indicates, "We suggest applying a small amount in the palm of your hands and rubbing them together. Then, apply to one area of the face at a time, rubbing well. The formula should spread easily leaving a lightweight, non-greasy feel." I tried this, too. Still leaves a very apparent white cast/purple color if you're darker skinned and it stays there pretty much all day (unless you sweat off some of the sunscreen). Expected more from Cerave, as I use their other products.
Nothing to like , dislike that it doesn’t dissolve in your face , your face stays white the hole day .
The product has a completely white effect on my face, it's not pleasant. Very bad.
Bought as substitute for neutrogena face sunblock. Figured CeraVe was superior product/brand. Leaves white residue that does Not absorb or disappear over time. Cannot wear  unless planing to cover with makeup or cc cream to cover up obvious white finish. Skip this. Try another sunblock
This product works but it leaves a terrible white cast on your face. I expected this to an extent because it is a mineral sunscreen, but I didn’t realize my face would be a purply-white color even with makeup on top.
I look ridiculous, like a mime that doesn't have the skills to apply makeup properly. The effectiveness of this "face sunscreen" is essentially pointless because the product is unwearable on the face. For reference, I have a medium-light skin tone.
Idk how this is in the sun because I never made it out the door. Yes I know mineral sunscreen is very opaque and dry but since this is for your face I thought it would be a little more moisturizing. I even mixed a little with a light moisturizer and ew, very pilly.
I like this sunscreen  but I look like ghost  after the white in it is crazy
I have light skin and 12 hours after applying it still looked like I was wearing a white mask.  It’s very hard to spread and gets globed up in your eyebrows. Flakes and clumps up when you try to cover it with makeup. I wear light foundation and it’s not thick enough to cover the white cast. I bought this because I had a tube of their old product that had a “invisible zinc” on the label liked it a lot and couldn’t find the exact product again so decided to give this a try. I don’t know how anyone likes this lotion.
The white cast is very hard to get rid of, specially for someone with a medium complexion.
felt nice and smooth on face and great protection, but left white chalky feeling and appearance
Got due to light skin and help prevent skin cancer
The only reason I  gave it 3 stars is because the sunscreen smells bad.
This particular sunscreen looks white on your skin and it’s difficult to blend.
I received the sunscreen in the box.  I removed the sunscreen and recycled the box.  When I went to use the sunscreen it did not have a silver seal on the top that would make sure the product had not been tampered with.Is this normal ?!?!
Leaves a significant white cast on me and it makes my face very shiny. For reference I'm Asian with light/medium skin tone.
I returned this product but love the brand. When applying to face it left white residue. Maybe it would soak in but I did not like this product. I am going back to my favorites face sunscreen by SkinCeuticals tinted mineral.
Well it did prevent me from getting burned, however the zinc in the product made me look ghostly and it wouldn't rub in to my natural color at all, had to wash it off to look normal again.
Works great to protect your skin however it does leave a white residue
Does not blend in to skin! Looked like a ghost
I’m looking for tips to make this blend in. I don’t do not even see the point of reapplying if I can see the  particles on my skin still. That’s the good news about this sunscreen -sun protection. I guess it’s good quarantine sunscreen because nobody will be seeing me look like I saw a ghost. But I did see a ghost when I looked in the mirror, that is how white I am wearing this sunscreen.
This product is pretty good sunscreen wise but it had a really bad white cast. I would not recommend if you are a person of color. It makes you look pasty and looks like a foundation that is 10x too light for your skin.
It's not soft, it's heavy.  I looked like a ghost. Horrible
My dermatologist recommended CeraVe sunscreen 50 SPF for my face following blue light treats for skin cancer. I have been using it for the past two weeks. The product is very thick and has to be rubbed in completely or it leaves a pinkish film on your face. I am very pleased with the results after using this cream. Better than most other sunscreen products.
As much as I wanted to like this product, it does not spread easily. It leaves a white film and will not blend into the skin. I do not recommend it.
Are you kidding? I read so many derm reviews of this saying it was a great sunscreen, and on top of that I have very fair skin, so I figured it might not be too bad. no no. Cera ve are you kidding? who wants their face to look like this. It clings to EVERY SINGLEEEEEE IMPERFECTION and ANNYYYYYYY texture on your face like heavy makeup, you'll look like you're wearing maybelline dream matte mouse on your face in the shade "dead ghost". Maybe its good for like wearing on the beach or in intense sun if it's such a good sunscreen, but no way could you wear this everyday. BIG NO
Lotion is thick but great protection against the sun.
Not oily feeling, and good protection.
It dry a bit too fast and it a bit hard to spread but it good moisturizer.
It does protect from the sun
Im asian and with fair skin, and this sunscreen has a strong white cast. NOT for regular use you all! not unless you wear makeup.
I love CeraVe products but this one is very thick and hard to rub in. It leaves your face really white.
I don’t know what kind of sunscreen is this. Even with small amount, your face gets all white. May be a quality or something wrong with both pack. I feel like I am getting more darker after using this sunscreen.
This is a great sunscreen but it is not a daily, under make-up moisturizer w spf.
The white cast is WHITEEEEEEEEE ALSO REALLY HARD TO BLEND IN. But it does what it says protects you from the son
This product was so hard to spread and left a horrible white cast
I'm just here to back up the other women complaining about ghost face. This picture is after not using that much product and letting it soak in for 25 minutes! I've tried a lot of different mineral sunblocks, and this is one of the worst.
Not too oily. Feels great on. BUT leaves a serious white cast on skin. No matter what truck I tried. I now use this to cover some sensitive areas (like where I used exfoliating or retinol) and the rest of my skin I use a tinted spf. Not sure I’ll buy again..
To be clear, I did not get the one that says "Sheer Tint" on the bottle.  I should have.  I didn't know any better and I happily bought this one.  It's terrible.  It's unspreadable.  I used little dots on my face and tried to do small areas and it pilled and balled up so badly that out of the three times I used it, I had to wash it off (along with my skincare...ugh!) twice!  The only time it somewhat worked was when I mixed it with my beloved Australian Gold tinted botanical face sunscreen.  It still pilled around the perimeter of my face even then!  This will be tossed in the garbage.  Dr. Dray recommends the one that mentions sheer tint so I might try that but I'm very hesitant to try another CeraVe face SPF.
The product is great but I am very fair skinned and whenever I used this product it’s consistency is so thick that I look like a ghost. The sunscreen makes me look like I either have makeup or I was scared so I unfortunately stopped using it due to its consistency.
If you have a darker or fair skin tone, i do NOT recommend this. The white cast is ridiculously strong. When I first tried this, I expected application to be very simple and moisturizing, because it’s Crave, but it wasn’t. I couldn’t run it in, it got very dry very quickly. On top of that, I looked deathly sick for about 2 days because I had this terrible white hue all over my face. I was literally purple because of the white cast and it wouldn’t come off!!! I don’t recommend for my fellow black ladies or anyone with darker skin. Stay away
I’m sure that the UV protection is great, but the white cast on this is terrible. Even my bf who is pale as a vampire gets horrible white cast. It’s very thick so it’s difficult to spread, and feels like the sunscreen I used as a kid. It’s really not that great and there are better CeraVe sun protection products out there
Cerave made me breakout horrible
I have the most sensitive skin in the world, and this does not break me out or cause irritation. It goes on so smooth and silky and literally disappears after a few seconds. Love it so much!
I'm fair and this left a white cast to my face that unfortunately showed through my make up and never absorbed so this was a disappointment.
I made the mistake of buying it just because "well... it's Cerave, what can go wrong?". Wish I had read the reviews before buying it. Highly disappointed.
Takes literal ages to soak in and even if you’re fair skinned like me you’ll look like a ghost for 30 minutes.
I purchased this because I have herd good things about the brand. While they have other good products, I would skip this one. It's hard to spread and you have to use a lot of it. It leaves your face feeling dry and looks chalky. It works great for swimming but don't think you can use it for everyday use.
The product leaves an unbearable white cast, it is just impossible for me to wear it outside. Besides it is hard to spread, you need to act fast or it will get dryer and you end up tugging on your skin to further spread it. It does feel moisturizing on the skin nevertheless.
I'm not going to buy it again. It leaves me looking way too pale . I have a olive skin tone so I can't even imagine for a darker skin tone
If you do not have acne prone skin and are very pale, then this will be a great product for you! Unfortunately I do not have those qualities so it was an awful product for me. It protected me well from the sun but it caused a lot of breakouts and the difficulty in making it blend into my skin made me look like a pale halloween vampire.
Still burnt, reapplied multiple times while in the sun. Does not spread easy, leaves a white coating on your skin and everything it touches.
I am very fair skinned. I did not expect a white cast to be much of an issue but this stuff was ridiculous. It worked fine but we all looked like ghostly idiots for the day.
I wanted to love this because I like CeraVe products and it's not supposed to have the harsh chemicals like other sunscreens, but it just does not work for me.
Tried this product for a week in hopes that it would work out, but unfortunately it did not. It left a white cast on my skin & when I tried to further rub it in it started to crumble
I love Cerave and was hurt when I applied the product and it had me looking like Casper the Ghost. It was AWFUL. I am African American and I am considered brown skin; in the middle of dark and light skin. The application was difficult. It took me so long to rub it in and it barely helped. Even my parents were laughing at me. Some sunscreens will eventually blend into the skin, but nope not this one. This product is not for PEOPLE OF COLOR! Save ur coin and go on YouTube and look up sunscreen for your complexion.
It leaves a bad white cast that does not go away with anything. I bet the protection is great but does not work for dark skin
Awful allergic reaction after one use. Don’t have sensitive skin and have never had this before. Do not recommend.
Have been using cerave cream on my face and extremely happy so decided to try sunscreen.  Like that it is mineral sunscreen, but after applied it left a slight white and dry coating on my face. Disappointed!!
Was excited about using this product due to all the recommendations online but sadly disappointed. This product leaves a white cast and does not absorbs well into your hair line. Feels too thick and greasy.
If you are African American just know it does make your face ashy looking. I would recommend putting the sunscreen on before you put your daily  moisturizer on. It makes it easier to spread.
This sunscreen has a very bad white cast :(
Better than most others
I am super bummed with this product. I was expecting good things, but it was the complete opposite of good. It's SO hard to rub into your skin, almost impossible. I have to let it sit on my face for an hour before it soaks in. The white cast on it also is sooo bad. I look like a ghost and like I said, it's SO hard to rub in. I don't want to waste it so I'm saving it for when I'm outside and not in public, but there's no way I would use this as an everyday product.
I am a brown person and it left a significant white cast when I applied a tiny amount. It doesn’t blend into my skin and makes my skin look patchy.
Hmmm I look pale as a ghost and I’m pretty pale as it is! Definitely wouldn’t recommend using this one for my tan or darker people! But if your Snow White I imagine it works perfectly!
Bought as an everyday sunscreen. Difficult to spread, pilled on my skin, irritated my face, left significant white cast, a little got on my hair and won’t come off so now I have white spots on my hair. Had to completely restart my skin care routine after trying this. Love Cerave but was totally let down by this product.
There is nothing I dislike about the product
Great sun protection for my face and neck out on my bike.
Excellent
this sunscreen felt heavy and left an obvious white mask.
Very creamy and Smothe fantastic coverage would bye again
leaves a prominent white film on brown skin. I look like a ghost when I apply it. I'm sure it is very effective but I cant pretend it's Halloween everyday.
This sunscreen isn’t necessarily bad, but definitely not one that I’ll ever buy again. It didn’t break me out which is very nice since I have quite sensitive skin, but the white cast is horrible. It’s soooo hard to rub in and often pills up when mixed with the other products on my skin. My only tip to get it to blend in and show less of a white cast is to mix it with the cerave moisturizing lotion. I mix a pea sized amount of the sunscreen with a dime size amount of sunscreen and it helps a bit.
I thought I'd love this since I regularly use Cerave face wash. Nope. I found it pretty time consuming to blend and help minimize the awful white cast it would leave on my face. With medium brown skin, this was highly noticeable so I had to return.
the formula is thick and very pasty/chalky, the white cast is horrible!! i wouldn’t recommend for darker skin-even medium.
like everything about it except it leaves a little whitish tinge which disappears but I am very fair skinned so really not a big deal. I like its moisturizing  effect.
Can’t wear everyday. I’m super pale but this makes me look like a ghost. Not easy to cover with makeup
Leaves a terrible white cast. Literally could not rub in, does not dissolve, I put it on at 9a and 12 hours later I still look like Casper. Unnecessary, the 30 is just fine.
Great sun protection product but goes on very white. Hard to blend in.
This leaves a white cast. I have to cover it with powder foundation. 😩
Great sun protection without all the chemicals, unlike many face sunscreens it does not cause my face to break out and is easy to remove. Highly recommend!
I actually hated it. Leaves a stickiness in my face on top of the fact that I look like Casper and it’s just not a nice finish
It's leave your skin looking white even if you just put alittle bit
Makes you look like a clown. I put this sunblock on and rubbed it on until it was dry. I waited 15 minutes to see if the white all over my face would go away. It did not, and I had to wash it off. I looked like a clown with white face paint
It’s thick as hell, but works great. I was afraid I would break out, but I’ve been using for over a month and I haven’t. Will definitely purchase again.
Kind of thick and doesn’t rub in well. Leaves white residue.
I use this stuff every morning. Leaves a little bit of a white caste, but that goes away in minutes. I put my foundation over it. It’s not greasy at all. Literally my favorite sun screen for my face.
Is hard to rub on and leaves a horrible white cast
I have melanoma and it has taken me 20 years to find a sun screen that actually blocks the sun.
this product was super hyped up and i bought it for the sunscreen and it’s moisturizing potential... i made my skin super dry for weeks and turned my combination skin to super dry.
Too greasy and thick hard to spread!
My face was white for all day. Great for Halloween but not for daily use. However sun protection is very good
I disliked this product. It leaves my fave literaly WHITE. I don't want to look like a clown
You look like a clown.
Leaves an awful white cast. I'm already pale, so it makes me even more pale. Sure it does its job by keeping the UV rays away but it's just not worth the money. Very disappointed.
This product is SO thick and doesn’t spread at all. It makes it look like you smeared glue all over your face and feels sticky.
Leaves a super heavy white cast. Not for me. Love the higher SPF but not great on my skin. Will not purchase again.
We've been using Cerave sunscreen/lotion for years, but it seems the old bottle was discontinued and this is the new product. Somehow we accidentally ordered two but I had no regrets as we go through it pretty quickly.This is not the same product.It does not rub into your skin at all. It leaves a white, cakey mask over your entire face. Both my wife and I tried it to the same result. I don't know what they did, but this is not a functional product unless you want a white mask.
Too thick and heavy and leaves a sticky, white residue. May be ok for the beach but not as a daily moisturizer.
This leaves such a bad white cast AND it literally "shreds" off my skin. It gets crumbly and impossible to spread and I just can't use it.
Too white. Yuck!
It’s so thick your face is so white even when you spread it it cakes under makeup too
Super good for sensitive skin
I was looking for a more affordable bottle to purchase and chose this one. I am pregnant so I was looking for an option for mineral sunscreen. After rubbing in as much as I could it still left a white cast. I wanted a sunscreen for the afternoon walks, but it did not work well with my skin tone. I ordered another bottle of Cerave, the tinted 30 SPF, and that one proved to be a much better alternative.
Turns skin really white. Doesn't really absorb easily.
Light weight and sheer coverage. Love it
This is a nice product, but it leaves the absolute worst white cast I’ve ever seen. If you’re looking for something to go under your makeup this is not it.
When I applied this sunscreen, my face was white! I thought maybe with time it would turn clear. It did NOT. It stayed pale white and I looked like a vampire all day. I returned this product.
Love this !!! I Pleasantly surprised when three came in the mail. I must’ve not read the product all the way. Great value for the price
PRO: The ingredients don't irritate my skin and the formula, after drying down, it feels non-greasy and moisturizing on my face. NOTE: Please expect white-cast as this product doesn't contain nano-particles of sunscreen ingredients. (fyi, I have fair skin)CON: The formula is very difficult to spread . I would recommend patiently applying a little amount at a time. Otherwise, uneven application would leave obvious white marks on your face and you'd have to tug your skin a lot (which caused my skin to get pretty red). This product is not water resident but because of the thick formula, reapplying the sunscreen is hell.All in all, the application makes using the product impractical and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
works good
I don’t like the smell
Got this in hopes of it not having a bad white cast. White cast is horrible. I can’t even wear it under my makeup.
This works well but it makes your face very white and will not rub in.
Does not obsorb into skin.  I love other CERA PRODUCTS N O T THIS ONE.  i Want to return it.
Was not easy to spread. Very thick, smelled awful. Couldn’t apply make up over because of how thick and cakey the lotion was. Not moisturizing at all.
Super white cast. Waste of money
I disliked the thick white residueMy color turned greyDifficult to spread
If you like the pasty white look, then you found it here. My family was embarrassed to be seen with me when wearing this. I've tried other zinc oxide based products that weren't as noticeable, so it is possible.
I purchased this sunscreen last December 6, 2020 and received it on the 8th of December 2020. I did not open the product immediately as I was still finishing a bottle of sunscreen. When I was about to use the item, I noticed the product has reached its expiration date which is January 2021. I've never encountered this before wherein I was given a product that would expire immediately within the month, especially since items like this usually have a long shelf life. Hope someone from the customer service team can reach out.
I have to give low star the reason behind :Never opened to use !! Since expiry date was 1/2021. Asked for replacement they sent me again same expiry? It’s because not the quality of product it’s because their expired items delivered. Original one is received by them, I missed to returned replacement which still I have but looks the returned date was 2/1/21, I amNot sure how genuinely they will refund my money ?? Will returned that replacement too but not sure if the barcode still valid 👎🏽👎🏽😇😇👎🏽👎🏽The overall experience is bad
Would buy again
I did not like that the sunscreen did not blend into my skin well. I thought putting my makeup on top would remedy the problem but it didn’t. I looked like a clown. I have a light complexion with olive tones, but I think that even the fairest complexion man or woman would look ridiculous in public wearing this sunscreen!  Buyer beware, unless you want to scare small children.
Product is extremely thick. Very hard to spread when applying. Was looking for something that felt light when applying but protected. Product is too dense and hard to apply.
Great protection and moisture.  But it is hard to spread gently over delicate skin. Also leaves my medium tone skin looking absurdly chalky white.
I'm pretty white and this made it look like I put on white paint on my face. It was so hard to spread and it was so drying on my already dry skin. I tried it at night to see if in time the white cast would diminish and it still was pretty white. I even tried applying foundation after and you could still see the suncreen. Definitely do not recommend at all. And before anyone asks, yes I did try rubbing it in but it still left me looking dead.
Leave a horrible white cast I wanted to like this product but it left a bad white cast and got greasy
Leaves white shadow on your skin
I have never been more disappointed in a product. I guess it's my fault for not reading the review first but I just trusted the Cerave brand since I love all their other products I have tried. Although I am sure this product gives great sun protection, there was absolutely no way I could leave the house with the sun screen on my face. My face turned ghostly white and the the product dried up immediately which made it nearly impossible to rub in. This is not a cheap product either. Such a waste of money.
Maybe I got a bad batch (expiration date is in 2024), but this sunscreen started caking and flaking during the first application. This made it nearly impossible to apply. I have used a tinted Cerave sunscreen in the past and did not have this problem. This tube, however, is going in the trash.
This sunscreen does technically work but it leaves a big whitecast everywhere. My skin goes about 5 shades lighter, even when I tried to apply this sunscreen with moisturizer to even it out. I’d recommend getting a different sunscreen if you care about using it around people.
And it was hard to wash off later.It might have great protection, but it's unusable.
Way too much of a white cast
This brand is a great brand I was very excited to try this bug I put it on and realized the white cast on my face. I was very displeased, turns out it’s because of all the oxide in this product( the white stuff) so I went and bought the sheer tent  30 and it works so wellll I stil don’t like this product and wish to return it not only does it leave a white cast the package was damaged as well!!!
I will not being using this product ever again. It's very thick. I applied it on my face and my face was sticky for the entire day. AND it turned my skin color almost ghost white. I'm not a tan person by any means, but it took my face color about 3 shades lighter than normal, and it stayed that way for hours. Even with my makeup on I looked pale. Too heavy, too tinted, too sticky for my preference. The only time I might use this is if I was stranded in a desert. Highly disappointed because I typically like their products.
I found the product to be super thick. When put on my face, it left a white film, that no matter who much I rubbed it into my face, after 30 minutes, I still looked like a ghost.I put my makeup on overtop and even towards the end of the day, my face tail had a tacky feel.
When I opened my Amazon wrapper, the sunscreen was loose outside of the box it came in. The box was dented and opened. The sunscreen had no seal on the lid, or when you opened it on the squeeze spout part; this seemed sketchy to me. It also felt like about 1/4 of it was missing. I'm guessing I was sent someone else's used return, GROSS! Buyer beware! Lesson learned, I will by things like this at my drug store.
It was really hard to spead. The product was very white and was very visible on my brown skin. Too thick as well.
This Sun screen is not easy to spread, and it instantly clumps up on the face. It also has a really bad white cast. I usually love CerVe products and I have no issue with their tinted sunscreen spf 30. However this one needs to go back to the test kitchen.
This product mentions easy to rub in but after 30 minutes of trying, my face was still coated white. I'm sure it protects well, but having it not rub is not preferred.
I use a lot of Cerave products and have loved all of them so far, but I was highly dissatisfied with this product. This product does not rub in at all. No matter how much I try to rub it in my face is just white. It's also very thick and doesn't spread easy. I would recommend looking elsewhere for a face sunscreen.
The quality of the product was not as I expected. It makes your face white! and when you after a time try to spread it! it stays in your face and makes it full of spots! Also, it smells bad at the first but after a time it will disappear.
Extremely white 🙆‍♀️
Maybe the Zinc Oxide should have been the giveaway.  I was excited to use this but when I did---I kept trying to rub it in but couldn't make the white go away.  I work outside and don't wear makeup over my sunscreen but I'll have to add this extra step now so I don't scare the people I work with.  Love Cera Ve products, but will be removing this one from the subscribe and save.  :(
This sunscreen leaves a horrible white cast that not even my makeup will cover up. They must have tested this sunscreen on people with extremely white skin. Not for brown, black, or even slightly tan people. It feels smooth at first but very quickly becomes chalky and difficult to spread. I can’t even rub the white cast away or rub it into my skin after hours of wear.
This product is not good for POC. There is no way around the white cast. If you have any color whatsoever, this is not for you.  Unless, you’re a clown or doing a daytime Halloween parade in Southern California and you’re going as a ghost or vampire.
It protects your skin, does not get affected by water, and does not cause any skin issues from using.
Beyond sunscreen
This sunblock leaves a white film on your skin. I really wanted to like it. I use so many CeraVe products. It goes on nice, but it pills after drying and leaves your skin looking ghost-like with the white hue left behind. I will not purchase this again.
Great protection and non irritating but extremely thick and a little hard to spread. It’s a good product though.
Awesome product. Great coverage.
I would definitely recommend this product it has high amount of protection and stays in your skin.  You will definitely will not get sun on your face.  Great product.  Great vendor, product came on time and as posted on site.
This sunscreen is not black girl friendly. I had to wash my face just to get rid of the white cast
I do love this brand's other products, I purchased the sunscreen for added protection, it is thick like toothpaste, it does not rub in, I am a white individual and it makes me look like I rubbed chalk all over my face, I have to wipe it over and over to reduce it (thus removing the sunscreen). If left on it dries up and will flake and peel. Not the product if you are looking to wear it every day and not just to the beach.
not easy to spread.  and leaves the face white.  very annoying.  you look like a mummy.  I thought it was a better product for being cerave.
I love CeraVe products, but this is a big no for me.** Leaves a white cast on my face** Super hard to apply*** I tried different ways to spread it** I though I was applying too much so I started to apply a super small amount, but nope didn’t work👎🏼. Zinc It Over worked soo much better especially since it’s spray on, but it’s also super expensive so I gave this a try. I wish it would work since it’s cheaper, but sadly it didn’t.
What a ghostly experience.  I love the regular Cerve moisturizers this was ghastly. Will looked for something else.
Just like the other comments, this spf gave me extreme white cast, it was not hydrating at all (it was very drying) and it was rough and hard to apply on. Thank god I tested it on my arm before my face. I recommend to everyone who’s reading this, test a new spf that you newly bought on your arm instead of the face. I recommend buying the Supergoop everyday Lotion for $22 on Sephora.
Sorry but this sunblock was terrible.  It leaves the face totally white for the whole day.
Not for people of color. There is a severe white cast. However, great formulation and felt great on combo/oily skin.
Great product
I assume this product has great sun protection because it is THICK THICK THICK. I was looking for a good daily sun protection for face with a higher spf, but this is not it. I can't even see wearing this for a day at the beach! My skin felt like it was covered in thick paste, it never rubbed in well, I'm very fair but this was ghostly on me (definitely not for wearing under makeup or for darker skin). Overall this was a bad product for me.
Leaves very obvious white caste, has a greasy texture and pills when spreading and clogs pores. The smell is also unpleasant, it’s not a normal sunscreen beach smell, it smells like melting plastic or rubber.
Leaves my face really white even when I dab it on gently. Does feel light though.
I bought this for the CeraVie reputation and for my sensitive and fair/olive skin. Big mistake. Don't ignore the reviews that mention the white cast! It never completely goes away, and my skin felt dry rather than moisturized. Very disappointing product from a good company. The only thing I suspect is that it is a good sunscreen,  but not if I can't use it.  Total waste of money.
If you like to look like Casper the Friendly Ghost then this is your product. It’s super thick, hard to spread, and it leaves my skin feeling super dry! Did I mention it doesn’t photograph well? Leaves white residue everywhere.
to pasty and to white on skin
This is the most awful sunscreen I’ve ever used. It created a terrible white cast on my face, and I’m someone who uses the palest shade of foundation. It’s also extremely drying, there’s nothing hydrating about it. Not only that, but it almost had this sticky and hard consistency that made it difficult to fully remove. Avoid this product at all costs, I don’t know if it’s just expired or counterfeit but it’s terrible.
It’s like rubbing paint on your face. No wonder why it works.
I wanted to like it because I love Cerave cream, but this didn’t blend like I thought it would. I only use zinc/titanium dioxide sunscreens so i am used to a little white, BUT this was an auditioning for Casper the Ghost white. Plus, my skin felt dry while using it. Back to Banana Boat Baby sunscreen for me! Zinc that blends!
I ordered this sunscreen because I absolutely love ceraves other products like the moisturizing cream and hydrating cleanser (I have dry to normal skin). I took a little bit of the sunscreen and attempted to spread it all over my face but it was very difficult. I am olive skinned and this left a purplish white cast on my face. And it since I have dry skin it picked up all my dry skin. I would not recommend this at all. I usually use the Neutrogena dry touch 100+ sunscreen and that’s worked amazing for me.
Best sunscreen
I didn’t like the texture. You get white every time you use the product
Gohst city! If you are anything darker than light medium stay clear from this! Waaay to much of a white cast and on top of that it's thick. I have yet to find a better one so I'm sorry I can't help with that. Also would like to say that I have no tried it for underneath make-up. Under make-up should be fine as long as you don't use flash photography in the day or night.
Really hard to spread, turned me into a ghost. I looked like I put chalk all over my face and there was extreme pilling.
I put this on after my skin care routine (vitamin c serum and light moisturizer) and could not get it to blend in. It reacted with the other products I had put on, and not only started to pill but also felt like it was burning my skin. I had to wash it off right away. Maybe I'll try using it on my hands? Or save it for Halloween when I dress up as a clown.
This unfortunately is one of the worst sunscreens I've ever tried. Leaves a white cast and a horrible layer over the skin which is hard to scrub off. I could see it for days. Other create products are good but not this one.
Awful
So disappointed. This is really hard to spread. It feels very drying going on and leaves a white cast. And when I do get it all rubbed in, my makeup pills on top of it. I'll use it on my shoulders and neck to use up the bottle, but I'll never buy another. I usually love CeraVe, but I'm not a fan of any of their products with sunscreen in it.
Leaves a white film and is extremely thick! It is way to difficult to apply to face. I literally looked like a clown and had to wash it off! This is not an item for people of color. I am super disappointe!
No matter how much I rub, the white cast does not budge
This product did not have a safety seal and came already opened. Disappointed!
Very moisturizing and goes right in, not tacky!
Awful. I should have listened to other reviews how it leaves a very noticeable white mask even on my arms. Its dry feeling also when trying to spread it in more. Makeup balled up with this under. Just for reference I am a Caucasian over 40yr old  female. I like this brand for other products such as face wash & Moisturizers
It’s amazing
This product leaves a terrible white cast and does not spread easily. My skin broke out really bad after a day of use and my face was still somewhat red/burnt. My skin isn’t even sensitive. Do not waste your money. I made the mistake of buying after watching an influencer recommend the product. Turns out he was sponsored so it was most likely a dishonest review.
Has white cast bad👎
I am quite fair and the white cast is so white I can’t use this on my face. I’ll use it on my arms sometimes and keep it around as a back-up sunscreen. Also smells a little like chemicals.It feels nice, but that’s about the best thing I can say about it. I like other CeraVe products.
As much as I love this brand, this sunscreen was not easy to spread on my face and it leaves the white paste just like other sunscreens.
This is the absolutely worst facial sunscreen that I have ever used. I usually use EltaMd or La Roche Posay mineral sunscreens and since I am such a big fan of their moisturizers and cleansers, I though I’d give this a go.It goes in PURPLE amd never changes. It’s so bad. Don’t waste your $$$. This can be seen under makeup and looks awful.PASS ON THIS INE.
I love this brand.  I use it on my face and you don’t need a lot.
I'm so disappointed. I was getting ready for work waiting for this to not be white on my face anymore. I ended up washing it off. Past sunscreens I have you wait a little bit once it dried not as bad...I couldn't even go out of the house with this. I look like I have white paint on my face. So sad. I'm still on the venture for mineral sunscreen.
Heads up, folks. This product has a horrible white cast. BUT...it’s easy to get over with a drop or a few drops of foundation/tinted moisturizer. Along with the white cast, this product is somewhat hard to blend into the skin. Mine has an odd smell, but it’s tolerable. Beats getting melanoma. All in all, I’d give this product a 3/5. Only people with a specialist recommendation, with light skin, or people who want a higher SPF should buy this (in my personal, non medical opinion).
Report abuse
I used to use elta sunblock, so thought I'd give this a go because many of the same marketing lines are used... but it's horrible. Like other reviewers said it doesn't spread at all. And on top of that if you have sensitive skin... which I'm guessing many of you do it might burn your skin like it did mine and cause an allergic reaction :/ . I do normally like CereVe products but did they do any product testing on this???
I was so excited to purchase this but I was extremely disappointed. The only way you can use this is if you want to go to a Halloween party and use it to paint your face white haha. Seriously! It’s so hard to spread and your face will look like you added white makeup!! No joke! Don’t waste your money.
I don't usually write reviews but I have to for this one. It's a TRASH!!! The worst thing I've ever tried I wonder if it's actually a sunscreen or a cement I'm polishing my face with. Never ever think of buying it literally it's like a cement; doesn't spread out and leave a stroooong white polish on ur face as if u are casper!
Makes my face super oily and the white film is almost impossible to rub in. I’ve even tried using a smaller amount and it still doesn’t absorb into my skin.
White caste is so annoying but it does function.
Received the product in the mail and immediately tried on a dimed sized amount. Well the dimed sized amount was enough to cover my small face and I made sure to rub it in throughly. However, it left my face completely white no matter how much I rubbed/spreaded it around. Have you, I am fair toned. I have not used again. Not happy with product.
Seriously, don’t buy it. It didn’t rub in easy whatsoever! It leaves your face white.
After reading all of the reviews and loving cerave products, I decided to try their sunscreen. HUGE MISTAKE! I’m 100% sure the one I bought was fake, it comes out like white face paint, is extremely streaking, and smells like tires. I’m not exaggerating in any way, please do not buy this! I have dry, sensitive skin and I tried the sunscreen once and it made my eczema flare up again.
This spf is terrible, don’t buy it. It’s extremely hard to spread and rub in. I tried everything. It leaves the thickest white cast to the point where it looks like I put white paint on my face. Adding moisturizer doesn’t help either. It’s very thick and it’s sticky when applied to the skin and it doesn’t feel moisturizing at all. It feels very heavy on the skin. I feel like there are other products that will provide sun protection without making you look ridiculous.
Not made for people of color
This product probably works great and won’t irritate your skin, but it does not blend into your skin. Your face will have a film of white on it. It will give you a purple/white hue. I am Polish with a slight tan. I can’t imagine this product working for someone of color. I am returning it.
I like it
This left a horrible whitecast on my face - it was like I had put toothpaste or glue on my face. I could not blend it out, and even after waiting a couple hours it was still there. My complexion is relatively fair but this sunscreen is like white paint. I will have to use it on my hands or something.
I bought this hoping to replace my current spf moisturizer. I had high hopes cause it was CeraVe. I put it on right before I had to leave the house and my sister saw and laughed at me because it was so ridiculously white. It also does not run well into the skin. Don’t get it. It’s not worth it.
It dried up my skin and left a noticeable white cast on my face.
It's a little too greasy it doesn't blend in well
if necessary, excellent product
So if your into skincare, this thing will pill up onto your face immediately while spreading it. Worse sunscreen I’ve ever used.
Left a white cast. Hard to absorb. Not enough sun protection.
Product is good but when applied leaving a thick residue. I prefer spray than cream
Please dont buy this if you have a dark skin tone. It makes you look like a ghost. I've tired spreading and using very little and it still leaves white residue on my skin.
The best!
Greasy and thick, doesn’t spread evenly!
The sunscreen spreads fine..however it leaves such a white cast you look like you played in clown makeup.
not the worst white cast, but pretty noticeable​, hard to blend
This leaves a white cast behind. It doesn’t rub in easily. It’s just not a good product overall.
It doesn’t rub in. Leaves your face very white. Thick and heavy. Not my favorite product of Cerave. Does work as far as protecting from harsh UV rays tho.
I rely on Amazon to screen products for false. Clearly, this product is not what it claims to be. I am afraid to use a product whose second largest ingredient is glycerin on my face.I am disappointed in CeraVe but also in Amazon for allowing company to advertise false claims on Amazon site.
Sunscreen . Does not blend in the skin.
Leaves a white cast and is impossible to blend in.
Leaves your face very whites
"The formula should spread easily leaving a lightweight, non-greasy feel"...Feels tacky, like glue. Not greasy, sure, but not lightweight. Not one to skip the instructions, I spread it thin, rubbed it in thoroughly-- enough to irritate my skin-- but it stayed very visible. After eight hours, still visible and still felt tacky on my skin. Returning.
I love to protect my skin and this really does its job
I have been buying this product for a long time and what I received today was absolutely terrible. First of all it smelled like tar, it instantly hurt my skin, it was not spreadable and left a terrible white cast. I’ve had it on my face for less than an hour and it’s pilling. So so so disappointing
Like many people wrote - it’s like trying to rub white paint on your face. Hard to spread, doesn’t actually rub in and you’re left looking like a vampire in a cheap 90s off broadway show.  Either there is a batch of ‘fake’ ones going around or someone at CeraVe has a sick sense of humor to let this be sold.
The sunscreen leaves a white cast. Does not get absorbed into the skin.
n/a
I don’t like the idea of turning my skin gray. It doesn’t matter how much you rub in or white it just stay gray. I need this type of product due to my skin cancer. I wish I could find something else that works better. Not happy at all.
Leaves a white film
Leaves a white cast and is very difficult to rub into skin. Does not absorb well at all. Otis very effective, but difficult to use the amount required for your face because it is heavy on the skin and leaves the white film. Would not recommend for under makeup. It is not moisturizing.
Leaves a very obvious white cast :/
Terrible white cast<—and that’s an understatement. It’s an incredibly thick and white sunscreen. It feels good on the skin, but you’ll look terrible. You have to wear skin tone makeup to cover the white.
It leaves your skin looking white as a ghost
It's got the right ingredients to do the job. Not fancy, but also not pricey.  Needs very little and needs to be blended in, but it is good for my skin.
I was quite disappointed after reading all of the 4 plus reviews about the Cerave face sunblock. I'm pretty fair and this left an obvious white mask all over my face. If I was going out kayaking in the sun for the day, sure. But for everyday wear this was a big, "NO" for me. Look elsewhere.
Very nice texture and fSt absorbant, but it makes your skin white.
Left a really absurd white cast behind, do not buy this!!
Doesn’t matter your skin tone, this will leave a visible white cast.
This was the Worst sunsreen product I have ever facial  used.  If you are into Heavy Metal Music and want the part of a Zombie or want a Halloween Disguise MAYBE it would be worth something,  Definitely Heavy,  Greasy, and leavs your face white.
White deposit
Works great ... applies easily, fights the Sun, what's not to like!
This is crap. Seriously. It is thick and hard to apply without a lot of pulling and tugging and if that wasn’t enough it leaves a white residue that is almost impossible to cover. I used it twice thinking the first time was just a fluke, it wasn’t. I threw it in the trash.
A couple of close calls on personal facial skin cancers has made me a believer in protection at all ages.  My dermatologist recommended this product for the zinc protection.
Horrible for everyday use
Doesn’t blend well. Leaves you white. Love all their other products. But this one!
Great sunscreen but makes you face etc. white
This didn’t sit over my (also CeraVe) moisturizer at all. It was too thick and hard to spread. When I tried to have it sit on top, it ended up clumping together and leaving a separated, beaded texture. I will not purchase this again and I won’t use it even if I didn’t want it sitting over moisturizer.
This sunscreen claims to be “lightweight,” but it is so heavy that it’s IMPOSSIBLE to rub in. (It will make you look like a ghost - I’m not even exaggerating). It also starts to get streaky/rub off if you try to work woth it too long which means it probably doesn’t offer very even protection. I also found that even though it’s supposed to be for dry skin, it makes my skin feel dry and it makes the dry skin on my face very visiblr and crusty looking.
This sunscreen consistency was terrible. It was impossible to blend and left a terrible white cast on the skin. When I try to blend it in, the product ends up piling up. I was excited to try another CeraVe product but this totally misses the mark. I will be returning.
Literally expires in a month. Ughhh !!! What the hellllI want my money backk
Great sunscreen for sensitive skin!
Did not rub well into the skin
This is absolutely the worst face sunscreen i have ever used. It was way too thick - not at all lightweight. It sat in my skin and provided no hydration. Also, I am very light in complexion but this made me look like Casper the ghost - literally white like paper. Not good at all. Terrible.
This is not for sensitive skin, I would suggest you look into the ingredients.
I don’t recommend this product for POC because it will leave you ashy and purple
I did not like this sunscreen as the white cast was atrocious and it was hard to blend it in. I didn't finish the bottle.
I really wanted to like this sunscreen. It does go on easily and smoothly. It doesn't have a greasy or oily feeling. I really liked that about it. The only issue is that it leaves a very very very white residue on your face. I am very fair, and this made me look like I washed my face with powdered sugar. If you plan to wear makeup over it, I think it would work really well. I'm just not someone who wears makeup.
This didn’t feel very moisturizing. It took a lot of effort to rub into my skin and left my face feeling dry.
Great Protection if you don’t mind looking slightly white
Do not buy this! My face is now a zombie blueish-white. The product is not necessarily “greasy” but it’s hella sticky/tacky feeling. After my workday my face was shiny and white collections of this stuff blotched my face.I had intended to order the clear version that goes on invisibly. Hoping that one or another brand will be better
Wow I don’t know what happened with this product but it’s not good. Everything else I have tried from them has been amazing but this just is too thick and cakes up no matter what you do and you look like a plaster ghost walking around. I have tried mixing with other products to help and it is pointless just throw it away.
I ordered this product thinking it was safe. I have read a few articles about ingredients in sunscreen and Titanium Dixoide is always at the top of the list for unsafe. This product has 9 percent of it as active ingredients and they don’t list all the other ingredients.
It’s ok, BUT I applied and looked like a GHOST. Gonna try to mix with some bronzer or something because this doesn’t look good just by itself.
Leaves a white cast on face. Makes me Looks pale. Not the best formula.
I purchased this in hopes of a good spf and moisturizer. This was not even near the best. This spf leaves a white cast. It was very hard to apply fast enough before it dried out. It was very drying and just didn't look good. I tried mixing it with a moisturizer but it didn't help with any of my issues. I wouldn't reccomend this product.
Don’t use too much. I literally turned purple 😂
leaves a horrible white cast and difficult to spread around the face. however, i do feel very protected from the sun when wearing this sunscreen.
Horrible. So thick I felt like I was putting patste on my face. Would not rub in. Ended up having to wash my face so I didnt look like a ghost with peeling skin because of the horrid pilling. I use cerave tinted sunscreen 30 and it's great. Surprised this is even being sold.
I was so excited to finally try this, but the whitecast is way worse than expected....
I look absolutely ridiculous all day if I use this. It was pretty cheap as far as mineral sunscreens go, and I was hoping to reduce the moisturize / sunscreen steps of my regimen into a single step. I had to triple check to make sure I was actually using a product intended for faces.I don't use makeup, so perhaps there is a way to cover this up for those who do. For those planning on using only this, I'd only recommend if you're going for a serious goth vibe.
To white on the skin.
Just like others say, this product is really dry, applies poorly and leaves a white film on you. I also tried mixing it with an oil and a moisturizer, but the white residue remains on your face, as if you over-powdered it.How does this have 4 stars???
Makes my skin very dry and white. I will use it for only body and neck...
I love cerave but this sunscreen SUCKS. I knew from other reviews there would be a white cast but read it would go away within a few minutes. WRONG. chalky and horrible to spread too. I'm white and pale and even for me it's way too much.
it's a gift for my friend.  she likes it
Product is defective, the expiration date on the product may have a couple of years on it but I wouldn’t trust it at all. The sunscreen is crumbly with weird consistency. Upon applying a small amount to my hand I noticed that it didn’t blend in to my skin no matter how much I tried to rub it in. It leaves a white residue with crumbles on your skin. Gross! Very disappointed with the product and even more disappointed with amazon’s customer care when I tried reporting this to them.
Makes your face super white.
I love cerave’s main moisturizer product (blue and white tub), but this product does not blend. It leaves your skin chalk-white. I’m sure it is an effective SPF, but I will just stick to the more expensive LaRoche-Posay facial SPF 60. That one melts into your skin.
SPF 50 but not easily applied.
I regretted to buy this, The box came open, And the cream can’t be use, when you put it on, it look like a muddy white mask. I wish I could remember to return it.
It does not blend with skin. Leaves behind white patches even after applying it evenly. Very much unsatisfied.
Can I give zero stars? I did not believe in others' comments about using this sunscreen which makes your face white so I used it myself and did not like it at all. It does not spread easily and god knows why it makes my skin look so bad.
Comes out too thick to spread, looks like I have white out on my face (And I'm pretty pale) if you try to spread it, it just turns into thick white balls. My skin feels dryer after use. Honestly both the worst sunscreen and lotion I have ever used.
I’m a retired professional clown with extremely pale skin. This sunscreen is like spreading toothpaste all over your face- both in color and consistency . You will look like a freak caught under a flock of birds with colitis. I normally love this brand and I rarely write reviews.
I do not plan to continue using this sunscreen because it it so thick it’s impossible to run in. It leaves my face extremely white.
Was easy to apply and moisturizing but left a huge white cast. Don’t recommend for darker skin
it left my face white like white face paint, difficult to spread, dried it out after one use and when i tried to wash it off it left my washcloth white. it took several attempts to get it all off. it's like using white paint on your face.
The white cast was so bad. I tried to blend it in as much as I could but it didn’t want to blend. Wouldn’t recommend if you are a POC.
My dermatologist recommended this product. I could not find it locally. Thank you for providing it. I am very pleased with this product.
Very thick, leaves a white pasty look on your face no matter now little you use. Very hard to rub in and it sticks to your eyebrows and leaves little balls of white stuff all over your face!!  Horrible!!!  I sent it back!!!!
I am not here to trash the product, because it probably does serve its purpose of protecting your skin from UV Rays.BUT as an Indian brown skin girl, this will leave an ashy white cast on your skin. I do not recommend buying this product. I ended up returning the product 👍🏽
This literally leaves a white film on your face. Worst sunscreen ever. Even if you apply a little bit it still makes your face chalky, after trying to rubbing it for minutes. DO NOT BUY
I was so surprised how hard ro apply it, it doesn't soak into skin and leave white spots on the face. After I tried to apply sunscreen, it was not possible to apply make up after that. I had to return this and would not recommend this suncreen.
It is so thick, I am as pale as you can get but the white of the sunscreen is still extremely visible. Weird gritty oily rub in texture. Not for under makeup or like in public everyday unless you want to look like you have a white paint on or really sit there and rub it in I dilute it with other lotion if I even ever use it
Unable to rub it in. It clumps almost immediately.
Sun protection and moisterizing
The texture is white and my skin didnt obsorbe it. No matter the ingredients as long as I am shy to meet anybody while it is on my face.I doubt that this product passed by testing and evaluation before launching. However, i used other products from same brand and they were good.
Leave a pearl look on face😍So silky!
The product is very pasty and very difficult to spread, the face is left with a white coating, it is definitely not for daily iso, hopefully this comment will help someone so that they do not waste their money, I will have to buy another.
I bought this product because of all of the positive reviews but when I put it on my face it was sticky and hard to spread. It left my face looking blotchy with white residue all day. It never absorbed in to my skin. I couldn't wait to get home and wash it off. I also purchased the Neutrogena Sensitive Skin SPF 60+ it was a million times better than this one.
I like CeraVe products in general and this sunscreen is great! Doesn't leave a white film and leaves my face feeling smooth and hydrated.
good lord. this makes my face WHITE. anyone with melanin do NOTTTTT buy this. i have tanish skin and this makes my face whiteeeeee. i’ve been mixing it with my regular moisturizer but only use a little bit because that’s how strong it is. won’t be buying again
What the fawk is this... this cream turned me into Michael Jackson.. heehee
You can definitely tell the sunblock is on bc it is tough to mix into the skin, but you know it is working.
Not at all what was described. It is sticky and very difficult to apply. Will not work under make up because it leaves your face very, very white. I guess if you are going to the beach, it would protect you well, because your face is basically a white mask. The sun's rays will definitely not get through (just don't let any kids see you cause they will get scared). Too bad.
If I could give this a zero I would. It is so thick and heavy and it leaves a white thick film on your skin, will not rub in. I would never recommend this to anyone. A waste of money.
Not lightweight. Super greasy. It leaves a thick white layer.
Very hard to spread and makes skin very white.
This is supposed to be moisturizing! It was so dry and very difficult to spread, not to mention the white, but that comes with the territory of zinc.
Moisturizing
Believe all the reviewed. For once I did not see the reviews because I live all products by CeraVe. Unfortunately this makes my tan skin look like a clown. Don’t buy it! I had to return it immediately!
I’m extremely pale and this even left a horrible white cast on me. I applied it after my moisturizer and it still made my skin incredibly dry and it seemed like I had to put on 10lbs of moisturizer on to try and fix it. I love CeraVe but this is awful
Have used Cerave moisturizers for years.  Thought I would try this new mineral sunscreen.  Sadly, i wasted my money on this product as the white cast does not fade after drying.
Hard to apply. Feels dry and leaves too much of a white cast on your face. I like Cerave but disappointed with this one.
I bought this after reading reviews and was totally let down. Even a pea size amount will leave you WHITE. Its a terrible thick heavy formula, very hard to spread and even harder to blend out- definitely NOT going to buy again. Wasted my money.
THIS IS TRASH !!!!!
If you have brown skin or any skin tone that isn’t pale...this will turn your skin white or an odd grey color.
I heard great things about this but when I went to put it on no matter how much I rubbed my face was ghostly WHITE, and felt super greasy. I had to wash it off with face wash and use my old product... I get zinc can be hard to rub in but I've never had sunscreen so that to my face.
If I had option to give negative rating. This product is surely not for brown/dark skin. It leaves white cast and when you rub it off feels like one has left soaked tissue particles. In addition you get irritation, skin breakout. Pls don’t buy this product just coz it’s cerave. This particular product is utter waste.
As a person of color, this sunscreen is a 0/10 as it leaves a blue cast wherever you apply it.
Cerave makes wonderful products and has been highly rated by many dermatologists and beauty gurus. However, this sunscreen was not it. This product leaves a horrible white cast! Even for my fair light skin child it left a major white cast. Not worth the money. I have heard the Cerave 30SPF tinted sunscreen is the best so go purchase that one.
Just goes on white and stays white. For a while. Don’t know if it helps with the sun blocking but it sure good for your next performance at birthday parties!  Great for clowning! Rough and dry to smear on. Itches. But you end up happy or sad. Depending on what clown you like to be.
Hyram recommended this sunscreen, and usually he is right, but this is the worst face sunscreen I have ever had. I'm very pale so I thought maybe the white cast wouldn't be too big of a deal, but it is horrible. If you have any color in your skin this is not the sunscreen for you. I also feel like the product didn't last all day
I couldn't get past that the sun screen leaves a pasty  white look on your face and got into my hair line. I had to use a towel to wipe off.  I used extra moisturizer on top to remove the white film over my face.
Not moisturizing, hard to blend in, and leaves a TERRIBLE white cast. I have fair skin and I look like a ghost. Cerave is normally a really good brand for me, but this sunscreen sucks. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Supergoop! and this did not deliver. Very disappointed.
I wanted to really like this but was disappointed with how bad of whitecasting it left. It also doesn’t help how hard it was to spread it evenly and left a tacky feeling.
Made me look like Barney /: 1/10If you're neon white pale, it is a good sunscreen. If you have a single iota of melanin, pass.
This is super thick and tacky. It's really hard to spread over your face without tugging alot.. And that's obviously not good for your skin. I'm tan and this left a white cast over my face and it also separated my makeup. I broke out really badly the night after I started to use this soo.. I will not recommend! (I have combo/ acne prone skin)
Stay away from this product. It give you a heavy white film that is very hard to smooth out. Spreading it is very hard. It does not glide, so it feels uncomfortable when you are trying to spread it out so it’s not so concentrated in one area otherwise You will have a kabuki face. I can’t go out wearing this, I look so ridiculous.
This sunscreen is thick (I had to rub my face all over to spread it evenly 😕) and has a horrible white cast 😔 I feel it protects your face from the sun really well however, the white cast really bothers me 😬
Because this is a decent brand and the zinc oxide was 7%, I didn’t read the reviews. Every negative comment is true. If you still decide to buy this product,  expect starchy WHITE paste that does not absorb. Buyer beware.
The skin won't absorb as fast as expected and leaves a very heavy white cast. After sweating and being in the sun my skin started to itch and the sunscreen to fall off.
unless you love white cast do not buy this. thank you very much.
I did not like this product at all. Like a lot of cerave products this sunscreen casted a white shadow on my face and didn’t blend very well with skin. It made me look pasty. For an everyday sunscreen they should have different skin tone options.
Great sunscreen. I am allergic to all others.
i purchased this product because I have eczema prone skin and wanted to use a brand known for their eczema-friendly products. I LOVE CeraVe soaps and lotions, but this SPF lotion just didn't do it for me.It's sticky and really hard to spread. No amount of rubbing will remove the whitecast on my olive colored skin.I would skip this product.
This product will leave you looking like Casper. No matter how much you massage it in you can’t get rid of the white cast. I tried mixing some oil in it, some toner, moisturizer, you name it. The white cast prevailed each time. I’m the product itself is good but not worth looking like you dipper your face in flour.
This is the worst sunscreen i’ve ever used. The white cast is disgusting and it’s so hard to spread. I’ve never had a product infuriate me as much as this one has. I’ve used cerave products in the past and was happy with them so i’m really disappointed with my experience using this sunscreen.
I wanted to love this badly because Cerave is EVERYTHING to my skin! I use multiple products from this brand for my face and body and love them all.This, on the other hand -- if you have even a drop of melanin in your skin, you will get an ashen pinkish/purplish hue, almost corpse-like. This is my result, and this is RUBBED IN. Skip this product.
It made my ski. Look pale and not natural as if i were putting on a foundation to light for my skin.  Did not blend or disappear like say a lotion on to skin.
The product says lightweight and non greasy but it is actually so thick That it is hard to spread leaving the face white no matter how little you apply. I just didn’t like to be outdoors looking like a ghost lol.
This stuff is way too thick and makes you sweat. It takes forever to rub in. Sitting in my office I am sweating through this pore clogging glop. I do not recommend. It comes off all over your clothes and hands when outside, and it makes EVERYTHING chalky. Do not even think about the color black.
i bought this product because i heard it was good for oily skin. it actually does dry matte. however, it leaves a horrible white cast and i am a black woman so i cannot use this at all...had me looking like a ghost. i wouldn't recommend this product at all. this is the worst sun screen i've ever used.
I'm very fair so I didn't think the white cast would matter. It smells like burning industrial waste, doesn't sink in, leaves a white film over everything, and made my eyebrows look like they had wax on them. Wish I had listened to the reviews
For my husband, who has very light skin
good
As Expected
great sunscreen - the application is uncomfortable because it’s incredibly sticky and feels way too heavy
Goes on white and takes massaging to absorb and become transparent. Not a negative, but an fyi.
I laughed at myself when I put this on.I’m pretty sure this product will protect you from the sun but it is not dark complex friendly.Unless you are as light skinned as the color of this sunscreen, this will not work for you.
This must be a joke. Easy to spread? If anyone remembers the pure zinc oxide from the 70s(the white grease on noses) this is not far off. Could have been an extra in The Walking Dead!
Been using this for a month now. Liking the results
My daughters dermatologist recommend it for her face during the summer months
The white cast on this sunscreen is HORRRRRRIBLE!  Its as if I'm using white paint on my face. On top of that, my face feels drier than usual so its not very moisturizing? Cant really rate the sun protection because I had to wash this white mask off. I'm not even that tan, so POC stay away!
Leaves a heavy, HEAVY white cast! If you don’t mind looking like a mime, I suppose it would be OK. I love Cerave products, so I am keeping it but will be using it on other parts of my body like my arms and legs.Anywhere but my face, and I’m pretty fair, a solid Fitzpatrick’s 3.
If I could give it a 0 star review I would! This sunscreen left my skin patchy and red left me Itchy. The product came without a seal and the product box was sealed with tape...
It was too white on my face
I have dry and sensitive skin and 100% a Cerave addict. This sunscreen is horrible. I have pale skin and it gave me a white cast. In addition, It leaves my skin so dry.Stay away from this product!!
Good
I use mineral sunscreens because they are light and don't break me out (most sunscreens break me out). This one is heavy and breaks me out. Everyone I know that uses mineral sunscreen uses them for similar reasons, so I couldn't recommend this to anyone I know (or, therefor, to you, random Amazon customer).
Excellent!
This product was so pasty that is is almost impossible to rub into the skin. Even with great care, it left a white haze that is unsightly. And it is difficult to see any moisturizing when there is so little moisture in it that it can hardly be spread. Will never buy again!
Please dont buy this. Just dont.It's the worst sunscreen I've every purchased. Leaves a white cast and doesn't spread very well. I gave up on using it for my face and use it on my body instead.
Good
Made the terrible mistake of trying this out for the first time before going to work. I’m a pale person as is, so this made me look post-Mortem. I don’t own and foundation so I seriously had to wash it off, I could not leave the house looking like that. Absolutely terrible.
It leaves a thick white residue on my skin. I’m Asian and naturally tan and my husband is Caucasian.  Both of us look like we have white masks on when we apply it.
If your complexion is tanner than chalk,  beware this product! I'm sure it does its actual purpose fine,  but I can't wear this out of the house without looking like I'm cosplaying as Pennywise. The cast is very white and doesn't fade away with time or rubbing the product in.
I don’t know if I just got a bad tube or what but no matter how much the amount of product I used it left me looking like a ghost. I tried the recommended amount then I tried the littlest amount I could, it still left a white film over my face.
Used product and it burned the skin in 10 minutes.  Found out it had ingredients causing allergic reaction.  Would NOT recommend this product.
This sunscreen doesn’t blend in. It leaves a white mask and for a dry to normal skin type pregnant woman it’s hard to remove with a natural wash. Had to use pads with toner to remove the remains. Would not recommend if you are pregnant and have a dry to normal skin type.
Unpleasant texture and it never absorbed entirely into my skin. Left a significant white cast that was tacky to the touch for the whole day. I'm sure it protected me from UV damage, but I won't be using it again. Blue Lizard is preferable.
It's very thick and does not spread and soak into the skin easily.
Left my face soooo white. I spent minutes trying to smear it in and get it working. Gave up and put a dark foundation and powder on top, and it was still obvious. Tried again the second day to no avail. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS if you want to look normal. If you don't care, then go for it.
It works well, but for 10 min one will have a ghost like appearance
This is an abomination of sunscreen!!! This picture is after five minutes of trying to rub it in. It's literally like trying to put toothpaste on your face. I look like I'm about to go haunt a family who just bought a new house.
I would like a refund for this product, it’s terrible for your face, I look like a ghost, and it’s much thicker than other face sunscreens I’ve used, I would never use this product or recommend to others.
If you don't mind having a layer of white all over your face then this is probably a great product for you. I'm sure the product works well but I can't leave the house looking like this.
This is my first review on Amazon, thanks to this product I got severe breakout and worst of all in my whole life. Very disappointed. I have been using their products for quite a while and this is the very first one that cause severe breakout on me. I hope I can save my skin!
Feels very heavy on the skin, doesn’t blend at all, and leaves your face looking white and patchy. I still use it when I’m going to be outside for an extended period of time at home but would not recommend  buying/using it if you plan on going out in public.
Love it
Don’t waste your money. I’m not sure if this product just doesn’t work for Black ppl or it just doesn’t work at all. It dried up on my skin, wasn’t easy to rub in, and left an awful white caste on my skin.
I love cerave but this sunscreen was bad and left my skin looking white
Not easy to spread. It’s rough and I have to tug on my face to spread it. Leaves a white cast.
It's not a good sunscream. I look like a mimo after use it with my white face.
Translate review to English
Cera Ve always has great products.. but this one is not it. I am extremely pale and this sunscreen doesn’t blend and leaves THE BIGGEST white cast on your face. Even when it is rubbed in I still have a blueish/whiteish/purplish hue on my skin. Would not recommend at all
Horrible. Tried to run it in and it was dry and hard to run in as well as made me white. I thought I read reviews before I bought but I might got too excited that it was cerve and they are hyped up so much. Will be returning
I usually love Cerave products but this was horrible.Left a white outcast worse than any other sunscreen I’ve used. When I tried to blend it in evenly on my face it balled up and I was left with patches of white sunscreen all over. Waste of money.
As a previous fan of CeraVe, this product really disappointed me. Impossible to blend, felt like a layer of clay on my face, incredibly drying, and left the worst white cast I've ever had from sunscreen. Would never buy again.
This product didnt rub in well at all and left a complete whitecast on my skin. It dries the skin out and leaves it feeling greasy at the same time, definetly do not recommend this product
Can I get my money back? It does not blend into skin well, it leaves my skin looking pasty white, it does not moisturize what so ever. It leaves me skin feeling flaky and DRY
Leaves white cast on skin no matter how much you rub it in. Very rough feel on the face, not hydrating at all. Vichy is much better
Great product recommended by my dermatologist
Terrible. Don’t buy this unless you want a shiny blue/white cast. It was so hard to spread and once I finally thought I had gotten it I looked back into the mirror and my face looked blueish. I washed my face immediately to remove this.
I like this product because it like you don't have it on.
This product is absolutely terrible. Sure it has SPF 50, but you can barely spread it around your face. I have dry skin so I thought it would be good for me since it says hydrating, and it stuck to my face like glue. Definitely not going to be using this!
I love most CeraVe products but not this one.  I use the hydrating facial cleanser, moisturizing lotion with sunscreen, p.m. moisturizer, and they all work well for me. I wanted something with a higher SPF than the 30 in the facial a.m. moisturizer so I picked up the SPF 50 face sunscreen because I have rosacea and burn at the drop of a hat so I don’t  take any chances. It is very protective, even forgiving if I forget to reapply after swimming, and it does not irritate my skin. But I am pale and this leaves a white film on my face that is noticeable. I would not agree with the package that it is lightweight. I have to avoid rubbing it in around my eyebrows and hairline because once it gets in the hair, forget about trying to rub it in. It also soaks into every pore. It is great under my makeup with primer on top. For a day at the lake/beach, I deal with looking whiter than usual and usually use a mirror when I reapply to avoid looking like Casper the friendly ghost. I will be happy when the tube runs out. It’s protective but the formula is aesthetically awful. I will find another brand that doesn’t make me look like I’m painted.
I never usually post reviews but had to ok this product! Just be careful I honestly think these a third party fake products  or just bad quality even though I have used cerave products before.
This product left a really obvious white cast on my face. I tried blending it into my skin for about a minute and it started clumping together instead of blending into my skin. Do not recommend for anyone especially POC.
As a huge fan of Cerave I had high hopes for this, but this product is terrible. White cast, doesn’t blend into the skin at all…I probably should’ve read the reviews first.
Dislike . Leaves a white/purplish tint on faceDoesn’t dissolve well into the skin, leaves small white flakes on face
I thought I loved all Cerave products. But this sunscreen is awful!!!  Leave a white film on your face!! Looked like I had put zinc oxide on my face. I do NOT recommend it!
Absolutely horrible. Leaves a terrible white cast and when it dries it looks like powdered sugar. It's so drying. And I like it said it looks like I rubbed white paint on my face.
PERFECT
I tried this stuff on my face and literally looked like a ghost. It didn't rub in at all and stayed very white. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I was very displeased and ended up tossing the rest of the bottle in the garbage.
Great sunscreen. My Dermatologist recommendation!
Good quality mineral sunscreen, effective immediately (unlike chemical sunscreen)Also works as moisturizer
Ugh this stuff... I had such high hopes.Left a BRIGHT WHITE cast on my face ALL DAY. Even after applying makeup over top. It felt very thick and heavy on my sensitive skin and broke me out quite a bit from one use. I returned this item.
Very thick, hard to spread as well as hard to rub into the skin
We use this at the beach. My grandson still got burned. It caused puffiness around this eyes. Felt so sorry for him. It did get better. Would not recommend for young children.
Recommended by my dermatologist.  Absolutely love it!
Drys hard and white on your skin and stays on skin like a plaster, until washed off. Unattractive  look.. will toss.
I don’t have a problem with this product as I used it before. I have a problem with amazon bec in 2 MONTHS TIME the 2 bottles that I bought WILL BE EXPIRED! It’s highway robbery. Cheating your customer. You shouldn’t allow this.
I'm already very very pale and this sunscreen left a super white cast on my face looked like i put white foundation on. When i tried to rub it in it beaded up and left chunks on my face also feels very very greasy.
The white cast this sun screen gives is horrible. Even under my make up you can still see it. Currently looking for a new sunscreen. I love CeraVe but this was a total miss.
If you’re black then this isn’t for you! EXTREMELY WHITE OVERCAST 😭😭😭😭
I love the Cerave cream. What I do not love is that the expiration date is 11/20. It literally expires in less than a week. So the product has been sitting in the warehouse for a couple years. Poorly done Amazon!
Literally so bad, white cast THE worst I’ve ever experienced and doesn’t disappear no matter how much you work it into the skin, totally not a hydrating feel to it either
Leaves a thick white coating on your face. Looks ridiculous after you apply it. I don’t recommend it
It's too thick to spread evenly and it doesn't absorb into your skin,  just leaves a horrible whitecast. I tried using a moisturizer before , but it still makes my face look dry.
please do not waste your money on this product. it literally smells like gasoline, and the white cast was so bad that my FULL COVERAGE foundation couldn’t even save me. your better off with the cerave spf 30. trust me sis
I personally love cerave and have a ton of their products, but this sunscreen is not it. It has a white cast, and even if you mix it with moisturizer it still won’t go away. I would recommend a tinted sunscreen by them instead.
This sunscreen is definitely not for darker skin tones. It left me with a purple cast so I can’t use it all. I tried to rub it out and I also tried to apply a VERY small amount; the purple cast still remained.
Do not purchase unless you are as pale as paper even then it is way to difficult to blend into the skin. I’ve tried thinning it out with moisturizer and even applying less product and nothing helps to blend this thick spf into the skin.
Protective and affordable
expired 09/20
Was not a full bottle. No seal. Box was messed up. Will be returning.
Leaves a white cast and settles on any dry skin
Although I do feel like it protects me from the sun it’s not easy to spread at all. Very thick NOT moisturizing and leaves a white film all over your face.
Doesn’t rub in well
Not easy to rub my face was white horrible purchase 😒 don't buy
This is just AWEFUL. I love cerave products. But this one really is not  wearable.  I applied it once. My face was as white as a ghost. I had to immediately washed my face and throw it out. Very disappointed.
After one use, my face broke out into a rash that left red bumps on my forehead and cheeks. The sunscreen is very thick and does not feel like something that should be on your face.
Haven’t got acne for a year. Used this product. Broke me out in a day.
Cerave Tinted sunscreen does not seem to be available right now, so I ordered this. Mistake. I'm not sure whose face this would even be appropriate for...it is just horrifying. It goes on bluish white and stays that way. Pass, pass, pass.
Applied per directions. Be aware it doesn’t absorb. It left a white clown like mask on by face, with white all over neck and arms. The zinc just doesn’t absorb. Needed  to wash all off before going out in public.👎😒
This sunscreen left a terrible white cast. It left my face feeling very matt and my face had a clay feel to it with this product on.
The freaking box came open!!!!!It has no seal whatsoever!How can I know for sure this wasn't used already?
This product offered great sun protection, however, despite my regular exfoliating, this product couldn’t be blended into my skin without it creating these little peeling things, mimicking peeling skin. It made it impossible to put on and blend. Never again.
I like this brand but this sunscreen just left a very noticeable white cast on me no matter what I did to conceal it. If you’re planning to wear it for daily use don’t buy, especially if you’re of colored skin.
Excellent protection without harmful chemicals.Feels good on the skin
Don't buy this unless you want to look like a ghost. This sunscreen doesn't absorb well. It sits on the surface of your skin leaving a white cast.
Horrible white cast. White residue everywhere no matter how much you rub the product in. Do not buy if you do not have light skin. This is not a product for tan or dark skin people. Waste of money...
Absolutely horrible doesn’t spread, doesn’t moisturize, the white cast is horrendous, and if it couldn’t get any worse it just pills up on the skin and gets everywhere.
It Definitely leaves a cast. I looked like a mime lol. My face felt very dry even though I had a moisturizer under the sunscreen
It didn’t blew down in my face, it’s left me really white and have white streaks all over my face. Very hard to blend. I do have dry skin but I put on a toner and a face moisturizer before this product
This product leaves a very strong white cast. I’m very fair skinned so I didn’t think this is something I’d have to worry about, but it actually looks like white face paint on my skin. I’m very disappointed.
This does not work for dark skin or African American tones. This leaves a white film over your face. There’s no way to rub it in.
Cerveve sunscreen allows me to be in the sun for hours.
Not a fan. It does not spread well at all. It smells like your typical sunscreen and it leaves a horrible white cast. The more you try to rub it in the more it’s just smears around and looks gross.
Disclaimer: I don’t Have sensitive skin. turns out it started to burn and itch and my skin turned pinkish red after 2 hours of putting it on. Sunscreen is very white I had to blend it in with foundation so it wouldn’t be noticeable.
It leaves a terrible white cast, it’s hard to rub in and it drys very quickly. DONT BUY THIS. Maybe it’ll look good under makeup but Um no I’m highly disappointed.
Honestly, the whitecast is outrageous. It does not blend into your skin at all. When you sweat, the sunscreen beeds. It feels like glue, although it does not dry out your skin. Also, it’s sticky. Definitely would not get again.
It is great if you can overlook the white cast
Bought in October ‘20, and just went to open it. Expired in January ‘21. Really?  They’re selling this stuff at the very end of its shelf life. Don’t buy.
Not easy to spread. Leaves a white cast. Not for medium to dark skin tones.
Worst product i ever brought , it makes your skin look like a zombie, like all white, and it doesnt absorb n blend into the skin. Really bad for dry skin
CeraVe has incredible products but this right here is by far worst. The application is too white, pale to the skin. I'm a little disappointed CeraVe
It leaves a white cast, no matter how long I rub it in my hands. It is also greasy, I'll have to throw it away.
This product is NOT for women of color. I’m African American with light skin & I looked like a ghost with this on. I tried rubbing in it circles for five minutes to no avail. Gave it to my mom
This sunscreen feels lightweight, but it has a horrible white cast, and it doesn't blend into the skin. I spent about 10 minutes trying to rub/pat in the sunscreen, but it just balled up on my face.
It’s like putting the white part of clown make-up on and it leaves stain on yoga mats, car arm rests. . .
It left such a bad white caste when I applied it and it was so tough on my skin. I use spf moisturizer religiously. Already issued a refund. So disappointed.
I normally love all cerave products but this sunscreen is terrible. It leaves a white residue all over your face that is impossible to rub in. You have to put makeup over it or you look like an actual ghost.
This sunscreen does not spread well or evenly. If you have any brown skin, it will not blend and will turn your whole face a different shade.
It's not an oily product. Easy to apply
Whiteness film on face
I love it ❤️
This product DOES NOT blend into your skin like other sunscreens or moisturizers. It looks like I’m wearing clown makeup
Really disappointed with this. So thick, difficult to spread, and left me tinted white. Not cute. Definitely returned, and sticking with Elta brand-- worth the money to not look like a ghost.
I don't like this sunscreen. Like it would probably work for the beach, but the white cast it leaves behind is not good for daily use. This is the only CeraVe product I've been unhappy with.
Leaves you looking like Data from star trek
doesn't matter the amount there is a while shinny film on my face so dam disappointed cant wear it at all
This stuff is awful. Doesn’t spread well and leaves white marks all over and that’s coming from someone who is as white as paper
Makes your face white no matter how little you use. Not good for every day use.
absolutely terrible. ive had to mix with other creams and olive oil in hopes of it not appearing like a white sheet on my face. love that it is fragrance-free and doesn't break me out but goodness its not good
This product stays on your face like a paste, it is very thick and remains white and creamy on your face, it does not dissolve
This is the worst sunscreen it leaves a white residue and makes you look of a clown.
Does not run in well. As a fair skinned person I thought I could make it work. Not all. May be excellent primer for clown make up.
I am brown skin, and this sunscreen looks like i applied white makeup on. Its NOT moisturizing at all, either. Waste of my time & money.
Wow. I want my money back. I look like a clown. It looks like I bought white, chalky face paint and smeared it all over.
Needed something safe for my rosacea but it left my skin white like a mime. And felt very thick on skin as well.
Do not buy this product it does not rub in well it will leave your face looking purple if you do not believe me go on youtube and look it up, I am highly disappointed.
After minutes of putting it on my face my face was itchy. It’s so hard to spread, and a white mask on my face, it’s not moisturizing AT ALL. This product is probably not even the real CeraVe.
Unable to use. It leaves a heavy white mask that I can't rub in. I love their products, but this is a disappointment if used for the face.
I need my money back! Leaves awful white cast on my face. If I try to rub it in my skin becomes dry and flaky. It looks like a fake product
It was too chalky looking
Very difficult spread too white and no moisture. I don't like it.
I look like a ghost. Does not easily spread.
Product came in a box that looked used. I can't tell if it was a previous return or something similar but during Covid, I dont feel comfortable using something that feels used. Haven't even tried the product
Extremely think and impossible to blend in. Dried out my skin. Used once and threw it in the trash.
Product leaves a very strong white cast. I have tanned/red skin tone and this product made me look like a light skinned Thanos.Good for cosplaying I guess but wouldn't recommend for any day use.
Great !
Dont get it if you have dark skin- it whitens your skin.
So dry, like rubbing chalk on your face
Horrible to spread on face! Makes you look like Casper the ghost!
Thick and the worst white cast. Hard to spread and it definitely pills. Definitely don’t recommend under makeup. Or on anyone with skin that isn’t fair.
Too much white cast left even when trying to apply in small amounts.
I don’t like this product because it does not melt into my skin. It stays white and makes me look like I’m wearing white face. Thumbs down. 👎 don’t waste your money
It’s terrible makes your face feel so dry and it’s grainy and leaves a horrible white cast
I love the brand Cerave. They make great skin products. This sunscreen is SPF 50 which is a good SPF level. The ingredients are titanium and zinc which are really good. It is a mineral sunscreen which means it is more of a natural product and healthier for you than chemical sunscreen. It also has 3 essential ceramides and niacinamides which are ingredients to promote healthy skin and restore its natural barrier. It won't clog your pores.  It is accepted by the national eczema association. It is not greasy nor does it have a strong scent. The 2.5 ounce is a good size sunscreen. Not too big or small. The thing I don't like about this product is that it is hard to rub in and does leave you with a white complexion. I hope they improve on the consistency and color. Also, it does not say that it is waterproof. I hope they make a waterproof version for the beach or for when you sweat. Overall, this is a great product in that it has many health benefits but it needs to be fine tuned to be an even better product.
prepare to hide home alone with this level of white cast
Leaves a white cast and smells chemically (like Gad station). I’m pretty pale but it made me look like Casper.
Does not moisturize at all. Leaves a white aftertone that looks like a foundation. Bottle had probably 1/4 of the sunscreen missing as well
High quality product at a reasonable cost!
Made my skin purple. Not good for darker skin tones and not easy to spread. But it is a good sun protectant
I normally love CeraVe but damn, the zinc in this product leaves a horrible white cast that doesn't absorb over time and the zinc starts to get patchy which i suspect also leads to poor coverage.
I have very pale, white skin and this sunscreen gave me a horrible white cast! I look like a very sickly vampire. Don't buy this.
This was a terrible product that came open and used. It also came late. I paid $15 for a crap product!
Not sure if it moisturizes or works well as a sunscreen. I never left the house with it because it gave my face a silvery white coating which made me look like a robot.
It just would not blend. After 20 mins of trying, I looked like a ghost!!!! Who made this product though!!! What a shame
Great product hard to find
The texture is very thick and hard to spread. It is powdery and blocks my pores. It whitens my face like vampire after I put it on
We received these in Sept--and just now realized that they expired within 30 days. We can no longer return--very unhappy that old products were shipped to us. Very unhappy
It does not matter how much you rub it in, your face will glow white and pasty.  There are plenty of face sunscreens available that are effective without this effect. Don't bother with this one.
Good product
I really wanted to like this. Its so hydrating and creamy and feels great on my skin, but it being on my skin makes me feel like a ghost lol. So definitely go for this if you’re a more fair person (I’m a light-ish medium asian, for reference) and maybe try their tinted (which is also amazing minus the cap lol) sunscreen if you’re a little darker.
Goes on nice and silky
Left my face stained white and leaves a huge white cast DO NOT get if you are a poc it will stain your face
Doesn't build nicely with other products. It's super WHITE. I really don't recommend this product. Don't even consider it.
Difficult to spread evenly. Leaves a white cast. Gets stuck on in your eyebrows and hairline. Greasy, not moisturizing.
They changed the formula on Cerave 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50.  My husband who has dermatitis was OK with old formula, but not this new one. It flared up his dermatitis... will not use again.
the worst white cast ever. if you are not very fair skinned, it will leave a white cast.
I would not recommend this sunscreen for POC. It leaves a really bad white cast over skin and takes a while to go away.
Creates a significant white caste (i have southeast asian complexion, coffee-colored) and was hard to rub in. Also very thick and greasy. I will not purchase again.
Leaves you with be a white face .It is impossible to blend in your skin .
Amazing product but I almost gave up on it because of the very apparent white cast on my brown skin (I’m Mexican). So glad I did a little research and found out that you can do two things to prevent this…1) apply immediately after a moisturizer: applying to dry skin makes the white cast worse2) apply in small amounts: the directions tell us this as well, but apply little dots to your face and rub them in really well. This should leave your face looking less like Casper
The worse sunscreen ever!! I hated it! Don't spend your money buying it! Isn't easy to spread!! I followed every step to use, and keep horrible!
The sunscreen peels, so have decided to use it on the body
I need to use the very heavy makeup to cover up how white it turns my face to...
hard to spread, left a residue of purple / white on skin 2 days & 2 showers it came off returned .love other cerave products not this one - sorry
Great!!!
I don’t like
It’s terrible ! Greasy makes the skin look dirty and a strong white cast
Awful! Thick and does not spread smoothly. Leaves your face stark white and thick and goopy in eyebrows.
It gives me a horrible white cast even when using a little. It's not even moisturizing for my skin. This is honesty a horrible sunscreen eapecially for people of color.
Terrible product. Do NOT waste your money. Super clumpy and did not at all mix into the skin well. Even with makeup it looked awful.
This product doesn’t blend well with skin and leave white patches which can be seen clearly . I had high expectations with this sunscreen but it made me disappointed.
It is not easy to go on. I had to rub and rub and I still had white all over my face. Will not use again
May be a great sunscreen, but looks horrible on any person of color. If your are brown/black complexion this will definitely leave cast.
Don't buy so white and disgusting you can't even spread it across your face
I did not like this sunscreen. It left an awful white cast and felt really thick!
I did not like it because it is a very dry cream, it does not hydrate the skin on the contrary it makes the skin drier
Leaves my face with a very pale blue like tint. Won’t buy again.
Does not spread out nor does it blend into the skin. Leaves the skin insanely white.
I love the brand Cerave but that's what my husband said when he walked into the room after I put it on. It does not rub in AT ALL.
Goes on BLUE, and stays that color for awhile, also it’s hard to spread due to the consistency of the sunscreen. Would absolutely NOT recommend.
The white cast is unreal. I’m pale and this stuff makes me look dead. It’s a thick paste that doesn’t spread well or rub in.
im not even a dark skinned person and this left such a horrible while cast it was ridiculous
Thought this would be a good product - it's awful.  Will not rub in or absorb - had to scrub my face to get it off. Very disappointing!
Don’t buy this sunscreen it’s awful, does not spreads well, when you try to put foundation on top is patchy and it’s extra white.
Worst product for POC. I tried to rub it in but its so thick. It left my skin greyish/white.  On the plus side, I'm assuming it works.
I wish I could give this 0 stars. Literally doesn’t blend in at all, leaves the most obvious horrible white cast and clings to my dry patches. Horrible product.
Cannot spread at all!!!
I don’t like it, Leave white cast and hard to remove
Not easily blendable; like zinc! Good if you are a lifeguard! Do not recommend...
Cera-Ve Face cream too thick, leaves face ashy white. I tried with makeup and without leaves face looking dry..  I don’t recommended.
if you like the goth look this is probably good.doesn't blend in and leaves your face white.might work, but when friends are asking if you are sick it is time to change to clearer sunscreen.
Left a VERY noticeable white cast (I looked like a ghost) that did not go away with time.
This was too thick and caked on.  Me and my children looked like mimes at the beach.
Smells terrible. Does not spread easily.
DREADFUL white cast, hella sticky. It's too embarrassing to wear out of the house.
Make sure you check the expiration date. Mine was expired 3 months before I received it.
Does not spread well
Your face stays white after applying even at end of day. Ddi not like it at all.
I do not recommend for use on  face.
Leaves a white cast on the skin
Leaves your skin WHITE like glow in the dark out in the sun white
Not a fan, left a thick white layer on the skin and was very drying.
Turned my skin white, mime face paint white. THE SMELL IS THE WORST! Like an old 70’s bar carpet with years of cigarette smoke and dirt. RETURNED!
Not at all hydrating. Leaves an awful “white cast” on face. & Difficult to rub into skin.
Dissatisfied.  The expiration date on the package reads December 2020.  That’s next month.  Very disappointed.  I won’t order again.
Turned m face completely white.  Worked well as a sunscreen especially since I couldn’t leave the house because I looked like I had white clown makeup on!
Bruh this got me looking like the joker. Don’t do it
Left a terrible white cast. I am so pale already but this made me look dead.
Great quality product
This product leaves a white film on your face
Don’t buy. It makes ur face really white 😖😡
I received damaged box and the tube inside was open with sunscreen leaking out.
Literally left me looking like a ghost the cast is so bad! It also left my skin feeling dry so hydrating is a bit misleading. Don’t recommend
This sunscreen made me break out so bad, and it left a blue sheen to my face. I looked like a smurf
Cons - The white case is bad. It’s worse when reapplying and you’re sweaty because it’s hard to apply it evenly.Pros - Doesn’t clog my pores much, especially compared to other SPF brands. When applied on clean skin, it goes on smoothly, not tacky, and my face feels kind of soft. I haven’t applied makeup on top of it, but could see foundation sitting well on top of the sunscreen. It does provide sun protection as it should.Overall, I won’t buy again because of the white cast. I’ll finish my bottle and just use it when I’m working from home next to my window, since I won’t be seeing anyone.
Pasty, leaves a strong white cast and not moisturizing.
Leaves your face looking white and ashy, if you add makeup on top it looks patchy as if you have dead skin all over your face
I didn't like the fact that I had a white tinge to my face.
Great product.
I just received this product, it expired 6 months ago!!!
Turned my skin white. It’s a NO FOR ME!
The product leaves behind a lot of white cast. I am pretty pale already, but it definitely isn't clear on the skin.
Too thick, too heavy!
Leaves a white cast on your face for the majority of the day.
Very good
This sunscreen will leave you looking like Casper 👻
Only redeeming factor of this sunscreen is that it’s easy to scrub off. Worst white cast I’ve ever experienced.
leaves a horrible white cast and it’s hard to spread
Horrible. Leaves my skin super dry and white. Doesn’t spread easily either.
I LOOK CRAZY WITH A WHITE FACE its does not absorb
UHHH... i guess if you want to be a geisha all day this is great.
Not good for darker skin
So difficult to spread , does not mosturize at all ! Worst cerave product
So bad doesn’t work  make your face like clown
Left a long lasting white cast, not happy with it at all. I tried the invisible zinc version and it is so much better, also in spf 50. So that is my go to now.
Is not easy to be absorbed by the skin ☹️☹️ Looks very white
My face is very white after (worse of all I used). It is good as a moisturizer, but only to stay at home.
I’m VERY pale and the white cast is severe even on me. I can’t use it unless I blend it into a darker foundation.
Left white cast and feels so heavy
Yes, it is not greasy but my skin and neck are two different colors.
I gave it a 1 because of the weird white cast it leaves. I had to switch. It’s a no from me
Horrible white cast. Pills easily. Would not recommend
Applying like a chalk . Should have read the reviews of it . Everybody has same problem . Really disappointed
Horrible it leaves a white pasty cast on face I put it under makeup it turned my face green it’s so bad very heavy 😬😧😦😥
Absolutely terrible white cast & I’m pretty pale. Way toooo thick & does not blend at all.
Hated it. Goopy , super impossible to spread , pills . ugh
Left a really ugly white cast and it would not spread and blend , won’t be buying this
Not good for face
Left a white cast so for dark complexions I recommend you try something else first
IT LEAVES A VERY THICK WHITE CAST
Wish I'd seen these reviews before I purchased. I enjoy Cerave face products but I had the same difficulty that is mentioned again and again here - while it is non-greasy (as promised), the sunscreen won't rub into skin completely and leaves a white residue. I looked sickly pale both times I applied it (even after making sure I'd shaken the bottle thoroughly). I'm not able to speak well to the sun protection it provides as I didn't get as much sun as expected the days I wore it.
Has has really bad white cast on darker skin tones
This broke me out like crazy. Leaves a really bad white cast over your face and isn’t moisturizing at all. Would not recommend.
The product wasn’t really moisturizing and would leave a white thin layer on my face which was really noticeable
This took three showers to get off!
Leaves a heavey white cast, for all the talks about this sunscreen I was expecting better, total waste of money
made me breakout n gave me a huge white cast
not good, white, cakes, bad under makeup
The white cast on this is TERRIBLE. This does not blend into my skin, and I wouldn’t recommend this to ANYONE.
Worst product ever. Doesn’t rub or absorb in, leaves a heavy white streak, and I don’t think it even protects from sun.
Severe white cast!!!!! If you are not pale af, do not purchase. I looked like a ghost after putting it on...
Leaves a white cast to your skin
leaves heavy white residue on skin
It felt like face was painted in white, not suitable for dark skin like me lol
Came expired so I cannot use it 😔 sunscreen loses its effectiveness after expiration
Great!... if you want to look purple. 😐
It stays white on your skin.
Leaves a white film on face
Even with a thin layer it did not absorb into my skin and left a white cast over my face.
Leaves a HORRIBLE white cast and I could never rub it in enough for it to not be extremely noticeable.
this product is not black face approve because the leaves are completely white and is not moisturizing it’s super dry and it’s streaky.
It’s not a  good product for darker skinned complexions.  Leaves a noticeable white pasty look on your face.
White cast aside we all got rashes.
Received an expired product.
It left my face super white and dry. I love all the cerave products except this one.
Turns your whole face white and doesn’t blend in to your skin easily.
It's more a white face paint than a sunscreen
Leave a horrible white cast
This is very difficult to apply and dry. It also turns your skin color very ghostly white.
Leaves the worst white cast
super bad white cast
Got expired item and I returned it.
Awful product. Doesn't spread. We can't use it, so I have no idea how to tell you if it works.
made my face super pale :/
Item close to expiration date when received.
Hard to spread & left a VERY noticeable white film on my face
Too sticky and leave white spots
horrible product. left a white caste. don’t waste your money on this.
Don’t waste your money on this!!!!!
The white cast is so bad. Please don’t buy this sun screen, because it’s just not it.
This is thick and greasy. Hard to spread and doesn’t sink into the skin. At all.
Extreme white cast and too thick
Was very cakey and flaked right off.
would return if I hadn't thrown out the packaging!  I like all the other products I've used from this brand.  re-ordered many times
Has a very white cast did not like that
Worst sunscreen ever. Leaves a horrible white cast on your face, makes you look sickly
Super purple looking with a white cast. Doesnt rub out, streaky after a few seconds. 0/10
Leaves a white cast
IT SAYS IS NEW BUT WHEN I RECEIVED IT THE SPF WAS OPENED...
Awful!
Not recommend
It shows up as much too white. I was expecting it to be clear.
I can’t seem to find a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t make me look like a ghost!
This left a ton of white casting. Id suggest a different sunscreen
Makes us look blue.
The item is expired
WHITE CAST
This tube was expiring in 2 months. Disappointed.
Left a white strong  layer on my face
Opened, used product, I received it with almost nothing in the bottle
It doesn’t spread at all leaves your face white.
This is my first Amazon review. A terrible product, white cast on the face and body.
Very thick, doesn’t spread out easily.
White cast on face is noticeable. Look like a mime
For sunblock on face, it doesn’t blend well
it has been used, exp 01/21
It’s not moisturizing, too thick and it’s soooo difficult to spread !
my face was white all over after applying it
Leaves face white hard tp spreadVery sticky
I wouldn’t recommend it leave a white tint
The cream doesn't absorbed into the skin.Look terrible on the face
Thick white past on my face.
I look like The Joker
White cast!!!!!!! Gabuki
I didn’t like how it wouldn’t spread on face
This product makes my face look very oily.
Sting the eyes
Leaves an extremely white cast.
This leaves a white film on your skin.
I bought this thinking it would be good since I already use their standard lotion. I have super sensitive skin so sticking to a brand that I don’t have issues with was the idea. Fortunately I’m not breaking out or anything but the more you rub the sunscreen in, the more it balls up and rubs off your face. It also has a AWFUL white cast that behind! I’m pasty as is, so for it to be so prominent on my skin tone is really bad. Anyone with even slightly darker complexion than mine would never be able to use this. The only reason it’s getting a two star is because I’m not breaking out in hives.
I feel deceived because its very good price at the time I’m looking for a sunscreen. I bought it and hope it will work so that I can save money on suncreen. It turns out a big disappointment. It causes me breakouts and make my face look pale and too white. I don’t recommend it for face!
Worst sunscreen ever. I don't care how much sun protection it may claim. Leaves the worst white cast. Everything I touched turned white. My leggings, black stroller, etc.
It whitened my skin in ways that look very unflattering. It turned my skin purple and immediately has to wash it off.
I absolutely LOVE this to use on my kids faces. They have very fair-skinned. It absolutely DOES leave them very white (but it’s zinc so what do you expect???) but it works very well on them. It is hard to spread and does dry their face out a little, it’s hard to get off in the bath. But all of that is WORTH not having kiddos with burnt faces 🤩
i look like i rubbed white paint on my face. it doesn't absorb into the skin, it doesn't even go on skin very nicely. and then i had to SCRUB it off my face with a lot of force to get the white streaks off. i let it sit for at least 15 minutes and it never soaked in.
Can only wear this sunscreen at home because if I go out in public people think i’m a ghost.  I will not be repurchasing again.
The white cast is just awful!!!! Looks like you’re wearing some sort of face mask(For reference I’m a Fair Ivory skin tone)
I LOVE LOVE LOVE Cerave products. But this stuff sucks. It's like ashy grease paint. It does not feel good on the skin. I guess it provides good sunscreen, but it's currently running off my face, so I'm not even sure about that. I probably need to rub it in more, but it doesn't seem like it wants to absorb. Yes, I understand how mineral sunscreen works, but I might prefer smearing straight zinc across my face.  I even read reviews before purchasing and thought, What the hell? I'm only going to wear it around the house to walk the dog or garden, and I'm super pale anyway. Ugh. I'll use it up, but I don't have to like it.
This is thick and VERY white after application. Probably effective but not ideal. Get a tinted sunscreen. Alternatively I liked Cetaphil brand much better for a mineral sunscreen (better because it sits on top of your skin) that isn't as visible.
I really like Cera Ve body moisturizer. The reviews seemed promising. I was very disappointed. Left me  pasty looking, was hard to spread, and not very moisturizing.
Most disappointing product from CeraVe. Difficult to blend into skin and leaves a white cast all over the face.
First let me start by saying I have extremely fair skin and the white cast this leaves is even ridiculous on me. My sister even commented and I quote "what are you trying out to be a mime" now I expect some white cast with a zinc sunscreen but I've never had it this bad. Also This is extremely hard to even apply almost like it's drying down the second it touches your face and hard to move around after. CeraVe usually makes such great products so I was surprised at how awful this one was.
What a terrible product. Smears instead of spreads and leaves a terrible cast all over, all while not actually protecting from the sun. How is it possible I'm covered in this crap and yet sunburned? This product does not work.
Is not good is feels so Hard when you put it on,and you face is turn to blue color  not good. Don't waste you money
Pros: does a good job of protecting skin from the sun. Ideal to use after procedures like Bluelight, spider vein removal and skin peeling.Cons: ALL mineral based sun screens leave a white mask on your face. And this one is no different. You will look like an actor in a Chinese opera. And it doesn't fade over time. It's there until you wash it off. Applying a thin layer makes you less white but decreases the effectiveness of the cream.
CeraVe should improve this formulation. It is very difficult to disperse even if you apply an oil before or mix with another cream. I tried everything but helpless. White residues remain all over your face. I will try to consume on hands or decollete where there is less attention.
It was Turing face in to blue. It was very difficult to spread. It big no for holidays if your looking for photos
I have sensitive and dry skin. I try my best with hydration and sunscreen. I love most Cerave products but hate this one. It is hard to spread, dries out my skin, and leaves that white caste that won’t budge or dissolve.
Difficult to apply, feels drying, major white cast. I hate wasting products, but I threw this in the trash.
Agree with others that this is not for people of color. Any amount of color/pigmentation. If you have very pale skin and are okay with looking like matte white paint, this may work for you. I could not work it into my skin as it dries quickly and does not appear to absorb, but rather sits mostly on the surface. It literally looked like a beauty cream mask ladies go to sleep with. I arrived at my daughter's track meet and it still had not absorbed, after 30 minutes, and would not budge. Too embarrassed to be seen like that, I went home to scrub it off with soap. Had to soap, scrub and rinse 3 times to get it all off.  I did not buy this on Amazon but at CVS Pharmacy on the way to the meet. Worst sunscreen I have ever worn (probably effective though).
We have used Cerave sunblock on our son’s sensitive skin for many years and it works great in terms of blocking the sun and preventing burns.  Unfortunately I have been unable to use it due to having a relatively dark complexion, especially during the summer - the previous versions of Cerave would always leave a white residue - even when I applied as the bottle directs.This sunscreen is specially formulated for use on the face. The key is to not apply it too thickly.  I place a very small amount between me thumb and the pads of my first 2 fingers and rub them back and forth prior to massaging it into a small area of my face at a time.  This can not be applied like your typical sunscreen or it will create a white sheen.I’ve found that it doesn’t have to be applied heavily to be effective.  This is a good product for moderately sunny days but it’s not what I’d use on full days on the beach.This is a quality product and works well as long as long as it’s not over-applied.  This just isn’t the easiest sunscreen to use.
They charged me $21 for the 2.5 oz and came with no sealed and the outer cover already opened. Looks like somebody used it. No expire date. I didn’t know what to to with this product? Keep it or not coz looks like it already used.and also there is no option for return.
this leaves quite the white-cast. I probably won't buy again, but I will use it for outdoors/gardening- just not when I go out in public XDon the upside, I don't notice any stinging and the texture is nice
While this Cerave facial sun screen is advertised as being the number one recommended brand by dermatologists, there are some things that keep it from being a five star product.First and foremost, it is thick and hard to work in. One B, it leaves you looking like you have white make-up on, think Goth or a geisha perhaps. This isn't the look my fair-skinned gf was seeking. It's thick and eventually cakes up when coupled with sweat and daily wear and tear can look kind of terrible.On the other hand, it does sun protect, the price is fair, and it doesn't leave you feeling too greasy. It's a mixed bag.
I love this brand and the thought of natural products. The instructions leave me feeling confused. Do I sacrifice skin protection so I do not look like I am wearing white lead paint from the Elizabethan period or do I embrace the look white and for superior protection? The interior application tips even contradicts itself.First, it says to apply small amounts to an area and then rub it in well to reduce the appearance pf the white cast. Then it says to apply liberally for sun protection. I have tried to do both. However, that does not work. I have found that my favorite way to use this product is to use it when I am going to be wearing a makeup foundation so I can counter the white cast with my foundation.** Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review.I hope the information that I've provided helps to make your decision a little easier.If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘Helpful’ button below.
my B-I-L who has a skin condition called “VITILIGO”, aka Palamino syndrome.  This is a life long condition where the pigment is lost from the skin and becomes highly sensitive.  He’s mostly affected on the arms and face and needs sunscreen year round.This Mineral sunscreen is a barrier type product.  All of those complaints about the white residue are actually complaining about the very thing that blocks the sun completely.  Folks that absolutely need that protection understand.  It will wash off when you’re done bring out in the sun.  While you’re in the sun, you can SEE if you’re properly protected.  It’s not as obvious as straight zinc oxide, nowhere close.There is a bit of a smell to the lotion, not exactly a fragrance cause it’s not really pleasant.  The lotion goes on without too much difficulty, altho’ it’s a bit drying.  It does what it’s supposed to do - it blocks the sun.  The tube is easy to handle ‘cause it’s not shiny plastic; a small thing that matters with lotiony hands.All things considered, a product worthy of consideration for your sunscreen needs✨
Because this sunscreen is a physical rather than a chemical sunscreen it is going to give your skin a white sheen - that is how it works. Unfortunately, I found that this sunscreen in addition to giving my skin a white sheen also left my skin feeling sticky. I did not like that sensation. It smells like lotion rather than smelling like sunscreen which to me is a positive. It is great protection from the sun.
I was looking for an everyday sunscreen for my face and heard this was a good option. The very first day I used it I realized that it left a lot of white cast behind. I've been using it everyday since Im currently working from home thanks to being quarantined, but I will most likely have to find a better option that I can wear under my make up once I eventually go back to work in the office.
I put this on and immediately looked like a mime.  I'm sure it would look fine with makeup over it, but then why not buy the Cerave tinted sunscreen?  I wouldn't even put this on my 6 year old.. I don't care how much protection it offers, it looked hideous.  I immediately regretted my decision.  Back it goes!!!!
Works well for sun coverage but be prepared to look like your face is painted. Even with minimizing the amount applied and rubbing it in well. My whole family is Hispanic and we all looked quite pasty. I find this to be common with mineral based sunscreens but not all. We will keep this for emergencies and use just for lower extremities.
I'm giving this sunscreen 4 stars for now though I haven't had an opportunity to give it the acid test which is wearing it while playing tennis in the hot sun during the summer.  I have to wear a good sunscreen that will keep my skin safe from damaging sun rays but will not sting my eyes should it run into them.  I don't know if this sunscreen will sting or not and it doesn't say anything about that on the box.  I like Cerave lotions and have used a lot of them in the past including sunscreens so I expect this sunscreen to work well.  If it doesn't I will be back to update this review.
While the product is easy to spread and I felt protected from the sun, it leaves way too much residue on your face. Especially since I have dark skin, even a little amount is obvious. I bought because of the essential ingredients it contains, but I don't think I can continue wearing during the day.
I have dry, sensitive skin and I have used lots of sunscreen but never found anything like this. Its the worst of them all. I always research tons of time before buying any product and the only reason I bought this product was because I was on a hiking trip and I forgot to pack my usual sunscreen and had to go to a nearby store to my hotel and pick any sunscreen that I could find. Although there were 3-4 other sunscreens present in the store but the reason I picked this is because its from CeraVe. But please don't get fooled like me. I love all the CeraVe products especially their AM sunscreen but this is way different from that product. This product leaves the worst white cast, very difficult to spread and extremely difficult to get off. I tried to mix it with my daily moisturizer and although it become easy to apply, it is still very difficult to remove. I use retinol in the night which is why I avoid using AHA/Salicyclic facewash and I use CeraVe hydrating facewash but its very difficult to get it off with that and even with AHA facewash it doesn't come off. I can try using cleansing balms to remove it but its just like adding an extra step/product in my nighttime routine. Stay away from this product.
This stuff leaves white residue behind. I didn’t like how thick and greasy it felt so I thought it wouldn’t be good for my face. So far I’ve used on my arms and legs.
I tend to burn easily and always use an SPF of 50 for my face especially. this brand is one of the few that contains zinc oxide and that is the ingredient I look for to make sure I get the level of protection that I want. This is also one of the acceptable brands that is OK to use in places such as Hawaii where they want to protect their reef coral, etc. and require certain types so it's safe for marine life.This is lightweight and goes on easily and it does give your face a white look. It does have some moisturizing effects. One thing to note, however, is that you will likely have a hard time using it under foundation or any other makeup. I do reapply every 2 hours when I'm out during the day especially when by water.
All good sun protection products have zinc oxide. Zinc is the key ingredient! And zinc is why the product is so white on the face. The good news: before applying to face, first rub this product and a regular light moisturizing lotion (e.g. Vanicream light moisturizing lotion) together in your hands. Now it will absorb well into your skin.
This leaves a grayish cast to the skin. You look a bit like a zombie film cast member. So okay for outdoor sports, but not for daily regular wear. Very difficult to remove as well.
This is a good product if you are looking for protection.I use it when I run on the trails for about 1 hour and does not get any sunburn on my face. I tend to get very red and then dark when I get sun.I do not like to tan, therefore I stay away from the sun as much as I can but I do enjoy working out outside so I need a good skin protector.I have not used it under make up but I doubt I could. I have oily skin and this would make my face oilier under makeup.It is thick and will not spread as water but it's not pasty neither. I didn't have an issue spreading it.It is white but will fade away shortly.I would definitely use it for the beach or a day outside when I am not wearing make up.
So disappointed in this sunscreen…extremely difficult to rub in.  After warming up the product by rubbing my palms together & applying to my face, it left a whitish residue on my skin. I finally had to remove it with a warm washcloth. What happened Cerave?  Are you reading the reviews? Their products are usually of the highest standard!  Seriously need to "redo & improve" this product.
Like all “physical” and mineral sunscreens that contain zinc and/or titanium dioxide, they will without a doubt leave the dreaded whitecast. However this sunscreen does NOT absorb and does not blend into your face at all. Even when it is rubbed in and somewhat absorbed ~10 minutes later, the whitecast is still so visible it renders this product as unusable.At best I would use this sunscreen strictly for a beach or lounge outside day as a BODY spf.If you’re into CeraVe products, maybe try their tinted version of this. I haven’t used that but it can’t be any worse than this one.
I was recommend by my dermatologist to use CeraVe sunscreen 50 SPF after I removed 3 moles (possible skin cancer). This product is made with clean ingredients without making me teary. But, this sunscreen is thick and hard to rub in on my face completely. It is a moisturizing version of CeraVe’s previous version which I didn’t like. I like this sunscreen a lot better. This sunscreen would be appropriate to fair to medium skin tone people. Because this sunscreen will change your (brighten up) your skin tone slightly. Overall, I am happy with the result after applying this sunscreen. Much better than most other sunscreen that I’ve tried so far. I would recommend. Also, I would recommend this sunscreen especially for kids because this sunscreen is very lightweight, moisturizing also.
Leaves a whitish tinge so mixing it with foundation
Pills on the skin and too much white cast
Nothing
This earns one star instead of zero because the ingredients are really great and it provides good sun protection. It has a very intense white cast on my very pale skin. It also rubs off very easily - say if you happen to barely touch your face. Not only does it come off easily on my fingers (and get all over my keyboard), but it's sticky and gets all over clothes. I would avoid this unless it was the only sun protection option on earth or I was beginning a Kabuki career.
LORD HAVE MERCY ... IM SURPRISED WITH CeraVe 😳..., AHHH MAYBE ITS GOOD FOR THE 31 OF OCTOBER  TO LOOK LIKE A GHOST ... OMG SO SO THICK ... WHY ?  JESUS 🤦‍♀️  I FELT I PUT PLASTER ON MY FACE !!!  I SUFFER FROM ROSACEA AND ACNE SO I HAVE ENOUGH WITH HAVING THAT ISSUE AND MY MEDICATIONS ... BUT THIS 🤮. I LOVE THIS BRAND BUT THEY SHOULD TAKE THIS OFF THE SHELVES ... THICK AS HELL 👎
I received this Cerave SPF by mistake.  I had ordered the tinted one. But I decided to keep it because I love Cerave products.  It leaves a terrible white cast.  It's hard to spread.  It stings.  I hate to waste products so I've started using it on my hands since it's also moisturizing and have been enjoying as a hand moisturizer/sunscreen. But definitely not. for the face.  The tinted version is lovely.  I will not be buying this one again.
I’m Asian with light-beige skin tones and this sunscreen has the worse white cast I’ve ever seen! I look like a mime every time I wear this! It’s also drying, chalky, and impossible to blend. Great ingredients such as ceramides, but horrible formulation.If it’s going to look chalky and white on my light skin, it will look worse on darker skin tones.How dare they label this sunscreen as “invisible zinc”... what a joke !
I like how it’s SFP 50 which is good but it does leave a weird smell and a white caste on your face so don’t get the product if you don’t mind having a white caste on your face. When you’re done applying it, you can feel the texture of the product so you have to wash your hands after applying it.
20/Mar/2020PROS+ It's mositurizing.+ You can feel the protection!!+ Grade of protection is great.+ Used it for pool, did not get burnt from the sun.+ It does not feel greasy.CONS- Not easy to spread, it's very thick, really.- Leaves a bit of white cast behind (But not too bad).I am giving this one 4/5!* I will update this review if something changes as I keep using the product.* If you found this review helpful, please click below! This will help other users like you to make informed decisions before spending their money!
This product is a very effective sun block, but if you are a person of color like myself, brace yourself for some...umm... comical results. If that weren't bad enough, the stuff is nearly impossible to wash off, even with straight bar soap and a bath pouf...maybe dish soap would have worked better. My skin is a little on the dry side, and this sun block seemed to contribute to the problem. Overall, not a pleasant experience.
So the sunscreen worked well, but you literally can't wear it without makeup unless you're a vampire... Or John MacLean. I'm pretty white as it is, and usually I can get away with sunscreens with a cast, but not this one. I had a solid white face. Dried nice and matte though, and layering wasn't that big of an issue, I just don't want to HAVE to wear foundation every single day.
This is a quality mineral face sunscreen.  It goes on smoothly, moisturizes well and provides great protection.  It doesn't irritate my wife's sensitive skin which is a huge reason we look for these kinds of sunscreens.A couple things to note though.  This isn't a waterproof formula and as such washes off quite nicely with water and soap but is therefore obviously not swim or sweatproof.  Also, even when fully rubbed in, this seemed to leave my wife's skin a little whiter than other high quality mineral sunscreens.All in all, we would buy this again.
So I have been using this for awhile now and it defines isn't the best sunscreen out there. I mix it with my bb cream to even out the white cast and it works well in terms of sun protection. BUT it does break ny face up in the most ridiculous little acne bumps so clearly it clogs pores. Also after few hours I literally shine like a diamond lol. Ut is fragrance free, but I actually can smell some ingredients and it's ok, it doesn't smell like your typical sunscreen. All in all I don't think I'll repurchase,  but I'll definitely finish it
This sunscreen is difficult to spread evenly on your face. It's too white and can rub off onto your clothes. Tried applying it on face many times but didn't look good at all. So tried to use it on other body parts but it would just rub off. Entire car seat is covered in this sunscreen after sitting on it. Would not recommend.
Definitely not the one for daily use, it made me a completely different shade and the white cast is so hard to get rid of. I will say tho it actually feels like my skin is protected against the sun but the way it lays on the skin is like a thick clay paste that smudges around and looks rlly streaky.
I have tried a lot of sunscreen products and I lean more towards mineral sunscreens in order to protect my skin from potentially harmful chemicals. Honestly, I would have returned this product if I could. It's too greasy for my combination skin and the white cast on my olive tone skin is horrific! Good for zombie make-up. I'll save it for Halloween.
Super thick. Didn't absorb at all after a bike ride in the sun. I guess that's good because it stays on your face and makes a shield.The bad thing is that it makes me look like a vampire sucked out all my blood and will shortly be joining the rigor mortis brigade.This is not an everyday sunscreen for those with melanin.
This sunscreen works.It is high-end and excellent quality.I'll keep getting it to keep me and my family healthy and happy.Cerave is a brand I've come to trust and plan to keep using.~ Kort
Horrible to apply, does not blend at all, leaves an extremely obvious white mask. Even after applying makeup it’s impossible to blend it in. Even the palest of people would probably still look even more pale. It’s like white paint. Does protect well against sun, I’m only able to wear it at home though.
Leaves a white cast.  Cannot be rubbed in.  You will look like a ghost all day.  Clogged my pores and caused breakouts.  Have to scrub my face to remove it.  But, it stays on when swimming and you won’t get sunburned.
I’m Indian and have probably been sunburned ~10 times in my life, but still wear sunscreen often. I bought this from the drugstore without testing it - BIG mistake. A small amount of sunscreen can cover my face and body but it appears as if I smeared white paint all over myself. It lightens my face in a way that looks similar to clown makeup. It’s very difficult to rub in and it feels more like it’s sitting on my face rather than rubbed in. I don’t want to waste the product or my money so I’ll be using it when I go out on runs, except it doesn’t do well with sweat either - it collects in my elbow area after sweating. Excited to finish this up and toss it.
It left an insane white cast on my face. I thought it wouldn’t because I’m white but even I wasn’t spared from looking like a Victorian ghost.
Dear God this stuff is terrible for everyday use lmao. And, of course, it had to be the one time I didn't research a product extensively beforehand that it's THIS bad. Metallic smell, understandably so, but it lasts pretty much the entire time I have it on. It literally feels like a nasty, tacky foundation the entire time you have it on: STEER CLEAR if you can't stand the feeling of makeup on your face, because this is exactly like it. Do I even need to mention the white cast??? I had so many people ask me what the hell was wrong with my face over the course of a single day that I pretty much haven't worn it since. Saving it as a reminder to always always ALWAYS research before buying. It does its job decently, but the cons outweigh the pros so, so much that it'd be best to look elsewhere. A much better mineral sunscreen to look for is Purito's.
It’s dry and leaves white stain. I followed the directions and watched a video too, but still leaves the white stain
Sure you may be protected from the sun, but you look like you tried to use white face paint as a moisturizer.
Great protection, no negative reaction, goes on smoothly. However, it makes me look like I am wearing clown makeup on my face and neck!
Do not buy if your dark skin!!! This product will leave your face looking ashy and dry.
As someone with eczema, CeraVe products are a life saver. Chemical sunscreens burn my skin, so grabbing this one seemed like a no brainer. I was so wrong. I’ve tried to use this 6 times and figure out how to not make it white, streaky, and pill free. Every time I came away with horrible looking results. I am incredibly pale and the white cast still is incredibly prevalent. It’s impossible to use.
It's super white almost blue.... not for my skin color.....
This has been the only sunscreen I’ve used that doesnt clog my pores, break me out or causes those itchy pumps. However, it’s hard to blend and leaves on a white cast. If they would come out with a tinted version of this my life would be complete!
White cast
We use this sunblock because its the only thing my 8 year old can use and not welt up with. We have even tried the blue lizard mineral sunblock and she is extremely allergic to it. We love the cereve because its easy to apply and goes on smooth and doesn't bother her skin. Wish it was waterproof though.
I absolutely loathe this stuff. It is thick, uncomfortable and beyond chalky. I would take 1 drop and mix with 1 drop of foundation. When I went to the dermatologist she would say, “Wow. You wear a lot of makeup.” Um, no. (Granted she was an idiot). It was by far the WORST sunblock I have ever used on my face. I cannot tell you to run away far enough. By the way... I am extremely fair skinned and it STILL made me look like I had clown paint on. Horrible stuff.
Tried this twice, once by applying before leaving work for the day. It was difficult to spread, left streaky white cast, and hate the smell. I thought it might work better if I applied it right after doing my morning skincare, with my skin freshly hydrated. So I applied as the last step and it was slightly less difficult to spread. Still left a streaky white cast, still smelly. I guess this gives you the best SPF because after you apply it you'll want to put a bag over your head before you go out into the world.
It works just like any other sunscreen but the white cast that it leaves when you have it on is AWFUL! I'm using quite a few CeraVe products and they are rather good, but this sunscreen isn't something that I would ever recommend. I know people who use Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with SPF 35, and it works so much better in their opinion. It also doesn't leave a white layer after applying so that's what I'm buying next. This CeraVe sunscreen just isn't worth the money that you pay...
This new formulation goes on white and disappears as it is absorbed. I like the old formulation because the zinc is completely invisible.
This is the worst sunscreen I have ever used. I have the body lotion version and it’s terrible. Not only does it leave a white cast that is awful. Like AWFUL. I’m not a very tan person but this sunscreen makes me look sickly. Incredibly pale. It’s thick and hard to spread and rub in. The only reason it gets even one star is that it protects from the sun. But it’s terrible in literally every other way. Lol
I use several if their products and love them and was excited to give this a try. I didnt think it was possible for me to look more pale but it is. I applied and rubbed this in...and rubbed...and it never blended in. Rather it left a cast so white that in certain light it is a tiny bit purply. Ugh. Coverage was good and it felt lite o,n but geesh. Not gonna work for me.
Trust me you guys it’s better to find another drugstore sunscreen or higher end product. I don’t know how well it fares in the heat or it’s protective qualities but THIS PRODUCT LEAVES THE MOST HORRENDOUS WHITE CAST. Even with my very pale skins, I applied dabs like I normally would went to pat in and looked like Casper. If you want it to blend out YOU CAN’T. Harsh rubbing may do the trick but that’s not good for your skin! Avoid hunny!
I still purchased this after seeing Dr.Dray’s video  and reading all the negative reviews, because I could not believe it would be thaaat bad. It really truly is. I usually love cerave products, and trust them for my sensitive/acne prone skin.This formula is utterly disappointing. Chalky and stiff, really hard to spread and layer on the skin. Feels more drying and harsh than hydrating. The white cast is honestly horrific and does not blend at all. I can’t imagine this being flattering or blendable on any skin tone, considering it is so streaky. Even on the fairest skin it would be heavy and noticeable.Best to avoid this product altogether until they change the formula.Very upsetting for Cerave
Seriously this is the first Cerave product that has ever disappoint me. I have a #2 skin tone, very fair, the white cast residue in this product is so intense it makes my face ghostly pale white. It is so hard to spread on skin surface, leading to a heavy rubber-like feeling all day long. I also feel like all this contributes to my pores appearing bigger and more define. I would not recommended.
Not only is this not sensitive skin safe and leave you feeling like you're basking in a pool of acid, it doesn't rub in leaving you looking like you were unwillingly whisked away on your with the Wild Stallyns after they defeated you in Battleship, Clue and twister.Sure it'll protect you from the skin but you could also just wear a mud mask and get the same effect.
If you love that Kabuki Theater look, you'll love CaraVe Spf 50 for face. If you want to walk into a party and have your friends think you and on a went long coke bender, buy this product. If you want to look so pale your boss to think you've been up all night vomiting and need to go home immediately, invest in CareVe spf 50 for face.
Like others have said, this leaves a very white residue. I’m bummed to have spent the money buying this at a store, wondering if I’m using it wrong (I mean, it’s sunscreen, so how many ways can it go?) and coming here to find the same reviews.  I wanted this to work so badly because the ingredients are highly recommended by my derm.
How, how, HOW did this product get so many good reviews? I did not buy this from Amazon but bought from my local grocery store. It. Is. The. Worst. I generally love CERAVE products but THIS goes on thick, sticky and white plus leaves this HORRENDOUS  film on your skin. Do not buy this unless you’re looking for that kind of application.
I was so disappointed because I usually love the CeraVe products, but this just isn't it. I didn't find it moisturizing at all. It's almost as if the sunscreen will not rub in and then dries on your face leaving you looking like you're dressing up as the Scream character for Halloween. Take this warning and buy anything else  except this.
I’m disappointed that anyone at CeraVe who formulated this product could allege that it is “moisturizing.” Not just one’s face, but this sunscreen will dry out one’s arms, legs, etc., as well.Further, it leaves an unmistakable white matte on one’s skin including one’s face. Maybe it offers sun protection but at what cost? To look like Casper the Ghost?!
It made me look like a drowned or frozen corpse. Sorry I didn't take a picture but I was distraught. I'm asian/white mix, and after applying I had very pale skin with a blue/green tinge. After rinsing and wiping most of it away, it still looked really bad.It looked bad enough that it will do nicely at halloween.
Horrible. Left a ghostly white cast. I’m pale as heck and I looked like sick as hell. It wouldn’t rub off either as it dried and caked quickly. It’s a fail for me. I’m so turned off I won’t buy cerave spf anymore as there are so many options nowadays. I bought into the TikTok hype unfortunately
I had the MOST trouble with this sunscreen. It never rubbed into my face! Eventually I gave up and started using another one cause I literally could not rub it in enough so I didn't look like I had PAINTED my face white. I would stay away from this product at all cost.
As soon as you put it on, its like white face paint. The sunscreen clumps up into white threads on your face and you can't spread the suncreen on your face. Added water to it, still wouldn't spread. Had to wash my entire face & removed it. Horrible. Do not waste your money.
Worst sunscreen I’ve ever used! Stay white, Super sticky feeling. Can not put it on my face It never absorb so I wear it on my body instead because I dont want to wasted money but after 30 mins swimming my skin still burn. DONT by this sunscreen!!
I bought this product for motorcycle use. Used first only on my arms - it made me look ghastly WHITE all day, BUT my arms were the only area not burned - at all! So, I was going to leave a glowing review, but first I used it on my face, neck, shoulders, back, and chest the next day. Perfect protection again. BUT, and this is a BIG BUT, 3-4 days later, I broke out EVERYWHERE I put it. I have pimples 8n places I've NEVER had them before (even as a teenager). Day 5, still new, big ones popping up. I could deal with the horrible white, vampire look for protection, but this is UNHEALTHY. I'll be throwing the rest out. :(
This makes me look SO GREASY!!  Honestly it’s more greasy looking than regular, commercial sunscreen for your body. Looks like I rubbed oil on my face. It’s tinted but provides no real coverage.  I only use if it I’m going to hang out in my backyard.
My problem with this sunscreen is that it feels very dry and I have to put a lot on to get the proper sun protection. But most of all, I have a problem with the white cast. The white cast is horrendous. I look like Casper's aunt!
I normally stick to Kbeauty products and decided to try CeraVe for all the hype. This stuff was literally so sticky, thick, and hard to spread and left the weirdest blueish-white whitecast on my face and I'm already super pale, so I can't imagine this working for medium or darker skin tones. I tried it out for about 10 days but it was terrible.
I got a sample size of this and figured I’d try it out since my regular sunscreen is only 30 spf. After day one I didn’t notice anything troublesome and was happy with it. After day 2, I noticed small itchy red bumps on my cheeks and other small bumps on my forehead and chin which were the main areas I had applied this sunscreen. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and unfortunately this sunscreen screwed up my skin more than it did help it. Now I have to try and get my skin back to normal. Don’t bother if you have very sensitive skin, it will cause a rash.
This is the worst sunscreen I have ever had! Doesn’t spread as it should, leave a white layer on my face and it is not uniform, so makeup looks really bad on it. Also leave a peeled appearance. I have been using sunscreen for over 15 years and I have never used one as bad as this one. Sorry CeraVE I love your product but this one is trash
To all my people off color: STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS SUNSCREEN! This sh1t turns you purple! I tried blending it out for at least 5 minutes and the white/purple cast was still very obvious. I’m warning you
My doctor gave me some of this stuff, and I laughed out loud when I put it on. It is a thick opaque, rubbery, substance that will never vanish into you skin.
The worst sunscreen I’ve put on. I love most CeraVe products, but I think this is not formulated well at all. The only people that would use this are surfers maybe on their nose. Otherwise go for another sunscreen that is formulated with more up to date ingredients.
Definitely wouldnt buy again left my face white and crumbled of white on my face didnt rub in very easily left a noticeable white line around my hairline and eyebrows caked in creases around my nose and other wrinkles I would definitely recommend buying there 30spf facial moisturizer runs in easier and doesnt leave a film
Does not rub in and leaves white cast. Good sun protection if you want to have white tinted skin all day and marks on your clothes where it rubs off.
CeraVe used to have a fantastic face sunscreen that smoothed on easily and left no white cast. They discontinued that one and replaced it with this tube of clown paint.
This is a review for CeraVe 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 | Face Sunscreen with Zinc Oxide & Titanium Dioxide for Sensitive Skin.I can’t say enough good  things about this product. My dermatologist has long recommended CeraVe and I have been using their soaps and moisturizing creams for years.This is the first time I’ve used this sunscreen and it’s just fabulous; by far the best I’ve ever used. The cream dispenses easily and a little bit goes a long way. The best thing is that it makes my skin feel so soft - not like most thick sunscreens but instead as if this was a moisturizer only.Highly recommended. This will be my go-to sunscreen from now on.
I am the palest of the pale, and this still left an awful white/grey cast on me. Had to mix it with moisturizer to make it nog as awful, which probably just diluted the sun screen
This leaves a white cast like 90% of the reviews mention and I’m medium skin tone.  I purchased this at Walgreens and assumed it was like any other facial sunblock so I applied it at work without looking at my reflection and then realized why I was being stared at.  Whoops.I even tried it as the directions state and the white cast would not go away.I bought it as a buy one get one 50% off so I decided to make the best of it.  I added this to my facial moisturizer as well as clear gel hyaluronic acid to help dilute the product a little and so far so good.  I don’t know if that’s an approved method but for me it worked.
Impossible to blend this into skin - super white all day long. Awful.
This is quite simply a zinc oxide mask. Isn’t creamy, doesn’t absorb. Made me look like a goth geisha. Totally unusable for normal life. And it burns. Worst sunscreen I’ve ever bought.
Leaves a white tome on the skin very noticeable. Feels heavy
Leaves a horrible white cast.  Won’t buy again very disappointed.
This is the worst facial sunscreen I have ever used. It cakes like crazy, and makes you look like a ghost! Avoid...
Please ignore negative reviews. The reason why people rated this low was because they do not understand what they are buying. First of all, this is SPF 50. Very high sun protection. The only thing that may have a higher SPF than this is Zinc Oxide. OF course this is thicker and whiter that most cheap sunscreen products. Why, because it protects your skin better than those cheap oils and lotions. You buy this for SKIN PROTECTION, not to be a fashion plate! You will see some lifeguards with thick white Zinc OXIDE on their noses, cheeks and ears. Why? Because it shields those areas from the burning UV rays of the SUN.This product is recommended by top dermatologists. There has to be a reason why.
The only way I can use sunscreen as a mineral sunscreen. The ones with chemicals make me break out. This one really works and keeps me from burning when I'm swimming.
High white cast😭😭😭
Would give it zero stars if I could. Worst sunscreen I have ever used. Unless you want to look like a snowman who just took a lot of meth, I advise you to stay away from this one.
I started breaking out after using this creaM and my face looks white after applying this cream won’t recommend to anyone
I have dry skin and I just mixed it with my moisturizer when applying and I had no problem with the white cast on my face and I wouldn't say that it dried my skin out either.
This sunscreen is nice!Firstly, this sunscreen is rated at 50 SPF which provides decent protection from the sun.Next, this sunscreen hydrates dry skin and that's what stands out in this sunscreen to me compared to others. Briefly, I like that.Lastly, it's a mineral based sunscreen which is better if you have sensitive skin.Overall, I enjoy using this sunscreen!There's not much more to say.
I have white skin the product is difficult to apply and leaves you with a white layer similar to theater face paint
I am so happy with this CeraVe  products! I haven’t been able to test out the sun protection qualities as it’s still winter where I live. However, given the history of these products I am sure it’s going to be amazing! The moisturizer it’s self is great it’s easy to spread and it goes on smooth. It leaves your skin feeling really moisturized and healthy.
It’s a white goo, how can you go out of the house in this? Unless you’re 10 years old. It doesn’t matter how easily it spreads or anything else. Still looking for Mr Right Sunscreen.
With so many ingredients placed into sunscreens these days, it’s hard to know if you are actually getting protected from the sun or endangering yourself with applying so many chemicals. Thankfully, this sunscreen offers protection with natural minerals for sensitive skin and eliminates the guessing game for applying chemicals on your skin which are questionable. It also allows for less drying and more moisture so it would be good for daily use (not just beach and hiking time!). It’s fragrance-free and paraben free, so it’s a keeper!
This has all the good stuff you need! To prevent the "white-caulky-look" some people have, wash your face as normal in the morning, and leave a wet face. Don't dry it. Put on your thinnest products first, ie: serums, then apply the thicker creams, such as sunscreen. Not only will you prevent any "white" look, but it soaks into your skin better. This locks in moisture!! Don't believe me, try it! Also ask your dermatologist if you should do it this way. It works!This is a great product. Cerave is a must on any of their items!
CeraVe Hydrating Sunscreen 50 Face is another exceptional product.  It contains both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.  It is oil-free, fragrance free and chemical filter free. I would not necessarily advise to wear under your makeup to work. Yes, it does leave a white cast. This is for those of us who love to be outside and want safe, reliable protection without harmful chemicals.
Hey!! I saw all the bad reviews and I think I can help! So this sunscreen does have a brutal white cast...however, if you put the sunscreen into your hands and rub it together..breaking it down AND THEN put it on your face..it reduces the white cast. I’ve also noticed that it has made my face so soft after the last couple weeks of using. I love it!
I'll admit, when I was younger I only ever put sunscreen on my face when I went to the pool. Now that I'm getting older I'm starting to regret that.  I can't magically fix the damage that's already been done but I can work towards better skin from now on and I think this CereVe will help. It's got good protection as a sunscreen, goes on smooth and doesn't feel oily or anything, and my face feels soft all day.
At first, this looked like a sunscreen that gives that pale white clown face tint.  Oh well.  But after about two minutes, it must have soaked into my skin a bit because that pallor went away -- I looked normal.  Went outside for about two hours, worked fine.  Didn't feel hot and sticky.  Not something to wear under makeup, but good for sports.
This sunscreen goes on smooth and rubs in easily. It stays put, even on sunny and humid days, without running into the eyes. Although it is mineral-based, it doesn’t feel heavy or have a strong scent.Most important, it protects against burning without irritation, and is gentle enough to reapply as needed. And when your day is done, it washes off cleanly — no clogged pores.
I like to use sunscreen under makeup, especially for a few precancerous spots that I have. This is a really good protective sunscreen, but not quite light enough to disappear under makeup without some extra rubbing in. For the beach or bicycling or walking in the sun, this is great. Recommended for outdoor use.
It is very thick and leaves a white cast, but I like it because it's moisturizing
Yes, it makes you whitish. Yes it gets on your clothes if you're not careful and don't wait 10-15 minutes after application.That said, it is the only sunscreen that allows me to go out hiking all day without burning. It protects my face, where I once had problems with skin-c spots, and has given me back my ability to hike. I just put my makeup on over it after I dry and let my arms and legs be whitish. Appearance matters less to me than health and the ability to be outdoors!
This is my favorite product. Does a good job of protecting. Fits my skin tone perfectly. Will definitely repurchase.
have used it only once today, and it wasn't bad
I put on sunscreen religiously.I absolutely hate this sunscreen for it’s misleading “hydrating, non-greasy” sell.It’s anything but hydrating. I have dry skin and was looking for a sunscreen that would be hydrating while I’m protecting my skin. Well, there’s definitely no moisture coming out of my skin because I feel like I put on a thin layer of clay. And yes, I only used a small amount.It’s my own fault for not reading that there was zinc in here when I bought it. I knew I’d turn a little white but JESUS I’m so white.Idk, wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re an avid outdoorsman. It’s not a daily thing to apply unless you enjoy the pasty, clay look.My poor eyebrows are saturated in this now.
I was really happy to see that there was a Cerave 50 SPF, since I love the brand.  But this one, isn't for people of colour.  These experts tell us - get a mineral sunscreen.  So I got a mineral sunscreen.  But this one isn't going to be for people with brown skin.  It goes on smoothly, and I'm confident it works.  But you are going to look terrible.  I put it on my arm.  It looks iridescent and chalky white at the same time.  It dries down to grey.  No, it doesn't fade LOL.  So if you want to look like a human being, that isn't sickly, dont use this on your face.  And if you have brown skin, unfortunately this isn't the solution.  I have tinted sunscreens - colorescience, but I really feel like those are makeup and it will rub off on clothes.  Its unfortunate, but I'll keep looking.  I'll give these away to people that don't mind the white cast.
In order to get the amount of sun protection stated on the bottle, I would need Quite a bit of product. Usually in my routine I apply sunscreen in a few layers with each layer being about a pea sized amount I spread across my face and neck. This product left a white cast like no other sunscreen I’ve used before. I understand zinc oxide leaves more white cast than other types of sunscreen but this was very excessive. Not only that it was difficult to spread across my face. I love CeraVe and have used other products of theirs within my skincare routine and have to say I typically LOVE their products. This one is a pass for me. I’ll be saving it for days I am home working in the yard and can tolerate such a dense, white casted formula.
I love that this product is not chemical sunscreen, which causes breakout on my skin, and contains simple, great quality ingredients. BUT, it does leave a white cast. It is so thick that my skin hardly absorbs it and it piles & flakes on my skin. It also dries my skin  A LOT. Overall, I am disappointed. There are better products in the market for this price.
This face sun protection cream is falsely advertised. First of all, the expiration date is in 3 months. Second of all, I applied it to my skin complexion and it’s not for my skin type,  it turned my skin white, my goal was not to get a whitening lotion, if not, a sun protection. This sun protection cream is for Caucasia not for dark or tan skin complexion unless your goal is to get a skin whitening.
While yes, it is more of a challenge to absorb into skin to minimize the white, my focus is on a quality sunscreen vs aesthetics when I am taking my daily walk. I am more than a bit of a sun phobe - and I am pleased with how it protects.
This truly is a fantastic zinc sunscreen. I do not find it drying at all but then again I have oily skin. It does have a whitish cast to it, however, I wear a tinted moisturizer over it so that is not a problem. This is a fantastic sunscreen I highly recommend it.
I dont know what it is, but this sunscreen leaves my face white, white. And im a caramel tone. I had to go buy a different one. But with how it changed the color on me, im guessing it is excellent protection.  :]🤣
Always have loved CeraVe products. No need to spend a bunch of money when you can use this stuff that works just as well if not better.
Works pretty well for a sensitive skin. However, it leaves white film on skin and doesn’t want to go away even if you rub it harder. Its thick and leaves mark on wherever you touch with it.
if helped me NOT to sun burni love All Cerave products!
Made me look a little pale  but great stuff
It’s one of the best sunscreens I’ve used. Definitely recommend
Great sunscreen! but make sure to use a little bit! Is way heavy for the face I think! but great value!
This product will make your face look so unnaturally white.  It is greasy and hard to take off.
i bought this because purito's unscented sunscreen was out of stock. protects from sun well enough from what i can tell, but white casts me really badly - very difficult to rub in fully, especially if you have facial hair. you'll be walking around with sun screen on your face all day
If you’re more of a dark skin tone this sunscreen is not for you. It leaves such a horrible white cast you end up looking like a ghost.It’s not hydrating and hard to rub in. I would recommend the Neutrogena sport face oil free sunscreen instead .
I don’t know why you’d have to apply every 2 hours when you’re wearing makeup haha
Don’t buy it unless you want to have a white mask on your face or look like Mark Zuckerberg :)))
This protects from the sun very well but the white cast is really bad.
Great for face!
Great product great price great delivery
This sunscreen is really good! It leaves my skin feeling soft, but also doesn’t leave a white cast! It is not oily at all, and doesn’t make me look pale. Highly recommend!
Too dry
Doesn't work for medium shade
me agrada
I love CeraVe but I have to say this product is not it I am on the very pale side and even on me the white cast is extremely evident there's absolutely no way I would ever wear this in public unless possibly with the tinted sunscreen on top even then I feel like it would look terrible is not hydrating whatsoever it's super dry feeling it feels nothing like the tinted version which I actually found to be pretty okay even though my hands this is terrible absolutely no for any skin tone sorry CeraVe please reformulate
It had great protection, I wish it was water resistant. It does leave a white cast that doesn’t really go away. I don’t mind as long as it protects me but it might be important for some.I recommend this, will get the tinted one to try as well
it is good for use.
Great sun protection. It’s thick and difficult to spread. You will look like a mime.  I use it because has everything I want from a sunscreen. I also use retinal at night.  Meaning, that a mineral sunscreen does provide good protection. The only issue I have is the white cast.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
My dermatologist recommended I use sunscreen made for the face and sunscreen body lotion. I purchased this face sunscreen and I love it. My skin absorbed it nicely and it wasn’t greasy. Good price and I highly recommend this product.
I like that a little goes a long way ...it's just a little to thick for my preference.
This sunscreen is horrible. Leaves a horrible white cast and feels chalky. Also dries up in patches.
I usually love CeraVe products, this sunscreen disappointed me. While the sunscreen provides UV protection, it left me looking like a ghost. It is very thick and does not rub in easily. I had to use only a little dot and then I’m left wondering if my face was properly protected from the sun. I got a sample sunscreen from a dermatologist that I absolutely love. It is much thinner, not oily, doesn’t leave me looking like a ghost, and provides great protection.
Nice product
Makes wherever you put it on, pale as heck, its legitimate sunscreen, so be weary
I can't put the amount of sunscreen that I want because it leaves a very noticeable white cast. It's not that easy to spread.
It's awful make my skin so dry and i look like a ghost when i put a little bit of it , I'm so angry about this purchase i will never buy it again ..
I was really looking forward to this sunscreen. It came very fast (next day after I ordered), but when I checked the expiration date it said 11/20 meaning I have about a month and a half to use it before it expires. That sucks! Should I return it and ask for a new bottle? I tried a little of it to see if I’d like it and how it would look on my face. It does leave a white cast on my face initially, but after I gave it some time to settle it wasn’t too bad I guess. I like that it’s very light weight and moisturizing and has no fragrance to it. I’m just a little upset that my product expires so soon...I don’t even get half a year to try to use it all up.
Makes my face white and very hard to rub in
Best sunblock for face!! Light, goes on easy and smooth. Not sticky and absorbs quickly!!!
I was hoping for this sunblock to be light weight but it’s far from it. It’s pretty heavy and smoothing it on the face is far from smooth. It also leaves a white residue. My face was whitish after I applied this and due to its heaviness it settled in every pore! It’s not that great of a moisturiser either.Definitely not what I wanted. Could be ok for the body but not face.
To protect from the Sun burning
I did not like it leaves white cast
I like Cera Ve products as it was recommended by my dermatologist and it does do it s job of sunscreen well.It is a moist product that spreads quite well on the skin for coverage.
Satisfied
I was expecting this to be good because I like other Cerave products and it was so expensive for such a small tube. Wrong.It stays white, making you look like a ghost, and does not blend into the skin at all. It feels like smearing Elmer's glue onto your skin. My face began cracking after a few hours of wearing it and it sunk into fine lines on the face that are normally unnoticeable and aged me 10 years.So if you want to look like a crusty, wrinkly, pale freak that smeared glue all over their face I guess you should use this product.
I like how easy it is to use, great coverage, great sunscreen!
Wirked
Maybe Great for beach but not so for daily wear. Leaves alot of white.!
Doesn't spread easy, leaves a terrible white cast on my olive skin that won't go away. Couldn't use even once, returned it.
It has a creazy white cast that doesnt go away!
Great
It's not as thick (and impossible to apply) as the Neutrogena, but doesn't go on smoothly, leaves an ugly blotchy white film when it dries. Pretty much the only thing going for it is the price.  I tossed my tube and have moved to TiZo "Ultra Zinc" and "AM Replenish." Both are vasty more expensive and vastly better than this stuff.
Protected, no smell and went on smoothly!Very happy!
I was so excited for this. I tried it alone. Mixed with makeup primer. Mixed with moisturizer and it never blended out.
This does a great job at protecting from the sun, however, this is thick. It goes on like zinc paste “lite.” Very hard to blend into skin and leaves a visible coat of white on my face. Other than that, it isn’t greasy at all and it seems to do a great job protecting from the sun. I would opt for the 30 spf or lighter in the future though.
No matter what you do you come out looking like a clown with white face .. you can apply a tiny bit and rub all you want and you look like a clown
Easy to apply, not greasy and gentle on my sensitive skin.
I love CeraVe products. This is one of the best sunscreens I’ve used!
1. REEKS of chemicals, like a can of cheap latex house paint.2. Spreads unevenly and leaves a noticable white cast (and I'm light skinned).3. It broke my face out  - not pimples, not red - but an all-over, visible bumpy rash.I do not recommended this product.
I like cerave products but not this one. It leaves a white film and is heavy
It gives a lot of white cast
I did not dislike anything. I like the protection I get from using this product and it is definitely easy to spread. Cera ve is consistently a top choice for me.
It’s so white and thick. I have a light skin but it was terrible.
Price!
Doesn’t absorb well and leaves a white film after application.
This smooths on easily and provides good protection, but it is White.  It looks fine when used as a base for your regular makeup. If you have dark skin, it could be hard to cover.  And best of all - No breakouts.  And I have sensitive skin.
Leave a white cast, not recommended from aesthetic view
I have super sensitive skin, dermatitis, & love this product.  For the people who wrote bad reviews, & having used zinc oxide for years, you have to know how toy spread it on.  It takes very little, just a little on your finger, & you spread it all over, including your forehead.  If you get too much, the zinc oxide will turn your skin white.  That is the sun protector.  Just use sparingly.
I have been using this sunbolcker. i like minerl sunscreen because it suits my sensitive skin. Not only it protects my skin also makes my skin more brightening and healthier. (My skin is light tan it works very good on me)
But thick and hard to spread w/o first mixing it w/ a substantial makeup.
Instead of absorbing it dries into a light and flakey crusty sheet that will prevent sunburn and any women from talking to you.
This sunscreen came in a tiny deodorant type applicator, perfect to throw in a bag. It melts into the skin perfectly and protected me well.
This product leaves your face like a ghost. It doesn’t blend well in the skin. Not the results I was expecting.
good product but is a little greasy
I like it.
terrible white cast. horrible, I look like I dumped my whole face in whip cream like ms.doubtfire
Need to rub in a bit to get rid of whiteness.
Love love the sunscreen...not sticky or clumpy at all. Easily blend in after application. Would be back for more!!
See original
I love this coz I know I’m totally protected, but makes me look like a ghost, so be careful about the quantity
The item came today, usually, with suncream I bought it came with a seal and there was none.Rovectin which I bought was 50ml and it was full there (3 weeks ago)with size comparison with Cerave 75mlThe bottom of the bottle was flat - how it is 50% more than Roventic which I have already used?It is greasy compare to Roventic, totally
Love the texture and ingredient list. I wish I could use it but it leaves so much white cast on my skin and just won’t go away no matter how long I try smoothing it off. It’s not water-resistant so I can’t really use on body either with sweat and all. Regretfully gave it to a friend.
Horrible white cast! Please don’t buy it. It’s only meant for Caucasian skin, not for Asian or tanner skin tone. I bought cetaphil sheer mineral liquid sunscreen. And that’s the best I could find with SPF50 (Have tried nutrogena, cereve). And find it’s got negligible white cast.
I am Asian and application of the sunscreen makes me look very ghostly with heavy white cast. I stopped using it.
Received the product without any seal on the box and no seal on the bottle itself. This is not typical of any American product. How can I confirm that the product is authentic or that the volume is correct? I did a dip-stick check and found the tube to be filled only up to the 2/3 level. Don't know what to do about this!
Love it.

I use the CeraVe sunscreen stick on a daily basis. In fact, I usually don’t leave the house without it. It has helped so much with sun protection over the past few months and I’ve come to love it!
This product is okay but I’m in the market for something new. It leaves a small white residue i@wish it wouldn’t
This is honestly great for traveling and for any outdoor activity! Perfect size to carry around with you very portable and stays for longer then half a day. Very light weight
I love this product. Especially in the summer my skin gets burnt easily. This is my go too sunscreen when I don’t wanna burn. It was fairly affordable and it works like a charm. I would recommend to anyone who has the same problem as me
I like this product and I would say it’s kind of good but I would prefer the nonstick because it’s easier for me to use
I feel like there is no way for this to stay clean if you use it directly on the skin so that’s why it’s not 5 stars.
i like using this product because it is pretty affordable. it also has a great design and can upgrade your skincare game to a new level. very easy to use. would buy again for sure!!!! great quality product. i would definitely recommend to anyone!!!!!
This suncream stick is amazing !!! I can't believe how it changed the way i look at this SOF products, Putting on sunscreen everyday is very important and This product helped me for 100000000000000% I would like to recommend it to all of people around the world
I like this product because I love CeraVe! Definitely a good product since I usually only use subscription on my face. I would definitely recommend this product to people for more than just the summertime!
This is so important when it comes to getting the right skin care at home! Only pro on this one it’s amazing it’s a long lasting natural and very affordable and effective leaving your skin smelling wonderful leaving it soft and vibrant and looking amazing of course. Highly highly recommended! luxury at its finest! Must for sun care that works!!
CeraVe is the best skincare I’ve used so far. It’s a little on the pricey side, but the stick is light and non greasy. I have no improvements as it comes in a variety of consistencies to suit different application preferences.
￼i use this and will continue to use it but i have to say it’s kinda difficult to rub in but it’s very easy to use on the go i would say and it’s a pretty reasonable price probably wouldn’t recommend again but it’s pretty ok
My sister uses this before she puts on her makeup. Sunscreen is really important and it is easy to apply.
Definitely good for applying and re applying. Rubs in great and doesn’t leave a white cast. Definitely gets sandy if you bring to the beach but other than that there are no issues with this products. Very affordable for the clean ingredients
Love the sunscreen. I use is most of the time. It melts to ur skin. Doesn’t have white stuff.
This product is always in my beach bag. It is so easy to apply to the face since it is a stick. It's also super easy to apply on kids to and avoids the fear of getting sunscreen in their eyes. I have not found one thing from CeraVe that I am not in love with!
best sunscreen and very easy to use. i love this sunscreen, very cons. easy to apply, lightweight, and zero white cast. very affordable for how well it works. i would definitely recommend.
"
Cerave is the only brand I trust for sunscreen. I break out so easily and these other brands make my skin awful."
I recently started incorporating sunscreen into my skincare routine as i realized how important it is! After trying out different sunscreens this one was perfect!! Not too sticky and blends in without a weird smell or after cast
Honestly 5 out of 5. This is like magic it really cleans and makes your skin look better after a week. I have no words you definitely need to give this a try
I only use cerave on my skin because it has high reviews! It makes my skin become more clear and healthy! I really recommend if you need new skin care.
I love this sunscreen. It is very gentile and I highly recommend this product. I found this brand from TikTok and I’m obsessed
Goes well on and has great protection. Definitely only for your face and will need to be rubbed in after applying. Compact and easily portable.
It is soft and silky when it is put on your face. It is very much gentle and it isn’t rough on the face. It makes your face feel soft and it is nice packaging and easy to open. It’s already so improved it doesn’t need improvement.
I really love this product I give it 11 out of 10. Everyone needs this mineral sunscreen stick it really works good for the sun or just apply before your make up I recommend this to everybody ! It needs to be sold more often ￼
I absolutely loved this it’s in the form of a deodorant so easy to apply I hate to apply￼ sunscreen but this is so easy I apply every two hours I definitely recommend the best purchases.￼￼￼￼
This is my favorite sunscreen of all times. It is a little oily but it leaves such a nice dewy finish. You can even apply this over makeup without it smearing! Everyone with normal to dry skin should give this a try
I love CeraVe products and this does not disappoint! Applies well, does not irritate or dry my sensitive skin, and has helped make my skin look overall healthier! Yes, I would recommend these products!
I love the sunscreen I love these on my face it keeps my face nice and covered with the sunscreen so it keeps it nice and protected￼
I’ve been looking for affordable tinted sunscreen and I found this baby! this product it’s incredible. I love using this, it’s like bb cream. I highly recommend this if your working wholeday and wearing a mask. It gives you glow and at the same time protection. LOVE THIS TINTED SUNSCREEN SO MUCH.
Great ingredients! SO important to use quality products without all the junk. You will get that with this sunscreen.
Great for sensitive skin. Provide great coverage and stays put and doesn’t get into your eyes. It's an nice sunscreen!!
I am a huge fan of Cerave Skincare! It has truly worked wonders on my skin! Using most of the line from serums to wash to moisturizer to sunscreen has improved the texture and look of my skin so much the past few months! Highly reccomend Cerave products to all!
I love the sunscreen I use it mostly for the summer because that’s what it’s used for and when you go to the beach￼
This is another product i love especially when i’m out of the house and under the sun. Very easy to use. Of course it works because it’s CeraVe!
I recommend this sunscreen because it is more gentle than chemical sunscreen..also this is my opinion but I recommend this!!
I love you stick of sunscreen so much it is so easy to put on and it’s great for keeping the sun burns away it’s so easy to apply and just feels really great smells so good and I would definitely recommend it’s great for toddlers who don’t really like putting on sunscreen because they can do it on their own because it’s on a stick love it so much￼
I Love Everything About It . This Sunscreen Doesn’t Leave That White Film On Your Face . It Moisturizes Into The Skin Very Well !
It provides excellent coverage and stays on, not getting into your eyes and doesn't run because it's a stick. It's also great for sensitive skin. It's the perfect sunscreen.
Works great you don’t even need to put on makeup. It’s soft and keeps my skin clean and fresh. It also works great to keeping your skin healthy and not break out!
This goes on well and doesn’t feel too sticky. You can barely tell it’s on. I wear it underneath my makeup
Strong and long lasting. I used this for my kids at the beach and even in the water I don’t find myself having to reapply as much as others. It’s very effective and the only one I use for my family
I like this product Goes on nice you don’t hav to keep rubbing it in it’s very effective I would not improve this product at all it’s gentle enough for the family
I gave it a 4 because it sometimes leaves my face with a white tint. Other than that, it’s a great sunscreen and my face feels protected! I mix it with the moisturizing cream from Cerave and it does the job.
I really like this product because it does not leave my face white like others and it can be defined easily and it does not leave my skin dry, I highly recommend it for the summer.
Very convenient for travel use as it doesn’t take up much space in bags! Last through the hot sun and are very hydrating and protectant! I thought it was a perfect lightweight sunscreen and would definitely use again!
Easy application! Fits right into your purse so it makes it convent to bring anywhere you go!
I do like this sunscreen. I use it as a primer under my makeup or just alone on my t zone. It’s basic but good for the price. I’ll continue to repurchase plus it’s spf 50! I also like that’s it mineral I don’t break out as much.
Terrible white cast and it’s super heavy! Find the 30 SPF if possible! If you are a person of color like me the white cast is BAD!
This brand is always really great with sensitive skin. I really love the lightweight quality of the stick-- very easy for travel and application. I think it's a good value. It doesn't have a scent so I don't smell like the poolwhen I'm going to work. Highly recommended.
This stuff is pretty good, I use the version that's in a lotion form. It does the trick, but always makes my face feel oily for some reason. Maybe it's not good for my skin type! I have normal skin but it's prone to get oily in certain situations.
I am a fan of this brand. I use a lot of their products like their sunscreen and face cleanser and eye cream. This sunscreen not only is good for your skin because of the minerals it has inside but it will protect you from the sun all day long￼
Don’t get me wrong, I love Cerave products. I had heard great things about this sunscreen and I decided to purchase it but I noticed I guess it’s a new version. I did not like it. It’s just not of my liking
I’ve been using this for about a month which has been going great. It was recommended by my dermatologist

It provides excellent coverage and stays on, not getting into your eyes and doesn't run because it's a stick. It's also great for sensitive skin. It's the perfect sunscreen.
Works great you don’t even need to put on makeup. It’s soft and keeps my skin clean and fresh. It also works great to keeping your skin healthy and not break out!
This goes on well and doesn’t feel too sticky. You can barely tell it’s on. I wear it underneath my makeup
Strong and long lasting. I used this for my kids at the beach and even in the water I don’t find myself having to reapply as much as others. It’s very effective and the only one I use for my family
I like this product Goes on nice you don’t hav to keep rubbing it in it’s very effective I would not improve this product at all it’s gentle enough for the family
I gave it a 4 because it sometimes leaves my face with a white tint. Other than that, it’s a great sunscreen and my face feels protected! I mix it with the moisturizing cream from Cerave and it does the job.
I really like this product because it does not leave my face white like others and it can be defined easily and it does not leave my skin dry, I highly recommend it for the summer.
Very convenient for travel use as it doesn’t take up much space in bags! Last through the hot sun and are very hydrating and protectant! I thought it was a perfect lightweight sunscreen and would definitely use again!
Easy application! Fits right into your purse so it makes it convent to bring anywhere you go!
I do like this sunscreen. I use it as a primer under my makeup or just alone on my t zone. It’s basic but good for the price. I’ll continue to repurchase plus it’s spf 50! I also like that’s it mineral I don’t break out as much.
Terrible white cast and it’s super heavy! Find the 30 SPF if possible! If you are a person of color like me the white cast is BAD!
This brand is always really great with sensitive skin. I really love the lightweight quality of the stick-- very easy for travel and application. I think it's a good value. It doesn't have a scent so I don't smell like the poolwhen I'm going to work. Highly recommended.
This stuff is pretty good, I use the version that's in a lotion form. It does the trick, but always makes my face feel oily for some reason. Maybe it's not good for my skin type! I have normal skin but it's prone to get oily in certain situations.
I am a fan of this brand. I use a lot of their products like their sunscreen and face cleanser and eye cream. This sunscreen not only is good for your skin because of the minerals it has inside but it will protect you from the sun all day long￼
Don’t get me wrong, I love Cerave products. I had heard great things about this sunscreen and I decided to purchase it but I noticed I guess it’s a new version. I did not like it. It’s just not of my liking
I’ve been using this for about a month which has been going great. It was recommended by my dermatologist

I’ve been looking for affordable tinted sunscreen and I found this baby! this product it’s incredible. I love using this, it’s like bb cream. I highly recommend this if your working wholeday and wearing a mask. It gives you glow and at the same time protection. LOVE THIS TINTED SUNSCREEN SO MUCH.
Great ingredients! SO important to use quality products without all the junk. You will get that with this sunscreen.
Great for sensitive skin. Provide great coverage and stays put and doesn’t get into your eyes. It's an nice sunscreen!!
I am a huge fan of Cerave Skincare! It has truly worked wonders on my skin! Using most of the line from serums to wash to moisturizer to sunscreen has improved the texture and look of my skin so much the past few months! Highly reccomend Cerave products to all!
I love the sunscreen I use it mostly for the summer because that’s what it’s used for and when you go to the beach￼
This is another product i love especially when i’m out of the house and under the sun. Very easy to use. Of course it works because it’s CeraVe!
I recommend this sunscreen because it is more gentle than chemical sunscreen..also this is my opinion but I recommend this!!

I gave it a 4 because it sometimes leaves my face with a white tint. Other than that, it’s a great sunscreen and my face feels protected! I mix it with the moisturizing cream from Cerave and it does the job.
I really like this product because it does not leave my face white like others and it can be defined easily and it does not leave my skin dry, I highly recommend it for the summer.
Very convenient for travel use as it doesn’t take up much space in bags! Last through the hot sun and are very hydrating and protectant! I thought it was a perfect lightweight sunscreen and would definitely use again!
Easy application! Fits right into your purse so it makes it convent to bring anywhere you go!
I do like this sunscreen. I use it as a primer under my makeup or just alone on my t zone. It’s basic but good for the price. I’ll continue to repurchase plus it’s spf 50! I also like that’s it mineral I don’t break out as much.
Terrible white cast and it’s super heavy! Find the 30 SPF if possible! If you are a person of color like me the white cast is BAD!
This brand is always really great with sensitive skin. I really love the lightweight quality of the stick-- very easy for travel and application. I think it's a good value. It doesn't have a scent so I don't smell like the poolwhen I'm going to work. Highly recommended.
This stuff is pretty good, I use the version that's in a lotion form. It does the trick, but always makes my face feel oily for some reason. Maybe it's not good for my skin type! I have normal skin but it's prone to get oily in certain situations.
I am a fan of this brand. I use a lot of their products like their sunscreen and face cleanser and eye cream. This sunscreen not only is good for your skin because of the minerals it has inside but it will protect you from the sun all day long￼
Don’t get me wrong, I love Cerave products. I had heard great things about this sunscreen and I decided to purchase it but I noticed I guess it’s a new version. I did not like it. It’s just not of my liking
I’ve been using this for about a month which has been going great. It was recommended by my dermatologist
I’ve been looking for affordable tinted sunscreen and I found this baby! this product it’s incredible. I love using this, it’s like bb cream. I highly recommend this if your working wholeday and wearing a mask. It gives you glow and at the same time protection. LOVE THIS TINTED SUNSCREEN SO MUCH.
Great ingredients! SO important to use quality products without all the junk. You will get that with this sunscreen.
Great for sensitive skin. Provide great coverage and stays put and doesn’t get into your eyes. It's an nice sunscreen!!
I am a huge fan of Cerave Skincare! It has truly worked wonders on my skin! Using most of the line from serums to wash to moisturizer to sunscreen has improved the texture and look of my skin so much the past few months! Highly reccomend Cerave products to all!
I love the sunscreen I use it mostly for the summer because that’s what it’s used for and when you go to the beach￼
This is another product i love especially when i’m out of the house and under the sun. Very easy to use. Of course it works because it’s CeraVe!
I recommend this sunscreen because it is more gentle than chemical sunscreen..also this is my opinion but I recommend this!!
I love you stick of sunscreen so much it is so easy to put on and it’s great for keeping the sun burns away it’s so easy to apply and just feels really great smells so good and I would definitely recommend it’s great for toddlers who don’t really like putting on sunscreen because they can do it on their own because it’s on a stick love it so much￼
I Love Everything About It . This Sunscreen Doesn’t Leave That White Film On Your Face . It Moisturizes Into The Skin Very Well !
It provides excellent coverage and stays on, not getting into your eyes and doesn't run because it's a stick. It's also great for sensitive skin. It's the perfect sunscreen.
Works great you don’t even need to put on makeup. It’s soft and keeps my skin clean and fresh. It also works great to keeping your skin healthy and not break out!
This goes on well and doesn’t feel too sticky. You can barely tell it’s on. I wear it underneath my makeup
