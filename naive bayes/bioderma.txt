Nice sunscreen but pricey and makes face little shiny too
its good for dry skin
I like the high UVA protection that the suncream offers but it does give that whitecast, especially in the eyebrows and beard which looks quite bad. Also, sometimes it peels so bad that you regret applying it in the first place.
This sunscreen is extremly good at sun protection. The only thing which i doesnt liked was it leaves white patches on skin after applying
It has no scent so that's the best part actually product seems to be good but my skin just reacted little different and when informed the seller was kind enough to respond quick and resolve.
Superb.  Go for it
It’s a good product recommended by my dermat, but needs to apply in intervals. Depends on skin type. Works perfect for combination skin.
Great packaging, Trusted and reliable technology for very high sun protection and this product is better in every aspect than the previous one, truly worth the extra 200INR, doesn't burn or sting in the eye for me, cream to fluid consistency, Provides one of the highest UVA Protection in the market.I hope they come out with bigger volume packaging, that would be perfect.
I bought this after lot of deliberation and I am glad I did. I have very very dry skin so the sun cream I bought in past were sticky and would give me a feeling of sweaty, which was not a great feeling. I used this (almost finished) and I wouldn't mind a little bit of fragrance but this has none which is okay. It gives white cast after one spread and if you keep evenly spreading the cream on the face the white cast is gone (in few circular motions).  All in all I found this cream amazing.
Satisfied
I am satisfied with bioderma SPF 50. It actually protects from harsh UV rays.
Good
Very greasy. Tends to break out . I had smooth skin. Lost d texture.
i have been using for 2 months nowexcellent stuff.
As if applied powder paste that will melt with just touch of water!!Wasted money.Submitted same on their official websites but no reply.
Very nice productdry touch texture is awesome
Definitely buying it again
It’s really good! Would be perfect if the price were cheaper or the size were bigger. My skin is sensitive. Wrong product will irritate it, cause acnes, or worse, make it darker. But this one feels so light, doesnt have any scent, and so far I dont have any problem using it. It doesnt leave much whitecast tooI am going to buy one more now since we’re going to beach soon.

I do recommend this sunscreen because it gives light and glossy finish to your skin.I think 50spf is suitable for indian skin.After applying this within few minutes sweat is on ,so tap with ur finger or with cotton fabric it will set quickly.This sunscreen will work great in winters
I purchased this sunprotection cream for my sister as she has very sensitive skin. This is a nice cream and has good texture n is light in weight. It has nicely suited my sisters skin type. It is more water base n less greasy.
I am very particular about sunscreens, because I have combinstin skin so I always prefer non-sticky sunscreen and trust me it is one of them and my skin is feeling fresh  and breathing otherwise I always need wipe it off.
I love all bioderma products as it suits my sensitive skin. This sunscreen is also great, provides good sun protection (spf 50+) and is water resistant too. Good product overall.
I am giving this review just after using the product only from a week and it was wonderful. It was absolutely ultra matt . Its spread is good as i took only 3 or 4 drop all over my face. It is completly perfect for all type of skin eother men can also use. Also i dnt feel sweat on face after applying it
Good for dry skin
Good product, will recommend it.
Very bad packaging and product looks like a copy of the origin. Doesn't look genuine.
Bioderma spf50 phptoderm max cream completely suits my skin, smells good, light on skin, non-greasy and perfectly absorbs im the skin. Perfect for all those who drives bikes like me Overall nice product
Best ever cream.. I used this. Totally satisfactory.. No chip chip no blackness. Fragrance is also have a soft scent I love this cream.
I love this sunscreen

"hello guys and welcome to my channel my"
"name is Jesper fussing and today we are"
"going to look at a sunscreen and we're"
"going to do at one of these those tinted"
"ones and what you would like to know is"
"how does it actually look color wise"
"so we're firstly the one we are talking"
"about today is the one from Bioderma and"
"it looks like this and the embellish"
"looks like this or the packaging looks"
"like this and first of all yes you would"
"like to know what is the SPF and that is"
"a 50 a plus on this one here and it says"
"that it has the UVA in a circle and"
"actually it was so difficult to see it I"
"couldn't really find it on the tube"
"itself but when I looked at the"
"packaging I could see that down here it"
"says that it has the UVA in a circle so"
"that means that it is at least a 1/3 UVA"
"compared to the UVB so compared to the"
"SPF now one other thing is that normally"
"I like to use well that's not quite true"
"because the one I use does not have any"
"star ratings on it and that is the one"
"from La Roche Posay dia on tinted"
"version but it is a good idea if you can"
"find something with this star rating on"
"it and if you have at least a 4 to 5"
"stars and that is something I would use"
"if I went to the beach or if I knew I"
"had to be out in the Sun for a long time"
"but just for daily use I use the one"
"from La Roche Posay which is with a UV"
"in a circle but it doesn't have any a"
"star rating now this one here has the UV"
"inner circle but I know star rating so"
"we can't really talk about that and what"
"you would like to know is how is the"
"color well if you look at how are they"
"making the colours in this sort of"
"products then when they have attended"
"version and the LA roche-posay us that"
"had a has a tinted version and the"
"Bioderma has a tinted aversion and other"
"companies has tinted versions as well"
"but for those three that i mentioned"
"they are using"
"something called iron oxides and they"
"are using a yellow oxide a red and a"
"black oxide and then they are using it"
"to tenem oxide as well the titanium"
"oxide is what will give you the sun"
"protection or what would be the sun"
"screen itself but this one here has a"
"chemical filters in it as well as the"
"event one is a purely a mineral"
"sunscreen so why do I mention the"
"titanium oxide well I do that because it"
"is very white and that is obviously"
"something that they are also using in"
"order to lighten the color of a product"
"so it's not so dark also it comes up to"
"the color that they wanted because when"
"I just said so is not so dark well the"
"whole thing about these tinted"
"moisturizers hood tinted sunscreen as"
"these ones are is that it it's almost"
"sort of like one color is supposed to"
"fit all and I think we all know that one"
"color certainly does not fit all"
"so for sunscreens that I attended it"
"should be just like for makeup so for"
"foundations and a lot of companies are"
"really good at that now and some"
"companies are not that good and I would"
"say that if you are still making a"
"sunscreen which is a one color fits or"
"maybe you have not really understood the"
"message so we are reviewing this one"
"anyway so what I would say about the"
"iron oxide is that the difference is"
"that in this one here and the one from"
"even then the first ingredients of the"
"oxides so as they are listed in the"
"ingredients list is the yellow oxide and"
"that means yellow iron oxide and that"
"means of course that that product is a"
"little bit more oranjee whereas the one"
"from the hospice aid that is so that the"
"red iron oxide is listed first so there"
"is more red iron oxide in the one from a"
"large person and there are in the ones"
"from oven and from a higher term"
"and that you can already think gives a"
"sort of a difference in how the color is"
"is more red or is it more orange II and"
"then they also have a black iron oxide"
"in it in order to make it more well"
"darker so it is obviously the mix about"
"for those iron oxide that are making up"
"at a color so kind of like if you are"
"looking at a product you can read from"
"an ingredients list if they have the"
"yellow iron oxide listed above the red"
"iron oxide then it is more to the orange"
"side and vice versa it would be more red"
"and I would say that the brown from LA"
"roche-posay is a it is red it is not"
"orange II I would say it it comes across"
"as being too red so yes should we try"
"this one here and as I always say just"
"take something out and this one you can"
"sign it's a big liquidy so it's not"
"kinda like super fatty it's more like"
"liquidy and I think they are actually"
"saying that it is now it says in French"
"maybe it says an image and it says aqua"
"fluid tante tres odor protection"
"protection is it Spanish as French I"
"don't really do French I just try my"
"best but it tended aqua fluid very high"
"air protection that's the English"
"version for you that so sell it our bio"
"protection I mean what you like to know"
"is the color so let's have a look so you"
"can just see it is kind of like really"
"liquidy so kinda like Crips out of there"
"this one here and it really looks like"
"well something it looks like a makeup"
"cream very good makeup cream and it"
"maybe if you can see the color compared"
"to my skin my skin is definitely not a"
"tent at the moment because I am"
"basically staying indoors due to the"
"situation that we are all in so I don't"
"have that much Sun and also means that I"
"actually not used a sunscreen for a long"
"time because I am basically indoors"
"every day so how does it look it's very"
"very liquid is very easy to distribute"
"so it has this sort of a column but what"
"our lightest show is that a lot of"
"people they are using so little"
"sunscreen so where this one here has the"
"same weight as the one from the wash per"
"se and when I use the one from the"
"hospice a I know I need to use half a"
"teaspoon of the teaspoons that I have"
"your teaspoon might look a different"
"might be small that might be bigger so I"
"just have measured and you can see a"
"video about that up there I will link to"
"that one how to find out how much"
"sunscreen to actually use so that for me"
"would be kind of like half a of these"
"teaspoons here so now you can maybe"
"already see that them if I maybe can"
"tilt it is very liquid about trying it a"
"little bit you can maybe see how it"
"looks how much it is and that is for my"
"entire face and when I put it into my"
"hand I have to remember that a lot of"
"the cream will stick in my hand so"
"basically it is better just to dip my"
"finger in and then go along and then do"
"it like that"
"now I'm only doing one side I only have"
"to use half of the amount but you can"
"already see it gives kind of a big"
"splash so this will just go on here and"
"you can see that it will definitely"
"change the color of my face so you will"
"see that this side by its on and this I"
"don't have anything on today I only have"
"a summer setting powder on I don't have"
"any foundation on or something like that"
"so it is just sitting about a little bit"
"of a highlight not to look at too tall"
"on camera so this is a kind of like how"
"it will look and yes I can smear it out"
"and smeared out and smeared and continue"
"to smear it out and a lot of it will be"
"taken up by my hands but that was not"
"the point the point was that I need to"
"leave it on the skin because it"
"is there for a certain purpose and that"
"is in order to protect me from the Sun"
"so when as you can see this is rather a"
"lot of stuff to put on and just put it"
"on my forehead so it is I mean one thing"
"to say is that it is very easy to"
"distribute it really easy to distribute"
"it's very liquidy and so on I don't we"
"don't want Maya to put this so I put it"
"there so don't want to have it all over"
"the place but yeah how do I think the"
"color is when I see it directly and not"
"through the camera where I know that the"
"color would be a little bit different"
"but I would say it definitely is not as"
"orangie or it's not as red as the LA"
"roche-posay one so and it's not as when"
"I spoke about the event mineral one I"
"compared it to a chocolate ice cream"
"that I had as a child and which was kind"
"of like um can I get grayish undertone"
"into the brown where I would definitely"
"not say that"
"this is like that so I would say this is"
"maybe color wise if you can maybe still"
"see it this is kind of like I'm"
"something in-between the one from our"
"then and the one from LA roche-posay but"
"um yeah I mean the other thing to"
"remember about these things here is that"
"they will actually act a little bit like"
"a foundation and when you are putting"
"foundation on you will use a setting"
"spray or you can use a setting powder"
"afterwards and I would say that that is"
"exactly the same that you need to do"
"when using something like this because"
"what happens is that I had it on my face"
"for several hours at the other day and"
"what very quickly happened was that it"
"started to run into the crease lines"
"around lines you get around the nose"
"when you're moving your face so it very"
"quickly went in there and I mean on"
"camera it would have looked nice but in"
"reality when people looked up close they"
"would be able to see that it all seeped"
"into all the"
"lines in one's face all the Mickey lines"
"that you get did it I know in my eyes"
"well not to begin with it took a little"
"while I would say it took maybe a couple"
"of hours and I did actually put it on"
"very liberal on my eyelids and it did as"
"in other lines on the face in the"
"creased line on the eyelid it it very"
"soon just ended up being a read a line"
"as their so yes again that you wouldn't"
"have needed to use some sort of a"
"setting powder in order to keep it a"
"fixed so we didn't or my eyes yes it did"
"annoy my eyes after a couple of hours"
"and I felt I just needed to take it away"
"and in order I thought maybe it's just"
"because my eyes are limpid dry or"
"whatever but then as soon as I took it"
"off and it was in the evening when I"
"took it off so it was not like okay it"
"has been a long day"
"my eyes are tired and so on because as"
"soon as I took it off and I don't"
"normally have it like that when I don't"
"have a sunscreen so I immediately I took"
"it off and I didn't have that annoying"
"feeling any longer"
"so clearly it was the sunscreen that"
"annoyed my eyes and I would say with the"
"LA roche-posay one I used the untainted"
"one and it has never annoyed my eyes and"
"they do say that I'd use some sort of a"
"anti i sting technology and I'm not"
"saying that that works really well and I"
"wouldn't say it does not leave any sort"
"of a cast on the face so if you would"
"like to have a sunscreen that doesn't"
"leave a cast on your face I would say"
"that the amount from a large per se is a"
"really good choice for many reasons and"
"this stuff here I will say that it's not"
"as bad as the event one which started to"
"really like burn around my eyes on the"
"eyelids around this very the eyes the"
"the area underneath my eye it started to"
"warm and get the sort of burning"
"sensation that just became worse and"
"worse and worse I did not have it with"
"this one here to the same degree as I"
"had with the event one of us just like a"
"little"
"it but it it wasn't that much I know my"
"eyes it was more like receiving into my"
"eyes and annoyed the eye itself so yes"
"this is how it looks and is it something"
"I will use no it is not and it feels"
"another thing to say is that it feels"
"crazy it's easy to distribute on your"
"face but it just has this drawback that"
"it's it's it's really crazy and it keeps"
"being greasy and there when I looked in"
"the mirror when I was outside it really"
"did shine to high heaven so it really"
"looked really glossy so yes this is not"
"something I can recommend but if you"
"can't help yourself but wanting to try"
"it try it out see how the color works"
"and let me know it works for you if you"
"would like to see more the sort of"
"videos please subscribe in Tibetan to"
"all those things to know to be notified"
"when I put more disabilities thank you"
"for watching see you bye"
"hi I'm Melina cop the pimple calm and"
"today I want to talk to you about"
"once again my favorite brand that"
"doesn't pay me for these videos yes I'm"
"not sponsored by this friend but I love"
"them so much that I will shout my love"
"for them from the rooftops every day I"
"mean seriously I have converted so many"
"people onto this brand that it's not"
"even funny"
"today I'm talking about bio derma and"
"specifically since you know I am like"
"the biggest a sunscreen fan ever like as"
"in I intend to look 19 for the rest of"
"my life the reason that I can look 19"
"for the rest of my life like the one"
"thing that allows me to do that is"
"sunscreen and so today I'm going to be"
"talking about the Bioderma"
"photo derm range of sunscreens so"
"Bioderma has many different ranges they"
"have ranges for sensitive skin the sense"
"of bio range they have ranges for"
"dehydrated skin and the Hydra bio range"
"they have a range for acne prone skin"
"the sebum range and they have the photo"
"derm range it's the orange one this"
"range is amazing because it's sunscreen"
"and the thing that I love about Bioderma"
"they provide broad-spectrum protection"
"and they are often you know fragrance"
"free and water resistance and these are"
"things that you want to look for in a"
"sunscreen in order to get adequate"
"protection it's really really important"
"that you wear your sunscreen"
"you should watch my sunscreen video to"
"learn more about you know the difference"
"between chemical and mineral sunscreens"
"and all the rest of it basically there"
"is no better one as long as you wear"
"sunscreen that's good the best sunscreen"
"is the sunscreen that you actually put"
"on your face the best sunscreen is the"
"sunscreen that protects you but I mean"
"there are brands out there that are"
"terrible that don't actually live up to"
"their labels like Neutrogena so I do not"
"use brands in you know the typical"
"sunscreen aisle"
"in the like a big store like Walmart I"
"don't know I only used sunscreens from"
"two brands ok Bioderma or polish choice"
"that's it I am like very elitist with my"
"sunscreen it has to be the best the best"
"the best the best because as you know"
"many sunscreens clog your pores and for"
"me being you know skin health coach it"
"would kind of be a little weird if I was"
"using products that clogged my skin and"
"many sunscreens in like natural skincare"
"ranges contains so many different kinds"
"of oils that they I don't know how they"
"even protect the skin from the Sun given"
"that a lot of them have oils high up on"
"the ingredient list that you know oils"
"kind of attract the Sun as opposed to"
"repel the sun's on oil based sunscreen"
"and no idea how that works from a"
"chemical perspective but I know what it"
"does so on a poor level it clogs it"
"clogs it clogs your pores so I have all"
"of these sunscreens from Bioderma and"
"I'm gonna include the Hydra bio SPF 30"
"in this because it is a very very good"
"but if you want to hear about my review"
"on this and watch the Hydra bio range"
"video because this is an amazing a"
"little everyday sunscreen so ok let's"
"begin with me be the body sunscreen"
"because many of us forget that our body"
"actually tends under the clothes as well"
"especially you know in the summer when"
"the Sun is so bright and so high"
"especially depending on where you are in"
"the world you know you can really cause"
"some real damage and you don't want to"
"just protect your face your whole body"
"kind of matters you know and I think"
"it's very important to wear sun"
"protection liberally on your whole body"
"in the summer and I love this because"
"look how huge it is it is 400"
"milliliters of spray sunscreen so you"
"can kind of get to hard-to-reach places"
"by spraying it I warn you this nozzle is"
"very very strong this is SPF 50 photo"
"derm max but it depends on where you are"
"in the world because I believe in Canada"
"they only have SPF 40 in this size and"
"in this product so Bioderma"
"is available literally all around the"
"world that's what I love about them"
"that's why I choose by odor mites I"
"pretty much can find it in any pharmacy"
"around of the world so I love how"
"accessible it is and I love how well"
"formulated the products are and I love"
"that they're broad-spectrum protection"
"so you get UVA protection as well this"
"one it does have an invisible texture"
"even though it comes out white and it"
"spreads very easily so I really like it"
"but my favorite thing is like how big it"
"is"
"well how much sunscreen I get Bioderma"
"products are really well priced for what"
"they are for another one that covers the"
"body but can also work on the face this"
"is the photo derm sensitive SPF 50 this"
"is literally probably the highest"
"protection you can get because it has"
"very high UVA protection"
"it's almost as high as the UVB"
"protection here and what I love about"
"Bioderma sunscreens is that they often"
"will put the actual UVA rating as well"
"as the UVB rating but they only do this"
"in Europe keep that in mind because the"
"rating system hasn't been universally"
"agreed upon yet around the world so like"
"Asia has their own rating system europe"
"has their own rating system the US"
"doesn't have a rating system the FDA is"
"trying to figure that out now but Europe"
"is more stringent on ingredients there"
"really like on top of their I really"
"like that they actually you know do a"
"rating system and it kind of allows you"
"to know like this sunscreens has better"
"broad-spectrum protection then this"
"sunscreen you know the rating system"
"does help because some sunscreens have"
"like a UVA rating of you know 20 some 30"
"some 40 and so I choose the highest"
"possible UVA protection because UVA rays"
"are the ones that are going to jack up"
"your collagen make your pores weak and"
"saggy and more prone to acne so I'm like"
"you no no no no thank you no thank you"
"this is a thicker product its extreme"
"milk very high protection photosensitive"
"skin water resistance and without"
"fragrance and it's without parabens for"
"those people who are afraid of paraben"
"all the bio dermis and"
"means our without parabens and you do"
"either without fragrance I believe as"
"well as far as I can see yep fragrance"
"for me very very good product this one"
"you can use on your body for like"
"extremely high protection this is for"
"those people who you know burn at the"
"slightest bit of the Sun amazing amazing"
"protection or like if you're out on the"
"beach where the highest protection"
"possible like do it you know and try"
"obviously to protect yourself like an"
"umbrella out some protective clothing"
"hats sunglasses so that you're not"
"burning your skin like it's just not a"
"good idea that tans are stupid"
"get some self-tanner get a fake tan"
"that's what I do take down and I've used"
"this on both the face and the body it's"
"thick on the face but still does an"
"amazing job this is something I would"
"wear if I'm literally out in the Sun"
"which is something I tried to avoid"
"doing but if like I'm at the beach and"
"this is the sunscreen I'll probably be"
"using on my face I also have this one"
"this is a photo Duramax SPF 100 I'm not"
"sure that this is even available in"
"North America because in North America I"
"believe that anything above an SPF 50 is"
"not sold and it's not that it's not sold"
"because it doesn't work or whatever it's"
"just that this is what happens with SPF"
"SPF 30 protects you from 97% of the race"
"so 3% still get in SPF 70 protects you"
"from 98% of the race so you know"
"anything above an SPF 50 is kind of"
"almost the same as an SPF 50 but when I"
"got this product I think I didn't see"
"anything else so I'm like I'm just"
"taking it and this is very high"
"protection for a sensitive skin and it's"
"a fluid texture so the texture is very"
"light but I do find it can ball up on"
"top of certain things so with some"
"screens you might find that if you use"
"like a silicone"
"product underneath things your sunscreen"
"might fall up and it's just a matter of"
"experimenting to find like the perfect"
"combination of products that work"
"together that don't make the sunscreen"
"fall up but what I do with this one in"
"particular is I wear it on my morning"
"I just simply washed my face and without"
"anything on my face on my dry face I"
"applied this sunscreen go for a run come"
"back wash it off and then do the rest of"
"my skincare routine I don't wear SPF 100"
"every single day but what I do do is I"
"wear do you do I wear SPF 30 every"
"single day a minimum of SPF 30 but I do"
"wear SPF 50 when I'm out kind of more"
"like out and about when I know I'll be"
"leaving the house I'm definitely wearing"
"SPF 50 if it's summer it's gonna be"
"definitely SPF 50"
"I do SPF 30 minimum let's say spring"
"winter you know when I don't see so much"
"Sun but in the summer spring on days"
"when I'm out SPF 50 is when I aim for it"
"because I want to get maximum protection"
"now speaking of SPF 50 this is what I"
"love about Bioderma they have awesome"
"SPF 50 these are both photo derm"
"obviously but one is a R and one is"
"laser"
"they're both creams and they're both"
"very high protection and they both have"
"high UVA ratings and all the stuff but"
"one of them is tinted the AR is tinted"
"so this one is tinted tinted dude these"

"texture they're not heavy at all AR is"
"tinted which I really really like it"
"doesn't have a white task on your skin"
"when you apply it because it's tinted"
"but it's not like tinted as in its gonna"
"cover all the imperfections maybe it"
"does so just very very subtly enough for"
"those really subtle no makeup days I"
"think it's awesome you can still wear"

"can't be too generous because you can"
"experience some filling"
"when you use too much of this so you"
"just use the amount that you need to get"
"even coverage to protect your whole face"

"good feedback on this particular"
"something that I'm talking about though"
"I would love to kind of compare the two"
"but this price point is better than the"
"Paula's Choice and the SPF once again is"
"higher so even if the polished choice"
"might be more cosmetically elegant"
"whatever this one is still better bang"
"for the buck SPF 50 SPF 50 in the summer"
"you know yeah I really love this product"
"but I've got the on tinted version"
"before I got the tinted version because"
"I didn't see the tinted version and so I"
"have both but I prefer the tinted one"
"even though they're both fantastic"
"products it's just you know the tinted"
"one you know it's just it's tinted so"
"there's no white cast on your skin I'm"
"not saying that they all have serious"
"white casts but again I'm a pale person"
"so that's something that you might want"
"to consider like if you have darker skin"
"they also this is the tent net you had"
"the natural color but they have a golden"
"color that's even darker than this one"
"so I would consider going for the darker"
"color so that you don't have to deal"
"with the white cast that some sometimes"
"sunscreens have the back white cast kind"
"of means that the sunscreen has some"
"good protection in there that's you know"

"genuine review and"
"we are starting on a clean slate so when"
"i'm done i just pat my face"
"and i do not grab my face as i always"

"i'll be going in with usually my morning"
"skin care routine you guys is"

"this sunscreen so it has been a month"
"since i've been using this for sunscreen"
"and i have a lot to say and this retails"
"for 275. i got it from a discount"
"and as you guys can see this is how it"
"looks this is how golden looks like what"
"kind of golden is the please make it"
"make sense"
"how is this golden color maybe you guys"
"i'm just tripping but anyways that is"
"how our golden color is looking"
"i don't know on which skin or maybe in"
"what skin"
"i have no idea guys but anyways we're"
"working with that color"
"and it's just like a sneak peek just to"
"show you guys anyways i just wanted to"
"show you that i'm dressed so"
"i'm not naked y'all this is how my face"
"is looking before i apply"
"the sunscreen now i'm gonna apply this"
"in three ways because i actually like"
"tried to work around the sunscreen"
"because already we can tell that"
"this is not gonna be matching my skin at"
"all so this is the normal way in which i"
"would apply my normal sunscreen that"
"doesn't"
"have any tint to it just to say guys"
"this is a chemical sunscreen so"
"it is not a mineral sunscreen sometimes"
"i would expect mineral sunscreens to"
"give us"
"white colors but anyways we're still in"
"um i don't know campaign to actually"
"bag companies to give us products that"
"are gonna match our skin"
"i don't know at all if it's in it's just"
"difficult to make something that is"
"going to match"
"our skin colors or just this chemical"
"filters"
"j they're just white or we can't have"
"any filters that are going to match our"
"face"
"i don't know you guys but anyways i work"
"that sunscreen into my skin and yeah it"
"is cool right anyways"
"let's blend it um golden color into your"
"skin baby your skin is golden your skin"
"is"
"gold so you need to match your skin so"
"anyways i waited for 15 minutes because"
"usually with my sunscreen"
"i'd like to apply 15 minutes before if"
"i'm not late you guys because sometimes"
"i tend to bleed but anyways"
"this is how we're looking on the sun wow"
"y'all this"
"is beautiful isn't it"
"so this is the second take so i figured"
"that that won't work so let me try to"
"apply this"
"on my palm rub it on my palm and apply"
"on my skin and see how this is going to"
"work and as you guys can see i'm just"
"using the same amount that"
"i normally use on my sunscreen that"
"doesn't give me any white cast and you"
"guys i"
"am not slapping myself way too hard i am"
"just trying to make sure that it is in"
"my skin like it's it's"
"it's just like penetrating into my skin"
"one thing i'll say you guys this product"
"doesn't go"
"it doesn't penetrate my skin real quick"
"and yeah if you've got sensitive skin"
"this will make you rub your skin because"
"you need to work it in as you guys can"
"see it it honestly looks a little bit"
"better"
"when i use that method of putting in i"
"then waited again for 15 minutes to see"
"if it will absorb to my skin"
"and i tried you guys it's not the best"
"but it did try so"
"when you put it in you rub it on your"
"palm and try to work it in it is a"
"little bit"
"better you do see a little bit of that"
"white cast but you just need to put a"
"little bit of work"
"i hate putting a lot of work more"
"especially in the morning we are late we"
"are busy okay"
"so i washed my face applied the"
"moisturizer and"
"the trick yeah this is the trick you"
"need to apply your moisturizer"
"and then real quick go in with that"
"bioderma sunscreen"
"and rub it on your palm and you are"
"going to work in layers if you work in"
"layers"
"you are not going to go wrong now the"
"problem is you are going to rub your"
"skin way more and it is not good for"
"those who have sensitive skin"
"i feel like it would work very well if"
"you've got them like fair"
"very fair skin because this will just"
"blend into your skin but you've got some"
"melanin if you're rich in melanin i"
"don't know you just need to"
"like make it work okay like you have to"
"work it in less as i'm doing here so i"
"work in layers and you know apply"
"another layer and"
"wait apply another layer and wait and"
"this was actually going in smoothly so"
"it doesn't work well when you apply a"
"lot at the same time"
"so you just need to make sure you"
"prepare yourself"
"early before you actually go out because"
"you're gonna need a lot of"
"layers and patting in and if your skin"
"becomes"
"too sensitive through rubbing then it's"
"a problem now i'm gonna give it to this"
"sunscreen"
"um it doesn't bend or stink it doesn't"
"even break me out at"
"all and it just it feels good on skin"
"it does give a little bit of"
"moisturizing effect and again if you've"
"got oily skin it tends to be oilier"
"um greasy sort of during the day so i"
"feel like it is also friendly for those"
"who have got"
"dry skin um i know if"
"you have like oily skin and sometimes"
"you need"
"like products that are not going to be"
"you know super oily so yeah take that"
"so these are the pros it's moisturizing"
"it doesn't give me any breakout"
"now um the cons you guys white casts"
"it doesn't really go in smoothly it just"
"takes time to absorb"
"[Music]"
"one thing that i'll also say you guys is"
"that this sunscreen doesn't really work"
"well"
"with other serums so you need to just"
"check"
"which serums your morning serums this"
"will"
"not roll more especially when you are"
"using the first and second method"
"it is going to roll so i find it work a"
"little bit better with"
"the moisturizer now that is it you guys"
"from me the golden lady and thank you so"
"much you guys for watching please don't"

"sunscreens i have yet to review i bought"
"pretty much the entire lineup of user"
"and sunscreens i also have a video"
"coming up soon featuring easton freezie"
"derm and heliocare so hit the"
"notification bell to know when those"
"videos go live as well so let's get into"
"the sunscreens i'll put a card up here"
"about some other videos where i feature"
"some other european sunscreens but i am"
"no stranger to these i've been using"
"these now for well over six months for"
"all let me see i use my handy little"
"quarter teaspoon to measure out the"
"quantity i do a full quarter teaspoon"
"generally for face ears and neck but for"
"the video since this is face application"
"i do half of this which is an eighth"
"teaspoon i'll work that in let it sit"
"for a few minutes so you can see the"
"final finish and the look of it on the"
"skin as well as if there's any white"
"cast so getting started first one we"
"have is from nivea this is their nivea"
"sun eevee face shine control this i"
"bought a long time ago and actually got"
"confused because i ended up buying two"
"of these because one of them on the box"
"just said shine control and the other on"
"the box said mattifying effect and i"
"thought they were separate things"
"they're not same thing this is from"
"nivea these cost six pounds they cost"
"costed they cost six pounds when i first"
"bought them although now they are eight"
"pound up boots but the magic of boots is"
"a lot of times they have sales this is"
"an spf 50 and it does have the uva"
"circled on it they do designate this as"
"high uva uvb protection on the back of"
"this it does have four star uva"
"protection in the bootstar system some"
"marketing details nivea sun uv face"
"shine control offers sun protection"
"specifically designed for facial needs"
"light formula offers long lasting and"
"instant mattifying effects you will note"
"that the cream absorbs excess oils from"
"your skin's surface and you'll be"
"protected from uv and high energy"
"visible lights which can cause premature"
"aging your skin will feel light"
"non-greasy non-sticky it is eye friendly"
"and ophthalmologically proven as well"
"worth noting compared to the other ones"
"in the video this one is not water"
"resistant formula details uv filter wise"
"stable benzone for uva octa satellite"
"for uvb tenosurp s broad spectrum"
"insulazole for more uvb and then even"
"lt150 for qb as well this does have"
"alcohol fragrance and essential oils in"
"there and so it's really interesting"
"when they're like oh it's sensitive skin"
"friendly but it does have those"
"components and also the eye irritancy"
"one is interesting as well because i"
"mean like how do you test that i know"
"how it's tested but realistically how"
"that's a very general statement to make"
"considering how subjective skin feel and"
"overall experience can be with something"
"like this does have a couple things like"
"tapioca starch and silica which aid in"
"some of the mattifying oil absorbing"
"benefits to it but then it also has this"
"specific licorice based extract and in"
"the marketing for it does say that this"
"does offer high energy visible light"
"protection this specific licorice"
"extract in this is the same exact one in"
"my holy grail eucerin sunscreen but"
"aside from that tocopherol acetate for"
"vitamin e antioxidant benefits and"
"that's kind of the extent of formulation"
"stand out my experience with this you"
"can see with the application the texture"
"for this is like a little bit creamy"
"it's got a little bit more body it's not"
"a true gel which i mean for the sake of"
"comparison the used saran that i talked"
"about that is one of my favorites very"
"gel texture this gel creams a little bit"
"more body to it and i just mentioned"
"there's a little bit more of an"
"emollient component to the formulation"
"of this it leaves a semi-radiant finish"
"and it looks like it's going on like a"
"moisturizer this is one of those"
"products that i use straight after"
"rinsing as a one and done product this"
"is my moisturizer my sunscreen has a"
"little bit something extra in there as"
"well but i don't put much underneath"
"this because the texture of this is a"
"little bit more moisturizing you can see"
"as it sets down to me it just leaves a"
"natural glow to the skin i don't think"
"it's it's not very greasy it's not very"
"heavy but it is a moisturizing finish"
"what's interesting is the mattifying the"
"shine control that to me is a bit of a"
"stretch this to me is not modifying in"
"the slightest but it is very oily skin"
"compatible the way i see it is it kind"
"of leaves a natural glow on your face"
"and basically controls your oils from"
"making you look any more shiny but you"
"do have a natural like radiance to you"
"that gives your skin some life you're"
"not flat matte dead but this is arguably"
"i think my favorite in this entire video"
"and i do use this very regularly because"
"it's very convenient for me especially"
"on days when i need a little bit more"
"moisturization next up on the list this"
"is one i think i had a lot of comments"
"when i went to the first european"
"sunscreen video being like try bioderma"
"try bioderma so i got a couple from them"
"this is the bioderma photoderm max spf"
"50 plus aqua fluid no this is the yellow"
"tube this is spf 50 plus and this one"
"has no tint apparently they offer a"
"light tint and then a gold tint for this"
"one i don't know what that gold means i"
"don't know if it means that it's like my"
"complexion or darker but this does also"
"come in tinted versions i just have the"
"regular non-tinted one this was 15 pound"
"this offers high eva evb and t shine"
"protection i found on a separate"
"retailer site because this is no longer"
"on boots website don't know why this had"
"a uva pf specifically of 24 and i'm only"
"noting that because uva"
"circled anywhere on this i don't believe"
"and also it doesn't give me a boot star"
"rating either marketing points pleasant"
"and easy application thanks to a fluid"
"texture as light as water dry touch"
"finish ideal for all skin types even"
"combination to oily sensitive skin or"
"intolerant to all types of sunlight very"
"fair skin with freckles and exposed skin"
"to maximum sunlight those are all the"
"skin types and conditions that this is"
"acceptable for oil-free formula"
"non-greasy texture good skin tolerance"
"non-comedogenic unfragranced water"
"resistant and then main marketing points"
"behind bowdermist sunscreens is they"
"have a cellular bioprotection trademark"
"patent and that is essentially some sort"
"of like antioxidant situation that they"
"say boost the overall sun efficacy and"
"that is some sort of like bioderma"
"proprietary patent on a specific"
"formulation component that boosts sun"
"protection factor of your skin and"
"aiding with the sunscreen it's the"
"marketing for it was really weird but on"
"top of that this also has a synergistic"
"combination of three powders that give a"
"mattifying dry touch finish filters in"
"this this features octokrylan which is"
"dvb into some of the longer wavelength"
"uva tinasorb m which is a hybrid filter"
"it is a chemical filter by composition"
"but it's an insoluble particle so it's a"
"solid particle that's suspended in the"
"formulation so it acts a little bit more"
"like a mineral filter you have able"
"benzone which is uva 1 and uva 2 and"
"then latinos or m i believe is broad"
"spectrum and then tinos orb s which is"
"broad spectrum as well so really good"
"broad spectrum protection and then bumps"
"up on either end as well this is alcohol"
"fragrance and essential oil free which"
"is worth noting because they do make"
"cleanse this is like great for sensitive"
"skin or very compromised skin and then"
"you have the things that help with water"
"resistance the mattifiers this does have"
"more emollience in the formulation i"
"think experience for this you can see as"
"i'm depositing it into the teaspoon this"
"is liquidy and if i could just boil this"
"down to one statement this is like the"
"sister the wannabe sister of the la"
"roche posay and thalios choco fluid"
"sunscreen very similar texture and it"
"feels like it wants to be the same"
"product there's a lot of things that"
"they're not the same first and foremost"
"talking about the uv protection minds"
"you spf 50 plus no uva circled on this"
"that i could find i also did throw away"
"the box though so if you got the box and"
"it circled on there comment that down"
"below but there's also no boot star"
"rating on this either and i did find a"
"uva pf rating of 24 which if you're"
"using like the ppd system like the pa"
"pluses that you see on korean sunscreens"
"this would be a pa 4 plus technically"
"and regardless that is a great daily"
"sunscreen situation the other part of"
"this is the fact that it says it's"
"supposed to be matte with powder dry"
"touch finish if you look on the screen i"
"feel like i look i have a gloss to me"
"it's not greasy but it's like i look"
"shiny and i don't understand that and i"
"don't like the way this looks on my skin"
"if i'm going to be honest part of that"
"reason is because after a little bit i"
"feel like my skin looks dry but oily if"
"that makes any sense but also this has"
"that tenosurp m component and i"
"mentioned it basically functions like a"
"mineral sunscreen it makes this cling to"
"my facial hair so it looks like i"
"essentially have a dusting of like white"
"setting powder all over my mustache my"
"eyebrows my hairline and my beard so"
"this is one thing i like to wear under"
"makeup because i think it does prep the"
"skin nicely for makeup i just don't like"
"it by itself and also the other part of"
"it is it does this thing on like my"
"under eyes where it gives them like a"
"great cast next up though from bioderma"
"again this is their photoderm akn mats"
"notice this is a white bottle and this"
"is spf 30. for this one uva is circled"
"but again no designation on bootstars"
"for this marketing for this a bioderma"
"innovation the exclusive fluid active"
"trademark patent in photoderm akn matte"
"biologically regulates sebum quality to"
"keep pores from becoming clogged and"
"prevent the appearance of blemishes"
"which is often exacerbated after periods"
"of sun exposure photogram akn matte"
"offers real internal biological"
"protection again that cellular"
"bioprotection pen and then it also says"
"this exclusive patent preserves and"
"stimulates the skin's defenses during"
"sun exposure so basically long lasting"
"matte claims non-greasy finish no white"
"cast they want to emphasize this one"
"does have a sense to it and it's also"
"waterproof so talking about some of the"
"claims that fluid active was interesting"
"because this one is matte i mean it's in"
"the name matte this one specifically"
"talks about a patent to regulate sebum"
"and keep the skin matte that the other"
"photoderm didn't have the patented"
"complex fights against sebum thickening"
"in order to keep portion becoming"
"clogged and to minimize the risk of"
"blemishes appearing which is interesting"
"so this features salicylic and glycolic"
"acid i don't think i've ever seen"
"glycolic acid in the sunscreen period"
"and i don't think i've ever seen"
"salicylic acid any sunscreen either"
"those are exfoliants which is fun i like"
"that again one and done products who"
"just love that get your exfoliation and"
"your sun protection all in one go but i"
"think those are partly responsible for"
"that seven regulating benefit salicylic"
"acid as well as the component of"
"preventing the pores from becoming"
"clogged then you also have tocopherol"
"and tocopheroacetate so both forms of"
"vitamin e then you have ectoin and"
"propyl gallate which are antioxidants"
"you also have ginkgo biloba extract"
"which always reminds me of fenty skin"
"love her and then golden kelp which is a"
"kelp extract and kind of aids in water"
"binding so it's like humectant benefits"
"but can also potentially have some skin"
"soothing benefits or antioxidant"
"benefits as well filters this has"
"octopriline so uvb uva2 tinosorb m once"
"again so that's that broad spectrum"
"hybrid filter and then evobenzone for"
"uva protection less filters but"
"interesting assortment again this is"
"only spf 30 which is perfectly adequate"
"great daily protection or if you don't"
"necessarily need the high high high"
"factor because again this is water"
"resistant so it's great for daily on the"
"go or just like minimal sun exposure"
"where for example you might sweat a lot"
"but again it's interesting again i point"
"out this is spf 30 does have that uva"
"circle could not find a uva pf rating"
"for this but the other bio dimmer"
"doesn't have that why is that but as you"
"see with the application similar body"
"similar texture it's very watery"
"lightweight it is giving that la roche"
"posay and thalios fluid this goes on"
"nicely though i think i have a"
"preference for this specific one over"
"the other bioderma what i will say is"
"that i also definitely like to"
"moisturize well underneath this this in"
"itself does have some emollients and"
"body to it but the mattifying effect of"
"this on non-moisturized skin can get"
"very unpleasant very quick so it'll be"
"moisturized very well i think this is"
"beautiful for oily skin i wouldn't"
"recommend these for dry skin i'm gonna"
"be honest just for that finish and"
"texture issue and for either of these if"
"you have deep skin i would not count on"
"these just because of the teenage sort"
"of m elements and then last sunscreen"
"this is the vichy ideal soleil"
"mattifying face dry touch sun cream so i"
"was very excited to try some vichy"
"options vichy to me it's like a very"
"french pharmacy and i don't know why"
"because i think technically bioderma is"
"too but vichy's like the pinnacle of"
"like french pharmacy to me so i was very"
"excited to try this out this is 16 pound"
"50 for 50ml the marketing behind this is"
"idiosola modifying face dry touch spf 50"
"helps protect the skin against the"
"harmful effects of sun into uv has soft"
"dry touch zero shine water resistant"
"finish they do say suitable for"
"combination and sensitive skin and then"
"it's enriched with vichy mineralizing"
"thermal water again this is spf 50 this"
"does have a uva plus circled there is no"
"uva pf indicated on this either but i do"
"trust that this has good protection this"
"formula includes a white spectrum filter"
"system and photostable uva ebv based"
"mixorals mixorals are l'oreal patented"
"filters vichy is a l'oreal sub brand and"
"then that vichy mineral water so a lot"
"of brands like lourish jose vichy really"
"center around this thermal water"
"situation and we should explain it like"
"this vichy mineral water strengthens the"
"natural defenses of the skin the"
"volcanic water of vichy was born from"
"the volcanoes of ovarn rich in 15"
"essential minerals so essentially it's"
"like water that's volcanic water"
"enriched with minerals that can really"
"aid in the skin barrier function and"
"moisturization and blah blah blah so"
"filter wise you have homosalates"
"octosale evinol t150 tinosorp s mixoral"
"xl avobenzone octocrylene mixoryl sx and"
"nanotitanium dioxide so you got a whole"
"salad up in there of uv filters"
"primarily these are all chemical filters"
"we do see that nano titanium dioxide"
"always a concern anytime you see a"
"mineral or mineral adjacent filter but"
"it's nano so that hopefully will aid in"
"a little bit more elegance per se but"
"aside from that this is alcohol free but"
"this is fragrance and this is fragranced"
"underlying exclamation points this is"
"perfumey it's giving macy's fragrance"
"counter the fragrance on this one is"
"strong and if you have compromised skin"
"i'm gonna be honest my eye areas right"
"now very compromised they were on fire"
"when i put this on so i don't know why"
"this is compatible with sensitive skin"
"because i disagree that's just me and"
"then there's a couple botanical based"
"extracts for example there's a cinnamon"
"botanical extract in this which i looked"
"into what it could potentially do skin"
"wise and it has potentially a steady"
"sauce some potential and anti-terrorism"
"and antioxidant benefits which basically"
"means it can kind of help with pigment"
"fading benefits and also some"
"antioxidant protection the big one for"
"this one though is that it's mattifying"
"it's mattifying dry touch i agree with"
"those claims but i didn't find it was a"
"very elegant experience you can see i"
"put it on this is more of a gel"
"situation so it's very reminiscent of"
"the eucerin it's not as moisturizing"
"though it doesn't have that annoyance"
"that the nivea one kind of does this one"
"definitely does have this dry down like"
"dry touch effect that fragrance is so"
"strong it does linger for like at least"
"half an hour afterwards maybe a little"
"bit more and that's definitely just the"
"biggest thing this does have that"
"fragrance to it texture wise this does"
"wear really nice under makeup i find it"
"does prep the skin well i'm wearing it"
"under my face right now if you"
"moisturize well underneath this you"
"don't have any issues with it cleaning"
"to texture or any dry patches on the"
"skin but you do have to moisturize even"
"having oily skin use a gel moisturizer"
"but you will have to pipe your skin"
"adequately for this and you can't see it"
"right now but when i look in the mirror"
"i see it i just have like a coating a"
"dusting of whites on my facial hair my"
"mustache and everything in my eyebrows"
"because of this and i'm going to"
"attribute that more to the titanium"
"dioxide in this so it's not really"
"elegant in dark hair dark facial hair or"
"whatnot so that's another big con if you"
"apply this in the right way this is very"
"nice it's very workable but you will"
"have to tolerate that fragrance so with"
"that that is round two of european"
"chemist pharmacy sunscreens this was a"
"toss up really some of these are not"
"that great or they're like a very"
"mid-tier there's like things i could do"
"to like bump them up but they're just"
"they're not great the nevaeh one i think"
"is my favorite out of all these and i do"

"products with my own money"
"I'll never waste your time with"
"sponsored ads or videos so if you want"
"to help support the channel check out no"
"BS beauty comm check out my patreon"
"community or click on the Amazon link"
"below okay so these were this is another"
"sunscreen I picked up at look"
"fantasticks UK page they should be"
"paying me like a referral fee because"
"I'm advertising for them a lot anyway"
"that's where I picked up most of the"
"European type sunscreens where is in the"
"US it's difficult to get them because"
"the FDA is about 50 years behind on"
"sunscreen approvals literally I think"
"it's like been since 1970 since they"
"approved any new filters something like"
"that something crazy so anyway there's"
"some ways around it I like to find the"
"way around it because you know if you"
"live in the US and you're using a"
"typical chemical sunscreen you're not"
"really getting great UVA coverage and"
"UVA rays are once that cause wrinkles"
"and fine lines and skin damage so keep"
"that in mind most Americans probably"
"would age so much better if they had"
"access to European sunscreens but most"
"I'm probably a lot of them probably"
"don't even know what they're missing"
"until you've tried them and not at least"
"I didn't so anyway Bioderma calls this a"
"very high sun protection with a fluid"
"texture as light as water with a dry"
"touch finish suitable for all skin types"
"even combination to oily skin skin that"
"is sensitive to are intolerant to all"
"types of sunlight very fair-skinned with"
"freckles and skin that as a pole exposed"
"to maximum sunlight or anybody that"
"really just wants to prevent aging okay"
"so let me get to my first criteria which"
"is packaging and I like the packaging"
"nice squeeze to bottle although it does"
"have a tendency to be very goopy when"
"you open it up and it's got kind of a"
"needle nose tip on it so just keep that"
"in mind once you start once you dump it"
"over it'll start leaking out and I'll"
"apply it in a second so okay no issues"
"with that"
"in terms of denatured or drying types of"
"alcohol this does not have any of those"
"so that's always a good thing even"
"though it's got a nice liquid texture no"
"drain alcohols does contain some fatty"
"alcohols such as sea 20-22 which are a"
"good type of alcohol a few of you"
"mention the crave beauty beat the beat"
"the sunscreen beat the Sun sunscreen"
"which I reviewed a few days ago and"
"really liked a lot of the"
"characteristics of it but we're not so"
"excited that alcohol is higher up on the"
"ingredient list in my opinion this is a"
"good alternative to that it's got all of"
"the good characteristics of it without"
"the alcohol so I mentioned that as"
"something worth checking out if you were"
"a very sensitive skin or a bit nervous"
"about that"
"so something worth considering terms of"
"fragrance this does not have any"
"fragrance in it which is great and no"
"scent at all it doesn't even have the"
"chemical sunscreen smell which most or a"
"lot of chemical sunscreens have so this"
"one's awesome because there's literally"
"no scent to it so very great for"
"sensitive skin in terms of the"
"manufacturing location this one is made"
"in France so no issues at all with that"
"SPF coverage which is UVB coverage is"
"50-plus so that means it's great I"
"recommend at least 30 everyday and 50 is"
"great especially if you wear a"
"foundation over your sunscreen the more"
"layers you apply over sunscreen the more"
"diluted the coverage potentially can be"
"I saw on a chart the other day it was a"
"sunscreen product the chart had the list"
"of order of ingredients or what you use"
"so you cleanse you tone serum sunscreen"
"primer then foundation and I thought you"
"know what I always apply my primer"
"before the sunscreen just because any"
"layer you put over it has a potential to"
"kind of decrease the amount of"
"protection you're getting so something"
"worth considering I always play my"
"primer before hand although it kind of"
"sometimes defeats a bit of the point of"
"primer so even just foundation could"
"kind of dilute it a little bit so I"
"that's why I think in my opinion thirty"
"is the least but fifty is good"
"especially if you're gonna play"
"foundation or makeup over it it's just"
"you're getting much better protection"
"although one thing to keep in mind the"
"amok you go over thirty you're not"
"getting you're not getting twenty more"
"than third it kind of decreases a little"
"bit the higher up you go but it's still"
"stronger and better so okay terms of the"
"UVA protection factor this one has a PPD"
"of twenty four which is something I"
"would wanted to remember to mention it"
"more often which is persistent pigment"
"darkening so sixteen and up on that"
"scale qualifies as adequate protection"
"the higher up the number the better some"
"sunscreens have demonstrated a PPD of 65"
"or higher so that's very good coverage"
"so this one's twenty four so that's"
"pretty good up there pretty good up"
"there pretty good pretty high up there"
"so I have no issues with that it's"
"probably much better than the average US"
"sunscreen okay then in terms of the"
"filters used in this we've got Evo Ben"
"zone which is a UV Avery absorber which"
"is typically unstable but it can be"
"helped with the use of other filters in"
"it which can help it be a bit more"
"stable although AVO Ben zone on its own"
"for just UVA rays is probably what most"
"US sunscreens have and it's not not good"
"enough in my opinion so then we've got"
"octo cry lean which is a UVB absorber"
"and it also has the ability to absorb"
"some short UVA rays I'm sorry if you can"
"hear my dogs barking I know someone must"
"be walking up and down the street or"
"there's a squirrel in the yard so I'm"
"sure you can hear it I'm sorry okay"
"then we've got methylene"
"you know there must be like a turkey in"
"the yard or something"
"okay then I've got methylene biz Benza"
"Trion tetramethyl beautiful which is"
"also known as vis acht result which is a"
"broad-spectrum UVA and UVB ray absorber"
"it also has some ability to reflect and"
"scatter UV light so it's a great filter"
"then we've got tin syrup s which is a"
"UVA and UVB ray absorber also very photo"
"stable so we've got a good variety of"
"filters for both UVA and UVB rays so I"
"have no issues with that then we get"
"into the white cast and I will apply it"
"and this one really doesn't have a white"
"cast see how liquidy it comes out man"
"the dogs are just going crazy okay so"
"after you apply it it does take a minute"
"to really soak it in but for the most"
"part there's not much of a white cast"
"initially it looks like you're gonna"
"have a white cast and maybe it has a"
"very mild white cast but for the most"
"part in my opinion this is one of the"
"better sunscreens in terms of white"
"casts because there isn't much once it"
"absorbs really sets to a nice matte"
"finish with not much minimal white cast"
"if anything and there you go so I in my"
"opinion you can't really see a white"
"cast so and after it's so give after you"
"give it a couple minutes to soak in it"
"really has no light cast Lincoln honey"
"what trouble are you causing those tails"
"are just out of control"
"Notty okay so I'll do a pH test just for"
"you guys and gals I love the pH so"
"I would say it's a pH of about five ish"
"maybe five and a half maybe so no issues"
"with that one okay in terms of texture"
"obviously it's a very goopy liquidy"
"texture which isn't always the easiest"
"to work with because it is so liquidy"
"although I guess in the title aqua fluid"
"I guess you get that although what I"
"like about it is after it's soaked in"
"after you've given a few minutes to soak"
"in it really scents to a nice matte non"
"sticky finish which is a big deal for a"
"lot of people so after you give it a"
"minute or two to soak in it's really not"
"sticking doesn't transfer a ton so"
"that's always a nice factor as well so"
"no issues with the texture although I"
"guess it says it's fluid ease of use so"
"smooths over skin very easily slightly"
"hydrating works well over most"
"moisturizers and primers I could give a"
"minute to absorb sets to a nice"
"invisible finish a great option for"
"those that don't wear foundation or even"
"if you do our foundation good option for"
"that too but I know a lot of people that"
"don't wear foundation really like"
"something that sets to a nice matte"
"finish with no noticeable white cast so"
"there we go"
"and now that it's absorbed it's not"
"sticky at all so very nice okay then in"
"terms of antioxidants and beneficial"
"ingredients this one contains a lot of"
"slip and basic hydrating ingredients not"
"a ton of real beneficial ingredients or"
"antioxidants which is kind of in my"
"opinion the major downside with this one"
"is there's really not a ton of great"
"stuff it's got vitamin E which is great"
"xylitol and mannitol which are both"
"humectants and that's about it for"
"really exciting beneficial ingredients"
"so if you're gonna use this one I really"
"recommend applying over a really good"
"vitamin C serum or another great"
"hydrating serum or moisturizer so"
"that's got some good things for your"
"skin so your skin isn't just totally"
"relying on this to do it all because it"
"really it can it can block the Rays but"
"it can't help really hydrate skin or"
"anything else for that matter so keep"
"that one in mind that in terms of acne"
"genic ingredients does have a few acne"
"triggers so we've got glyceryl stearate"
"citrate which is a fungal acne trigger"
"and then vitamin E which is can be very"
"acne genic for some people so that's"
"about it so pretty friendly for acne"
"prone skin with the exception of the"
"vitamin E then we've got animal testing"
"and unfortunately Bioderma is not"
"cruelty free which surprised me because"
"for some reason I guess it's been a"
"while since I reviewed anything for"
"Bioderma but they are sold in mainland"
"China so they're not cruelty free then"
"in terms of performance I'm really happy"
"with it lasts nicely on skin without"
"breaking up foundation or becoming oily"
"or greasy feeling throughout the day"
"partially water resistant as well great"
"for sensitive skin especially with the"
"fact that has no alcohol and no"
"fragrance performs above average it"
"exceeded my expectations in my opinion"
"so it's quite happy with it it does take"
"a little bit of finesse to remove at the"
"end of the day the more water resistant"
"the sunscreen is the trickier I find"
"them to be to remove they just require a"
"bit more effort so if you use this one"
"might be wise to do a two step cleanse"
"so oil based cleanser first and then a"
"soapy cleanser after that just to make"
"sure you move it all because you"
"certainly don't want to go to bed with"
"any traces of sunscreen on your skin"
"just for so many reasons especially acne"
"and things like that okay then in terms"
"of the price so this is the full size"
"which is 1.33 ounces which is the"
"equivalent of 40 milliliters and retails"
"for about 17 dollars wherever your look"
"so that averages out to about 42 cents"
"per milliliter which is in the very"
"affordable ring"
"it's not the cheapest sunscreen I've"
"reviewed but it's also not the most"
"expensive so that's a nice factor so on"
"the saris car scale with 15 being"
"perfect this one is guarded 12 so pretty"
"good couple things I might mess with on"
"it maybe not but overall it's still"
"pretty pretty darn good option so anyway"
"I'm interested in hearing from you guys"
"if you've had a chance to try this I"
"think there's another Bioderma product"
"coming up that I'll be reviewing this"
"week as well so be sure to stay tuned"
"for that one so anyway I love hearing"
"from you guys so leave your comments and"
"I will see you more tomorrow thank you"
"so much guys"
"well hey guys it is Saturday it's the"
"weekend before a New Year's Eve New"
"Year's Day so yeah you're watching this"
"the weekend after more than likely but"
"this morning I cracked into a new"
"sunscreen and I finished up the one that"
"I was using before from Europe and I"
"cracked into you this morning I cracked"
"into the via derma photo jar max I think"
"it's called SPF 50 plus also from Europe"
"that one of you all sent me I really"
"like it it's very liquidy so you know"
"it's it it's fragrance free as as all of"
"the European sunscreens it's got UVA"
"filters that are a little bit more photo"
"stable than those we have here in the US"
"and I blend it in really nicely to the"
"skin no white cast moisturizing that"
"there wasn't like any alcohol leanness"
"to it"
"I think oily skin types would like it"
"yeah but anyways I'm headed over to my"
"mom's house we're gonna have some lunch"

"sounds right to me"
"I should have Google Google guest a"
"guest that before I got on here but"
"anyways this is a sunscreen from France"
"and yeah I did a little research on the"
"ingredients online so I can be sure give"
"you some accurate information rather"
"just saying and it feels great"
"this contains one one filter that I"
"wanted to talk about it has a really"
"long name so I didn't write it down here"
"hon on a cute little little pineapple"
"post-it note it's this ethyl axial oxy"
"phenol methoxy phenol triazine which is"
"essentially a bit much the motrin demo"
"trigonal which the trade name see this"
"is why sometimes having trade names is"
"helpful because who wants to say all"
"that but the trade name is tennis orb"
"and tennis or blocks is a filter that"
"will effectively cover both UVB and UVA"
"it is very very very photo stabile and"
"what I mean by photostable oil is that"
"when exposed to ultraviolet light from"
"the Sun it remains stable on the skin it"
"doesn't degrade and so it maintains its"
"its UV blocking capacity more so over"
"what is commonly found in many of our"
"sunscreens here in the US and buys us"
"UVA protection which is ava Ben's own"
"okay and furthermore tennis orb is nice"
"because it it when it's added to others"
"other other other filters alike Ava"
"Ben's own it can further stabilize those"
"so in the present it makes Ava Ben's own"
"do a little better ok it's kind of like"
"sound like a tutor or okay for Ava benzo"
"and it just it just helps it along so in"
"short you know the European sunscreens"
"have this ingredient and similar filters"
"and other sunscreens that are chemical"
"you know in Japan"
"it's been approved in Europe since 2000"
"okay the u.s. is so slow on this"
"bandwagon it's painful here in the US"
"you know we have Mex real and like"
"unlike some of the LA roche-posay stuff"
"that you can get over the counter which"
"you know stabilizes a Levin zone to a"
"certain degree but it's not as fantastic"
"as the biskits rise all and demet rise"
"all ingredients I don't know why they've"
"taken so long to to get them approved"
"here and then you add a spot that is"
"that and another note about this filter"
"so it's 10 the the trade name is tin"
"sorb s okay there's also a tennis or"
"best aqua which I learned about today"
"tennis or s aqua is basically the tennis"
"orb in a sort of methyl methacrylate"
"matrix if you will"
"dispersion kind of thing which basically"
"allows it to go into water okay and I'm"
"not sure Bioderma has utilized that I"
"didn't look into that but I feel as"
"though it has and the reason that that's"
"cool is that it allows it to go into"
"water so it helps you know that the"
"filter is can can be dispersed in that"
"in sort of a liquidy form versus here in"
"the US you know ayiva been zone is"
"largely oil soluble so a lot of the"
"chemical sunscreens people complain or"
"just to oil and make them shiny make"
"them greasy okay so you know yes"
"tennis orb as far as a chemical filter"
"is a little it's superior to do the ones"
"we have in the u.s. period you know it's"
"a little bit more stable and it's the"
"aesthetics of how it can go on and what"
"it can can do as far as as the vehicle"
"make it more desirable to consumers okay"
"so it has a larger consumer appeal and"
"that's really important because you know"
"a big big big problem with sunscreens I"
"mean you know in general is not so much"
"you know that the filter degrades or"
"that you know the you know whatever it's"
"really failure to use okay so that's why"
"I always tell you guys you're always"
"like what's the best sunscreen blah blah"
"blah and what's the one that you like"
"and use because you know I can"
"on and on about the different filters"
"and that sort of thing but you know if"
"it leaves a white Sheen on your face"
"you're not gonna want to wear it you're"
"not gonna run it want to reapply it's"
"gonna be difficult if it makes you all a"
"shiny greasy you're not gonna like that"
"either okay and you know at the end of"
"the day it has to be something that you"
"comfortably can put on and and and use"
"for yourself I really really wish the US"
"would get this here you know we could"
"get this here in the u.s. in Japan and"
"you know Asia they have them in their"
"sunscreens and so I'm very grateful to"
"you for sending it to me another note"
"about the Bioderma are just these"
"sunscreens that contain tennis or but"
"another note about tennis or that I"
"don't know maybe you all will find"
"helpful you know I talked about my"
"sunscreen QA there's all this fear"
"around cancer promoting effects of some"
"of the chemical filters you know in the"
"laboratory studies if you put a bunch of"
"like some of our chemical filters on"
"cells and a dish you know you can see up"
"regulation and certain estrogen and"
"related genes and that's like very scary"
"to people in general you know for"
"potential breast cancer promoting"
"properties as I said in that video just"
"objectively speaking all the long-term"
"data that we have from from human use"
"does not support any sort of"
"cancer-causing promoting of the facts"
"okay"
"but you know I'm you know I tell you"
"that that's the objective information"
"but you know I'm Amanda thetic to to the"
"concern you know if you if you know you"
"or anybody you know has ever had a"
"cancer before I mean nobody really I can"
"totally relate to you not wanting to"
"wait on the science to parse things out"
"you know and just that that that slight"
"tinge of uncertainty I totally relate to"
"that I'm so a note about tennis orb you"
"know is that unlike the other filters in"
"those laboratory studies did not show"
"any estrogen kind of regulating effects"
"or estrogen dependent gene gene kind of"
"alterations if you all okay so you know"
"if that's something that you fear"
"you know objectively speaking hopefully"
"the information that I give to give you"
"maybe can help you make an informed"
"decision but you know I completely"
"completely understand still not feeling"
"comfortable putting it on your face and"
"wanting to avoid some of these chemical"
"filters here in the US you know if you"
"can't you know fly to the Netherlands or"
"France whatever and get these or Japan"
"and you you know"
"Amazon's too expensive for you here in"
"the US you know you've gotten zinc and"
"titanium dioxide and zinc oxide alone is"
"really pretty good at both UVB and UVA"
"titanium dioxide is a little less"
"fantastic at the UVA but they're both"
"they're both good and you know in"
"combination they're wonderful"
"unfortunately they're the ones that are"
"going to make you look white you know I"
"have the white film so you know there's"
"that and so selecting ones that they"
"have you know micro-sized the the zinc"
"and titanium dioxide can kind of help"

"the products in I'm excited I've got"
"three more in my cart although I don't"
"really need three more but I just want"
"to try them all and they're on sale"
"so anyway I'm really getting good at the"
"smuggling stuff I don't have to take it"
"up a notch - maybe like acids maybe"
"start smuggling in some really good BHA"
"products I don't know I guess I'll I'll"
"see what I can move up to in the world"
"okay so Bioderma calls this a sunscreen"
"with cellular bio protection patent to"
"improve skins defenses against the Sun"
"UVA protection of 42 and UVB protection"
"of 50 plus and when they talk about UVA"
"protection of 42 they are going off the"
"PPD persistent pigment darkening"
"gradient system and I believe anything"
"that's a 16 and over is like rated the"
"best or like PA with four pluses after"
"it and this one's got 42 so 16 is great"
"42 is like out of this world which is"
"amazing okay nourishing cream that is"
"easy to spread the skin is protecting"
"hydrated fragrance free non comedogenic"
"hypoallergenic and water resistant okay"
"so I get to my first criteria which is"
"packaging and you know I noticed a lot"
"of sunscreens come in yellow bottles I"
"don't know why that is but so many of"
"them do it just as looking through all"
"my thumbnails I'm like yellow yellow"
"yellow what ones that one is that anyway"
"I don't quite get it but I have no"
"problem with it in terms of denatured or"
"drying types of alcohol this does not"
"contain any of those it does contain C"
"20-22 alcohols which are fatty types of"
"alcohol which are good or"
"hydrating foreskin so I don't know so"
"many of these alcohols contain a lot of"
"alcohol but Bioderma to figure out how"
"to do it without it"
"so what are they doing or what do they"
"know that all these other brands don't I"
"don't know they know something okay so I"
"get to fragrance and there's no"
"fragrance ingredients although it has a"
"very very mild almost like corn smell"
"like it smells a little bit like corn"
"but it goes away pretty quickly I don't"
"know how else describe maybe cornbread"
"just a very light almost barely"
"noticeable scent my nose is very"
"sensitive though so I don't know but"
"it's not bad doesn't bother me so the"
"manufacturing location for this one is"
"France so no issues with that SPF on"
"this one is 50 plus and since made in"
"France they are only allowed to go up to"
"50 so anything with a 50 plus indicates"
"really good coverage probably 60 or"
"above from what I'm hearing from you"
"guys so it's pretty impressive"
"protection from UVB rays then we get to"
"the UVA protection factor and this one"
"is excellent far far above average this"
"has like a plus plus UVA protection the"
"PPD level is 42 or PPD number anything"
"over 20 on the PPD number is considered"
"awesome great excellent 16 above is"
"passing I guess so the protection of"
"this one is just ridiculously high which"
"makes a great option for those who spend"
"a lot of time outside those who have"
"significant hyperpigmentation issues"
"those who have a history of skin cancer"
"makes the bio during some sunscreens a"
"really great option so they have done an"
"amazing job with their photo derm line"
"I've been impressed with both of them"
"now I'm gonna be buying more so ok the"
"filters used for this one we've got you"
"v'l n 539 which is also known as octo"
"cry lean which is an oil soluble"
"chemical sunscreen agent which protects"
"skin in the UVB range and somewhat in"
"the UVA range and it's also one that"
"helps evil bends on be a bit more stable"
"more effective and it's also one that"
"people can have a lot of allergies to I"
"think it's one of the more common"
"ingredients where people are reporting"
"side effects or allergies from it so"
"keep that one in mind"
"then we've got tin sorb M which is a"
"hybrid filter that both reflects and"
"absorbs both UVB and UVA rays which is"
"impressive"
"then we've got Evo Ben's own there we go"
"the UVA reabsorb ER and then tensor s"
"filter a very photostable filter which"
"absorbs both UVB and UVA rays so a"
"pretty good impressive lineup of filters"
"that they've used then we get to white"
"cast and um I'm kind of impressed with"
"this one so they're plies pretty nicely"
"there's a very very mild white cast I"
"know right now it looks pretty blinding"
"but once it absorbs it's more mild so"
"not super super noticeable and the more"
"it absorbs into skin the less it looks"
"but it is a mild very mild white cast"
"and how the longer you wear it the less"
"its noticeable but if you're gonna"
"reapply it that also becomes a bit more"
"of an issue because the white cast"
"you're playing over foundation and"
"things like that so we'll talk more"
"about reapplying things and half and you"
"have to do it during the live stream but"
"anyway once it absorbs the white cast is"
"very very mild not super noticeable then"
"we've got texture which it's got kind of"
"a lotion aid cream texture to it which"
"absorbs pretty quickly once you smooth"
"it in once it absorbs though it sets to"
"kind of a sticky and tacky finish it's"
"almost like it doesn't fully feel like"
"it dries down so if you apply foundation"
"over it it's not gonna be as big of a"
"deal but it is very slightly tacky and"
"kind of sticky not as bad as some other"
"ones I've tried like the drunk elephant"
"sunscreens those are always super"
"to me but it is slightly sticky and"
"tacky and I would say the finish for"
"this one is slightly radiant if you like"
"a matte finish their photo fluid while I"
"reviewed is kind of a better option but"
"this one sets to kind of a more natural"
"radiant finish which is slightly sticky"
"so not the worst not the best but pretty"
"decent still overall then we get to"
"ease-of-use and it does take a bit of"
"smoothing and effort to really apply it"
"and to get it to smooth over evenly"
"takes a bit of effort the texture is"
"rather hydrating so this works better my"
"opinion if you apply it directly over a"
"serum instead of using like you"
"typically in the morning I'll use a"
"essence then a serum and then a"
"moisturizer and then my sunscreen this"
"one works better if you just eliminate"
"the moisturizer step and just apply it"
"directly over a serum just because it is"
"rather hydrating seems to feel like it"
"creates a bit of a seal over skin which"
"is probably because the water resistance"
"so it can be a bit fussy to apply"
"certain foundations over them usually"
"foundations that are rather hydrating or"
"amoliant can be a bit iffy to apply over"
"and then foundations that are super"
"matte can also be a bit tricky but"
"overall it's still pretty easy to use"
"it's just not dummy-proof which is"
"probably why it took me a month to"
"figure it out no I'm just kidding haha"
"I'm so funny I really can be funny when"
"I try though so anyway okay"
"antioxidants and beneficial ingredients"
"in this one but a lot of hydrating and"
"moisturizing ingredients a lot of slip"
"ingredients in this one we've also got a"
"few good ingredients we've got mannitol"
"xylitol fructooligosaccharides which are"
"great hydrating and moisturizing"
"ingredients then we've got Ram nose ROM"
"nose which is a ingredient which has"
"demonstrated positive effects in both"
"epidermal and dermal compartments of"
"in-vitro reconstructed skin moreover"
"such in vitro findings were obtained"
"that has an effect on collagen four and"
"pro-collagen one per day"
"action so that's great for skin then"
"we've got a ingredient which is known"
"abroad which is a brown seaweed known as"
"antelope kine"
"6 I'm sure I slaughtered the name of"
"that it's an ingredient that helps"
"protect skin from oxidative stress"
"caused by over exposure to sunlight so"
"that makes it a natural fit for a"
"sunscreen it's also rich in plant"
"sterols that support the skin in a wide"
"range of ways and then we've got act"
"eine which is an ingredient that helps"
"protect the skin from environmental"
"stressors such as natural item"
"pollutants so we don't have a super long"
"list of antioxidants and beneficial"
"ingredients but we do have some AB note"
"and a lot of ammonia ingredients so"
"overall I was kind of impressed with it"
"I don't know at least some of the"
"ingredients that they included as"
"beneficial ingredients actually play"
"directly to a sunscreen instead of just"
"some random things so I don't know"
"overall I was happy with it then we've"
"got acne genic ingredients and this"
"surprised me because it does have a bit"
"of a thicker creamy texture to it but it"
"only has one ingredient of note for acne"
"prone skin which is paid 100 stearate"
"which is a slightly comedogenic"
"ingredient but that's it so overall I"
"was pretty impressed with that so if you"
"have acne prone skin this is a great"
"option and there's not a lot of really"
"great options out there so this is a"
"good one then we get to animal testing"
"and unfortunately Bioderma is not"
"cruelty free which I always every time I"
"review a product if there's I was up to"
"Google cuz I was thinking the back of my"
"head they are but they're not so that's"
"important to note there we get to"
"performance and this one will absolutely"
"highly protect your skin from sun damage"
"from uva and UVB rays highly protect"
"your skin like very good protection"
"lasts pretty well throughout the day it"
"can become a little bit greasy towards"
"the very end of the day after 8 or 9"
"hours of wear it can start to look a"
"little shiny but not tear"
"believe so overall I was pretty"
"impressed with this sunscreen for so"
"many reasons high protection several"
"unique beneficial ingredients great for"
"acne prone skin well packaged well"
"formulated so overall I was more"
"impressed than not so then we get to the"
"price and this is the full size which is"
"1.33 ounces 40 milliliters which is a"
"bit tinier than most other sunscreens"
"also in a retails for about $24 making"
"it 60 cents a milliliter making it a bit"
"more expensive per milliliter than a lot"
"of other sunscreens I've reviewed but"
"it's still rather affordable for"
"something that's so effective so overall"
"with a 15 being a perfect score this one"
"got a 14 which is pretty darn good yeah"
"so anyway I'm interested in hearing from"

I tried this just to find something new since my regular sunscreen is made in Thailand, so I was not so confident about its
effectiveness.This is the best sunscreen so far.It glides on easily, leaves some white cast at first, but disappears after a
few minutes.It stays on without a trace, does not cause any problems with my makeup, does not make my skin shine at
all.It works well in humid and hot city like Bangkok.Must use a cleanser or Micellar water to remove it.I have very
sensitive skin, and this sunscreen feels fine, no breakout or anything.Will stock up for sure.
I was happy to find a sunscreen that matched my skin color and had SPF50. I was also happy cause the consistency
was nice and light but then I used it and I realize that it leaves my skin super shiny. I don't recommend it for oily skin.
This sunscreen is effective and easily accessible for people in Europe. For me, the pros end here.It is in no way, shape or
form a sunscreen that should be used by people with Oily or even Combination skinned users. It goes on nicely only to
explode into puddles of oil in the space of a couple of hours. It feels heavy even if the consistency is very thin and liquidy.
It balls up under makeup, the only kind of foundation I can use with this is a light dusting of power foundation. I used it up
just because it would be a total waste of money, but I only used it on weekends during spring summer if I wasn't wearing
makeup. There are other wonderful sunscreen options by Bioderma, and I love the brand itself, but this was a fail for me.
I generally find trouble finding an SPF that is light and won't break me out as my skin is oily. This one left my skin shiny
and broke me out to the point that I stopped using it.
I really wanted to love this but like the other reviewers I found this shiny and with a bit of a greasy feel. I live in the US
and bought this from Amazon as I was looking for a European sunscreen that offered strong broad spectrum protection.
I'll continue to use this as it cost about $28.
I have been using this product more than a week. In my opinion, it is very good. I use it directly yo my bare skin, then
after that I put Laura Mercier sill creme foundation on top of it, then finishing powder (revlon). It is winter time now. I find it
non greasy, non oily, non sticky. The texture is very very liquid. It doesn't leave any white traces. Doesn't make my skin
break out. I feel moist all the day (12 hours), for just normal activity (office work). Not sure how I will feel when it comes
Summer time. I use SPF 50 eventhough it is Summer, as i read a review says Radiation still continues even if it is winter
time, as long as the sun shines. So it is better to use SPF 50 everyday. I don't have spots / freckles on my face at the
moment, but from SK-II Magic Ring test, I can see the invisible spots that eventually will appear to my face one day as I
grow older. I used to use SK-II Cellumination day surge UV with SPF 30. But I guess it is not enough.. i am scared now.
Hence I bought Photoderm with SPF50 to replace SK-II day cream. it is up to you ladies to believe or not.. but it is better
to protect now rather than to cure the spots in the future. i promise myself to always use SPF50 every day.. face and
neck... winter spring summer and autumn.
This isnot a bad sunscreen. I love the sunscreen actives: Tinosorb S and M with stabilized AVobenzone and
Octocrylene. So its broad spectrum covering the gamut of UV exposure. I've even read that Tinosorb M is superior to
zinc oxide as its part-chemical/part-physical action covers the higher end of UVA rays. However, I'm not completely sold
on this sunscreen. Firstly, the alcohol denat is too dring for me. My skin ends up feeling lackluster at the end of the day.
Remember that alchol denat can cause skin inflammation, just fyi. Two, the finish is quite greasy At the beach? Sure! In
the office? No. Im searching for a sunscreen for everyday use and unfortunately this is not it. That said, I love the
Tinosorb complex and use Avene's SPF 50 (same ingredients but with no alcohol) that is much gentler on the skin and
great for days when I'm out in the sun. My HG everyday tinosorb sunscreenis Ducray Melascreen SPF 50.
This is grease city but i like the fact that its very fine and is great under makeup. So I use when i know im getting a lot of
sun but still need makeup, this is it. More elegantly formulated than the photoderm max spot, which i like better but there
is a place for this. Not for anyone other dry or combo dry. I have to blot a few times after this absorbs and throughout the
day. No breakouts either. I will finish but will not repurchase.
This review is for Photoderm MAX SPF50+ Ultra Fluid Tinted Light.In my opinion, this is a very good sunscreen for
summer days when you have a little tan and you don't want to use foundation.I have oily and acne-prone skin and is true
that it looks a little oily, but if you blend it very well and blot it exactly after you have applied it(to remove the excess of oil
this sunscreen has), I think it looks very nice,natural and dewy for summer look. You can also use a little powder if you
want a matte finish, but I prefer a more dewy finish for summer. A big plus: it didn't break me out at all!I will definitely buy
again next summer!
God this is so oily and shiny,I could be a mirror for someone when i have this thing on my face. And after i came out of
the water my face is still oily. But good sides are that even this is so shiny and oily it doesnt gave me breakouts,my
sensitive skin is calm and it really protects my skin from sun.
I was recommended this by a friend as I have eczema, I already like the other products from another range. This
sunscreen is very liquid, when I applied it on my face, it feels oily. I do not think everyone will like this and it is quite
expensive. However, it blends easily and I use it under bb cream, eyeliner and eyebrow pencil. My first bottle lasted so
long! I use it everyday before I go out. The packaging has changed though from a white bottle to orange coloured one but
it still has the nozzle.
It doesn't leave a white cast on my NC/NW20-25 skin, but oh boy, isn't it shiny, making me look as if I'd immersed my
skin in oil. I don't even have oily skin to begin with. Will be used up on my body.
