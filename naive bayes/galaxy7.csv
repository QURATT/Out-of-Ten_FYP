What’s your hot take on battery life?
Note 7 is like Gia Carangi
The phones were secretly designed by Michael Bay
This smartphone is mind BLOWING!
This phone just blew up my mind
The hand grenade
The phone that popped
Looks like people had a blast using this
This phone was a BANGER 😀
Puedo comprarlo?
and they still exploded
This phone is such a blast! It surely blew everyone away..
"MKBHD: &quot;So I have to charge it every night...&quot;<br>Battery: <b>SO, YOU HAVE CHOSEN... DEATH.</b>"
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been 5 years since this phone was released. The phone was on fire and a blast that time as what many recalled.
Great phone hope i bet it&#39;s a safe device
This was an amazing phone apple sucks

Don&#39;t buy samsung note 7 (because can explode) or just buy it if you want die
The phone is an absolute BANGER. Easilly the most FIRE product on sale.
"<b>Pocket-bombs!</b><br><br><i>Pocket-bombs have the tendency to explode at random and leak radium, uranium and arsenic. While they may look like smartphones, they are actually BOMBS and are to be handled with extreme care</i>"
You missed the part where it explodes mid-call
People in 2022:  Whats ur phone??<br>User:  Galaxy Note 7 (with pride)<br>2022:  GET AWAY FROM ME
That phone is fire ngl
I wanted to see it explode
This phone is so seductive damn!

Ah yes the Samsung <b>bomb</b>
boom！
Can&#39;t believe we used to live in a time where people walked around with tactical nukes in their back pockets
"Six years later and this phone &quot;exploded&quot; on the collectible market. People swap the battery to the smaller Note FE batteries and install older ROMs just to use it. Not gonna lie, this phone&#39;s design aged quite well imo."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m26s"">3:26</a>; OOH, damn someboy in trouble for taking a note 7 on a plane!"

good phone. greater bomb
Haha it’s water resistant
yay so explosively good!!!!! 😊
I continue to come back to this comment section for the laughs 😆
I still have this phone and never updated it 😂 Samsung UK keep calling me trying to get me to return it several times every year because they can see the phone is still actively used through my serial number apparently. Keep telling them no but they&#39;ve offered me all sorts for the last 5 years. This year I got offered the fold or any s21 varient as a replacement for my bomb 💣<br><br>I don&#39;t have any plans to return it because I might be the only dickhead in the UK to still have one 🇬🇧





The sides sure do melt
i also using Samsung Galaxy Note 4 💋 💋 💋 💋 💞💞💞💞💚💚💚
Even a great company like Samsung can make a leman .
hey 7 is my favourite number😝
the true death note
Apple could’ve had a blast in Ad’s with this one. I’m sure Samsung would have not hesitated if it was the other way around and neither their users.

Oh no he used a bomb phone for a few weeks

I pooped my pants when my note 10 plus started heating while watching this video..
I am note20
"YouTube : I see the note 20 ultra is out,  lemme recommend you note 7"
Still one of the hottest phones ever (2020)
How is no one talking about the fact that the ones with the new batteries ended up exploding aswell.

Me watching in 2020 from my reccomened : I see...
I wonder whether the phone still exists with mqbhd
Watching this from my Galaxy Note 20 I miss the Galaxy Note 7 😭

I am sure bakugo uses this phone
How funny would it be if the phone exploded in his hand on camera
The note 7 is the bomb
"It&#39;s weird to look back on the Note 7, in my eyes. It was the last &quot;classic&quot; samsung phone (as far as design goes) in my eyes. The note 7 also pioneered the facial scanning tech that we see in almost every phone today. The Note 7 was actually very revolutionary, but it&#39;s revolutionary features are not well remembered because of one burning issue."
Hahaha phone go boom
AH HES TRYING TO NUKE US

If you have Note7 install something that disables updates because the newest update will kill your phone (it cant charge)

I&#39;m glad they changed the design for note 8 and future notes. This one was looking dated even for 2016..
2020 where u at
Good to see that you were alive thru out the video
"Goddamnit, that was such a great experience while at lasted, having wanted a Note phone for a while and weaving in and out of android and ios phones, I finally got my first Note in the form of the Note 7....then I had to fucking give it back. It was such a beautiful experience and an elegantly designed phone. I enjoy my Note 10+, and the regular Note 10 is closer in size to the traditional Notes of the past, but that was a bitter pill to swallow when it was forcibly recalled."
Came back to this video for nostalgic purposes lol I wish I didn&#39;t have to return this phone back then because of the battery issue. I loved this phone!
Lol.....i am watching it in 2020..<br>WTF....
Who watch this in 2020?
you are lucky man
"Damn, this was a damn great phone. It even holds up today. To bad what happened to it."
It&#39;s gonna explode mate
"&quot;A headphone jack, of course&quot;"
The battery was fire
<b>The Osama Bin Ladin Of Samsung</b>
"Looking back, they did one hell of a good job managing the fallout of this. This was serious enough to wreck the reputation of even established players, and they really started kicking it once they moved to crisis management mode. The decision to discontinue this phone was simply brilliant...any other choice would have been catastrophic. Their communication after x2 was great, and they went the long mile with the fire-resistant shipping materials they spent a fortune on to get the devices back...which was a sold investment as as a high-profile incident during return (though unlikely given the lack of charging) could have been the nail in the coffin. The hit they took buying the devices back for more than owners originally paid was also the right call."
This was a blast....
95% of the comments: <b>That damn phone blew the market!</b><br>2% of the comments: The phone itself<br>2% The video itself<br><br>1% (Me) I want the phone<br><b>Head turns</b>
This phone has a new feature. <br>Instant camp fire starter. <br><br>Beat that Apple.

😑 youtube recommended me this
"2019, watching to see if he talked about the phone doing boom?"
"Misleading. Both batches had the explosion problem, so you’re basically tricking people into buying a Note 7 thinking it’s safe, when it’s not."
did you just say &quot;jif&quot;?
2019 Nov??<br>Youtube trolling as we need heater to warm rooms in winter in November :D :p<br>But definitely not explosive tech!
Did your note 7 exploded?

Watching this on the note 9
We could’ve used this in war
Who else watching it on there Note 10+ ?
We all are again united by YouTube algorithm 😅🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥!
This phone exploded on the market
Review of a bomb 😑
"THIS PHONE WAS LITTTTT<br><br>(yes, I had to make a reference to it blasting)"
little he knows he will have to turn that one in also
note 10 is out....with that said i really liked the note 7 and i have the note 8. Something about the note 7 that really jumped at me. Having to turn it back in was tough and having to do it a second time was awful
Little did he know he was holding a c4
This phone came out the same year of Konosuba if you are an anime fan you know what I mean😏

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m26s"">3:26</a><br>He had it on a fucking plane"
The best hand grenade ever!
I am using this phone from 2 year  there  no any problems  with it

&quot;and a headphone jack of course&quot; ouch
watching in 2019 and this phone is taking real bad images

This is an <b>EXPLOSIVE</b> reveiw
Still. This is the best intro from mkbhd
"WTF YT , why recommend this in 2019?"
Man it&#39;s so weird that this phone came out 2 years ago only 2 years have gone by but it has felt like 4 years for me. Also everyone saying rip note 7 should stop because the phone is still being sold as the note fe.
Samsung skin before one ui was ew xd
U r lucky enough to survive with this phone
2020 any one ?
YouTube now?? Great
BOOM!!!   That all you need to know about the note 7
YouTube is literally recommending every old MKBHD video it’s hilarious
è una bomba
Didnt know MKBHD reviewed Bomb back in 2016
“Built really well!”
Samsung Galaxy stick bomb 7
Wow I want this phone
"till this day, this was the last Note/Phone that I was giddy about. I literally would just take it out to look at it, mess with it. I was just enamored at how it was built and ran. Have the Note8 currently with the 10+ on the way, and still, no phone has really, truly excited me since this Note 7,"
Note 8 is the best
"What can I say but, ITS HOT! HOT! HOT!"
Now the note 10 got released
"If I could, I&#39;d buy a Note7, of course, keep it sealed on my phone collection."
It&#39;s funny how YT recommend me this video in 2019
Yeah no
Still better then the Note 10 LOL


At least this one has a headphone jack
Jif...
Rip
That phone is da bomb<br><br>Literally and Figuratively
Back when the note phones had only one camera
<b>BOOM</b>
"Wow, I can&#39;t wait till this thing releases!"
Better not put it on airplane mode.
Some say he still keeps it to this day
Who else is here in August 2019 after Note 10?

Cool design it had...maybe a thicc baterry would have benn ok
My question is why dont the s7 edge have an iris scanner but the note does?
3 years later and the Note 7 is still the bomb!
"I wish Samsung would make their own operating system, so it could actually compete against iOS with a Samsung based operating phone.<br><br>They could make their own phone units that could be more powerful than Android and possibly iOS.<br><br>If Samsung was able to make the note 10 look and process the way it&#39;s going to be revealed with Android, they can absolutely make their own operating system."


"I&#39;d say this is the best EXTERNAL design of a Galaxy. I miss the original home button, and the omission of Bixby button. Might be looking for a Note FE before too long."
Bomb review
Dynamite: Am I a joke to you?
another good thing about this phone is that it blows up it&#39;s a really interesting and neat feature the first phone to use this technology even to this day
Took 2 years to see this video but still a good video
i can say it can survie a drop from 1000 ft !
Note 7 just BURNED the place☢ <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>With fire...<br>Not with features.😂

Still loving this video in 2019.
"Watching this on my note 7, I never actually returned it. works solidly to this day. Don&#39;t know when will I die though."

Most useless vedio on the youtube😂😂😂😂
Note 8 gang hit like

"This review was an EXPLOSION. Sorry, I needed to do that joke."
who else is watching this in july 2019?
This isn&#39;t new... Osama had this phone on him when he did 9/11. Samsung is just making it look like it&#39;s some &quot;new design&quot; when they&#39;re just recycling old technology. Disappointed in Samsung.
"So,YouTube actually recommended this after 2 and and a half years?"
"If this was Apple: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m37s"">1:37</a>"
This should be called a Samsung bomb review
2016 4gbs of ram <br>Please learn google!!!!

Little does he know he is holding a grenade disguised as a phone..

Imagine the phone blowing when he is making a review 😃
I gave my galaxy note 7 to Samsung to refund or . Atleast fix it . Bc it was completely disabled by the new update. I wasn&#39;t able to use it at all . And than Samsung never gave my phone back. . Only thing I did wrong was . Gave the phone back to samsung in December while the phones note 7s were blacklisted months before .
I didn&#39;t know they were switching the battery out with a c4.

2019?!
It&#39;s a hot phone. I love how the reviewer states that the glass melts over the front edges of the screen. The rest of the Samsung phone can also melt over the front of the screen.

BOOM!
I&#39;m looking forward to the Note FE getting cheap. That Onyx black was the best color Samsung ever made

My main phone is an iphone x. But recently picked up an FE after the price drop. And using it feels so much more modern than an x with the actually bezelles sides. Battery life after the update to one UI is amazing too

Yeah. Btw after all we can buy note FE. So what we worried about 😁

"And not much time later, even the &quot;safe&quot; Note 7s start exploding. Samsung cancels all of them, and a year later launces the Note FE, with the smaller battery."
Who else came for the comments?



FE?
Nice weapon <br>This must be in counter strike
Who is planning to buy the note fe
"Even in 2018, it&#39;s still the <b>bomb</b>"

And we here with Note 9 but this phone is a legend that just had a short life
"Little did he know, he had a time bomb."
Samsung decided to go all jihad on us
I wish i have that phone😍
Galaxy Note 7 mile radius
"I remember when the note 7 was revealed, i wanted it so bad that i kept begging for my dad to buy it for me."

That is one sexily dangerous smartphone.
RIP Note 7<br>Note 9 upcoming tho
In s7 there battery is 3600 nah battery<br>And they try to increase more battery that&#39;s why it started blasting in s8+ there battery is 3500mah

Samsung Terrorist Note 7
can i buy this one off  you
"God I love this design, it basically improves upon the previous Note 5&#39;s design (and kept that important SD card) and doesn&#39;t go all-screen like the Note 8 did, nor did it have that strange aspect ratio.  This would have been the perfect primary phone for me...unfortunately the obscure Fan Edition is the only possibility to getting this one, which is nice but it&#39;s fairly limited."

the most explosive part of this video is his pronunciation of gif
Go away of that Phone its So danger betery can explode
Note 7 users be like “ALAHU AKBAR!”
Who&#39;s here after the discontinuation? Let me know by liking the comment
a good case for this is a bunch of nokia 3310s bolted together
Note 7 will always be the best❤️
"What Samsung thought they were making=📱<br><br>What they actually made=📟 (Ah well, closest thing to a bomb)"

"Note FE for 400$ in Saudi Arabia (1499 SAR),  shall I get it in 2018?"

RIP Legend! Such a nice design damn! Why the battery had to have so many problems.

"Anyone name of his pink wall paper at @<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m58s"">1:58</a> or where to get it?"
They made a Samsung fan edition which is a Samsung note 7 but doesn&#39;t explode
Anyone here following his Note Fan Edition video?
Note FE FTW
please make a review on the Note FE
what an epic fail by Samsung
cant wait for the note 8
they just released it again !
I give this phone a 9/11

who came here when galaxy fan edition announced
OMG I want to buy this phone but it&#39;s banned. Sighs What month will note8 be announced
"can&#39;t believe you actually got this phone, you got guts man, real good guts"
"finally this phone is back and its got a new name, Samsung galaxy note FE &quot;fan edition&quot;"
It&#39;s Great that they are coming back with it but I won&#39;t get nuts with what people are starting to do with the phone. I really would love to have again but I really don&#39;t like what people are pulling with price and availability so not cool.Hopefully down the road but like I said people are trying to take advantage. I wish I was smart enough to keep it and swap the battery out myself.Thanks for reminding me about this still think it was Awesome phone.Thanks MKB Appreciate it as always Deb👍✌️

Do skins prevent wireless charging?
Note 7 is the most beautiful phone i have ever seen...Even from the Galaxy S8
"I&#39;m just going to come out and say it. Despite the whole battery fiasco with the Nore 7, it could still be the best smartphone to date. It still has flagship specs, the bezels aren&#39;t stupid small resulting in better handling, palm rejection and durability, AND the fingerprint reader is on the front, in a good location. If Samsung can get DEX working with this then consider me sold!"
bring back this intro music. its awesom
a bomb 😱
note 8 will be too good
it&#39;s lit
"problem is, it is gonna explode and marques, i advise u to give it to ur ex"
it has fallen bait to some controversy because it was one of the best flagship phone ever made by Samsung
Should I upgrade to the S8 or keep the perfectly working Note?
"dbrand is now selling the skins (Note 7) for 99 dollars, no matter what section you want, even the camera cutout which is so tiny still costs the same.. They should have just stopped making dbrand skins for them, even though they have raised the price alot to convince people to not buy it and just return the phone, its still just stupid to still sell them for a phone which could catch on fire (logic)"
Apple users were so happy when they found out the note 7 battery had a chance to explode. <br>&quot;lol yas this is the perfect reason for us to hate on Samsung now xdxd&quot;
Samsung galaxy note s7
"At <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=2m01s"">2:01</a> it look like the s8"

"This was a really explosive review, it definitely heated up the phone market"
"Doubt Marquess is gonna see this comment since the video is so old but man, the video quality is amazing, HD to the max, but the echo on your voice is so noticeble"

why can&#39;t you buy them anymore if they were fixed?

Who is still watching this on Note 7

note 7 coming next month it&#39;s really bro tell
Went out with a bang.
galat
I&#39;m waiting for Note 7 FE to be on sale in Korea so that I can buy one &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 Next month!
is there anything better than this in market
"tbh i like the note bc of note taking. i like the feel of writing something down, bc its more natural and i dont like typing on a phone. i have an iphone, and when steve jobs insulted the use of a stylus, which then apple made a stylus, I was a lil shook. I like taking short notes on my arm and doodling junk, so why not on my phone, eh? tbh again, the iphone is not the worst, as long as you buy a generation or two back from the latest, cuz iphones are expensive af. suggestions on what g-note?"
Am I the only one that doesn&#39;t mind the fingerprints
"Samsung going to have that wierd 18.5:9 aspect ratio for Note 8 with the curved screen. Video watching will suck, a lot of unused screen because most videos are in 16:9. I use the Galaxy Note phones for watching Tv Shows, YouTube and movies."
$800+ for Note 7?? Thats alot of money to pay for an electronic grenade.
This phone sounds like the bomb!
Why are you watching this when you can&#39;t even get one 😂😂


sounds like the note 7 is really hot right now
lol

"Mannn.... I remember when Samsung first started coming out with the Galaxy/Note line (back when each carrier had a different name for the phone) they would not even care if you rooted or unlocked the bootloader. They were the most developer friendly devices at the time and every power user loved them for that reason. Wow has that stance ever changed.Still an awesome line and this phone is a beast, I just wish I could have vanilla android on it with quick updates."

Hey what&#39;s up MKBHD. Great Great  tech info. I&#39;m always on your YouTube site  I also agree a lot with your opinions. spreading the love per Michael Fisher. keep it up up up
I still come every now and then to. Watch this and hoping someday samaung will resell this beast cause i wi sti buy it even though its 2017 and a lot of flagship have already been released...
Really you are making great reviews.I really like them. I like the note 7 but however it explodes 😳. Should have been the best phone of 2016.Really the explanation you did very good.
The only thing more fire than the Note 7 was the quality of this video. Great video man. Keep it up!
<b>ahem</b> just correct this..its IP68 certified not IP67...clearly shows his mind revolves between iphones..
So glad Samsung is re releasing this phone again!
Roses are redViolets are blueMy name is jaffar I come from afarI have a note 7 in my carAllauakbar!!
Compare the curved screens on the Note 7 and on the S8. They are much more beautiful on the Note 7 than on the S8. And those rounded screen corners on the S8 are not as appealing as the square screen corners on the Note 7. IMO.
It&#39;s an explosive hit!
....<br> and then it exploded....
It&#39;s not ip67 its ip68
S7 edge is just a smaller Note 7.
2017 rip.............

"hi MKBHD, i wanna ask u whether i can order note 7 ? coz basically after the incident happend (explode) , the note 7 has stop selling in Malaysia and i also heard rumours saying that note 7 will come out again by this yr. so now im a lil confuse. So which 1 is true? can order the note 7 from US or wait till the note 7 will come out by this (that if its true) ?"

"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m17s"">7:17</a> wtf"
"I hope they release this phone again with an updated processor, fix the entire battery issue and improved camera.<br><br>I don&#39;t want that bullshit new screen they&#39;ve put on the S8 and the missing home button alongside that retarded fingerprint scanner at the back."
review about nokia 6 too
Now imagine if Samsung never had an exploding battery problem for the note 7
All those Apple sheep fanboy strikes... Still this was the best phone of 2016.. So fuck of ishit peoples...

what if it blew up when he was reviewing it
They should&#39;ve made it like explode proof and just release it again
buying a new phone.. and i just cant find one that is as prfect as this one... i really am sad it has batery problems.. this phone was gold.
I miss you note 7!!!
🔥💥bang
see. it was karma for them wanting to skip the number 6 and put it as the same as the galaxy s7 and edge
"Ok, I&#39;m gonna clue you in to how to say Gif marques.  Its a hard G because its an acronym for Graphic Interchange Format"
What u think of the refurbished note 7s
"All jokes aside about the battery explosion, this phone was great."
Does anyone know what that purple city wallpaper he was using was?
One of the best phones minus the explosions. I hate the samsung removed the physical button :(

I heard having a note 7 is a blast


So many explosion jokes

honestly I&#39;d take the risk of it exploding. it&#39;s a great phone

i still use mine and i have no problems
the note 7 was really fire
The problem that I&#39;ve ever had with Samsung is their version of Android.  I don&#39;t know why but I genuinely hate it.  But I recently got the google pixel and I absolutely love everything about that phone.


"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m42s"">5:42</a> you don&#39;t pronounce GIF like that"

that eye thing is dumb because you could be like kidnapped and someone you make you look at your phone and then now the phone unlocks and they have access to your phone now
Hmmmm. Mind-blowing. 😂 Terrible pun. I know.

This guy wearing fake tan or just has a skin problem...either way it annoys me
Is it safe to buy the note 7 now?
Its a grenade
Where did you get your shirt? It looks cool!
no headphone jack! no wireless charging! no HD resolution! no no no no!!!! but all an apple eater can say is &quot;at least it doesn&#39;t explode.&quot; yea it just sort of dies from lack of innovation. S7/Note 7 still a better phone. and the 8 series is gonna be &quot;explosive&quot; as well! haters.
god I miss this phone sooooooo much 😭😭😭😭
Will there be a galaxy note 8?
where can I oder a note 7 online I normally use eBay to buy my phones but I can&#39;t find any anywhere does someone knows a site that sells them

Haters overuse the battery joke because they know it&#39;s the only fault they can capitalize on.
forever in our hearts
I wonder if they gonna make a note 8!!??
anyone one notice he took photos on a plane with the note 7..............

I wanted this phone so bad
stupid question&gt;&gt;(but i dont know) will it be copy-right when you press the record button with the pen
Why buy a note 7 when you could just put a note 7 custom rom on your note 3?

I bet this was a great phone... Until you actually needed to use the damn thing
This video makes me sad because we now live in a world without the Galaxy Note 7 (I ended up getting S7 Edge instead)
Easily the most explosive smartphone to hit the market.
did he say jif?
I always turn up the volume in the intro
I dont like Samsungs backsides now. Fingerprint magnets :)
"Main thing I learned from this video, gif is pronounced jif."
if I just listened to the video and didn&#39;t watch I would have thought you were white.
The Note7 is IP68 water risistance R.I.P

"hey marques , what are your thoughts on the Samsung&#39;s UI design and software for the latest phones.  how at par do you feel they are in comparison to stock Android ? I mean when we take oxygen os in the one plus series we can fairly understand that the software we see, is what is as close to stock Android as possible .Plus the nifty features in there make the UI all the more better. Thoughts on the Samsung&#39;s design and what they should be improving ?"

wow your hand is so big!!!
Does anyone still have a Note 7? I would be interested in obtaining one for research. I will pay shipping and a small amount of money if needed but under $100. Its not like you can sell it anywhere else if its not returnable to Samsung! PM me!
Bullshit! this is one of the reason why I didn&#39;t finish my rig :( due to the DDR4 rams price tag! btw I watching this on my note 3 now ^_^
R.i.p dooo dooo do dooo doooo do doooo (dramatic music)
hell yeah  i would  get that phone  its clean ass fuck i think  is worth getting
Jiff? Jeff? JIFF?!
When will you do the iPhone 7 review?

yo so can we order the phone then if it has the good battery?
no not 100 phone
I&#39;m using the note 7 and it&#39;s great! What&#39;s that smell? Wait a seco-
man I&#39;m so sad it got cancelled it was the bomb.. literally



Sigh. It got discontinued.. Really wanted this phone..  Hope samsung launches a new model next year





IP68.. not 67
"if i find the chance to buy one of these online or through someone, should i get it? it&#39;s such a great phone. idc about the explosion thing bc there were only a few reports within the million that were being sold... so i see a low chance of it exploding on me, and i&#39;ll risk it irdc. or is there a better phone than the note 7 that&#39;s out rn that i should get?"
The display just looks too fake to me. I&#39;ll stick with my 6s
Whos watching in 2018
All these youtubers wasted a good 20 mins of talking but we have memories

when are they gonna come out with the replacement or are we gonna have to wait until the note 8?

the next note must have removable battery for crying out loud. A battery replacement would have saved this device

Samsung is horse shit
"danm, it looks so good, wish they hadn&#39;t fudged it up"
This review is very explosive :D
i still have mine fully sealed
No matter how good the display may become in Samsung phones - I will never ever buy a device with a branding on its front. This is a complete dealbreaker on all levels.
Got sent home from school for bringing in my Note 7.. TBH i think they blew it up out of proportion
risking ur life.! Just for the sake of ur followers..SuperHero ur🤘
I love how the media won&#39;t cover the iPhone 7 phone explosions at all. Weird.
I still use my note 7 :P

"Now that Samsung stop selling these Note 7, idk if I really want to switch to Android, more specific, Samsung. Still owning a IPhone 5s. Might as well wait for S8 and if they do make one, Note 8. Looking forward to the quad core new processor that&#39;s being rumored. But I hope they will fix battery issues, other wise I&#39;m stuck with an IPhone."
Gold Bible dinner kewgaen star.
"I will be VERY upset with Samsung if they don&#39;t keep the Note name. Just because the last Note had a catastrophic battery issue, does not mean the rest of the Note 7 wasn&#39;t great. The previous 5 generations of Note devices earned great reputation. 1 bad iteration out of the 6 produced, should be more than enough to keep the line going. Every time Apple has a problem with an iPhone, you don&#39;t see them changing the name to something else. You have to fix the problem, instead of sweeping it under the rug."

Samsung mobile have absolutely fucked themselves now. People switching to iPhone left and right as they should.

R.I.P. Note 7


What do you recommend as a good replacement for the N7?  I am a fan of the pen and screen size but not the edge screen.  I am considering the Pixel but have no experience with stock Android.

All I want to know is there a note 8 coming? Because I&#39;ve read that Samsung is pulling the plug on the note line all together. TBH  galaxy note phones are the only phones which interested me.













they need to bring the side bar from the note 4 edge..... it made use of the edge and these new edge phones aren&#39;t taking advantage of something that can be a great selling point.
This phone is ip68water and dust ressistant

Never buy Korean.
Why is he confused between jif &amp; gif
rest in pieces note 7 you shall be missed haha dang

I&#39;ll still get it
I love this phone but I hate it... I just hate it cuz it&#39;s Samsung
Can&#39;t wait the price on this to drop gonna get one asap.
"No more note 7, Samsung said they will discontinue it.😢"
I thought it was illegal to carry a bomb
ehhh i still think the iphone 7 plus is way better then the note 7 well was the note 7
holy shit its beautiful
Best feature: Built-in flamethrower.
When did it get to version 7?<br><br>I had a Note 2 when it first came out not that long ago.<br><br>Are they releasing two per year or something?
Samsung will stop skipping numbers from now on
Well...The Note 7 is officially dead. Samsung is completely and permanently discontinuing it since even the replacement Note 7s are also exploding. The Galaxy Note line of Samsung phones are pretty much  dead....Death Note...
This phone is already dead.

RIP Note 7 2016-2016 <br>-from a Note 5 user
the iris scan came around first with the lumia 950 shame windows phone isnt popular
hey MKBHD which is your daily driver now after the note 7 debacle?
What do with the RIP? :( I&#39;m lost... I&#39;m alone.... I&#39;m dramatic.
where can I buy one of these?
"Hi guys! So I was planning on getting the Note 7, but sad things happened with the cease in production and selling. I am thinking of getting an LG V20 or a Pixel XL right now since they&#39;re quite the latest bunch (and I do not regularly buy new phones, it&#39;ll be better for me to buy the latest models) but I am also looking back into the Note 5 if it&#39;ll do. Actually the S-Pen is a great deal for me, I really want it but I am hesitant that the hardware may get dated about now. Any tips? Thanks in advance!<br><br>Edit: the Note 5 here is quite cheaper compared to the (supposed) price of the incoming LG V20 and Pixel XL here by about a third. I&#39;m thinking of getting the Note 5 now and wait for the next note then."
"This is the best phone to date, not the silly V20 or the ugly Pixels"
RIP
RIP Galaxy Note 7 2016-2016<br><br>There&#39;s no point in watching this since you can&#39;t even buy the phone now :P

Still blowing up lol

R.I.P note 7 (2016-2016). my note 5 is still running smoothly btw.

Even the new ones are still exploding and Samsung has completely stopped production and issued a second recall.
Heard the Samsung note 7 is a blast to use... literally!
that phones dead nw.. so sad to hear..
The first smartphone that doubles as a grenade. James Bond would be proud.





















I have the Note 7 and I&#39;m keeping it. Has everything I need including the exploding  feature for that zombie apocalypse. A phone and a weapon! Beat that Apple. Plus this is a first in cell phone history.. &quot;The exploding phone&quot; lol. power down and buy the edge...
"RIP Weapon 7 , you will be missed. NOT."
"hahahhaha @Marques, a phone stand made of ear-pods, jokes!"
That green battery icon means it will explode faster than the older one
boom！
"I&#39;d love to buy this phone in about 1,5-2 years when its price drops to ~400$ if they actually fix the battery problem once and for all."
Can you tell me where you got that shirt

"Setting the battery issues aside, this was by far the best phone in the world performance and features wise"
Isis rigged samsungs devices because they want Apple to be the primary cell phone people have because they know Apple wont hack their phones.
"Whenever he&#39;s reviewing an Android phone, MKBHD always says &quot;The specs of this phone are blah blah blah PROCESSOR. Blah blah blah RAM and blah blah blah highest specs!&quot; LoL.. and he never mentions that the iPhone destroys every single android phone on the market in benchmark tests. Specs dont mean shit."
Galaxy Note 7 is the Harambe of smartphones :(
Recalled indefinitely. Buyer beware..
Well this didn&#39;t last long on the market. Did yours ever go supernova in the vast galaxy that is your personal space? :P
how do you like the bomb phone?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m05s"">5:05</a> anyone have the wallpaper?"
Rip note 7 2016-2016
"Seriously ,who made the Note 7? ISIS?"
hey Marquez you keeping your note 7 or returning it
@mkbhd
disappointed that mkbhd has not left a comment on the continuing explosion problems... still problems as of oct 11 2016
Bunch of Apple whinny bitch writers killed this phone.  You can&#39;t take a couple 3rd degree burns on your leg or breathe in a little toxic gas?   This generation bunch of wussies.
Great fucking phone. Samsung knew it would destroy apples iPhone 7 but its a shame it had problems.








RIP note 7
Wonder what is next?
Yep it is gone!
Is anyone else dying?
As I&#39;m sure you heard about the 2nd recall. Many ppl are considering keeping it. What would you consider getting next to the note 7 besides the edge? I really wanna know you&#39;re thoughts about this &amp; any advice you can throw out there for us note 7 ppl. or previous per say. would love to see a update video bc its an all around hot mess. Great job on everything Marcus!
"Best phone of the year easily, sad because a 3rd party battery company fucked samsung over"
And.. now it&#39;s gone.
Maybe the phone had an identity crisis since it expected to be called the Note 6.  It couldn&#39;t handle the error.
So what would be a decent alternative to this bomb?
Green battery aaaaahh!!! Watch out dude
Aaand it&#39;s gone from market....
Rip
Screens great but sadly it fucking blows up
RIP in Peace NOTE 7!!! We will remember you :&#39;( :&#39;( :&#39;(

"This just in: Note 7 discontinued. Suck it, SamSkunk fanbois."
Only a fool would walk around with a ticking time bomb in their pocket.
I guess YouTube&#39;s top reviewers will stop referring this phone now. 😒
This video became extremely irrelevant. Rip note 7. The best almost-had-phone I never had.
We lost Harambe now we lose the Note 7 why 2016 :(
FUCCKKKK I WAS LOOKING FOWARD TO GETTING IT WHY DID THEY STOP PRODUCTION ://////
the edges look like the iphone lol
"They are all exploding now.  Samsung has killed off this model- no replacements, you&#39;ll have to pick something else."
I`m keeping mine going to see if I can swap the battery out
RIP Samsung Galaxy Note 7<br><br>2016-2016
LOL
Still using Note 7.  Dont&#39; give a fvck!  Come at me bro.
RIP SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 7 (2016-2016)
What a good phone it was....you&#39;ll be missed Note 7
it&#39;s still exploding anyways...
That phone was FIREE
This phone is the bomb :)
The note 7 is officially discontinued.









bet he feels a bit silly now!
I think you are the best tech reviewer on youtube- your videos are excelent!<br>But just one thing:  <br>I have owned an android and an iphone. The experience of the iphone was a lot more satisfying for me. (the android gets annoyingly slow after a year. But I still use my iphone 5s with the iOS 10.) My android phone was Moto atrix- and also a samsung galaxy S4. On the S4 it takes 4 seconds to take a picture!- that is how slow it is. <br><br>What I am saying is that I think you should account for the fact that android phones do not keep up with the updates and they will be a lot slower after some time than an iphone for any reason cause someone like me plan to keep the phone for a year or two.
If the note 7 had a removable battery samsung could have just replaced it rather then the entire phone. Get an Lg G5 its a brilliant phone
"Just ordered a new Note7 on the day my carrier discontinued it.  I had to search to find it bc it didn&#39;t show up as an offered replacement.  UPS says it will come tomorrow morning.  I&#39;m proud to get it.  I&#39;ll turn off fast charging and I have taken precautions in case it does catch fire / explode but after a month or two I&#39;ll trust it.  I&#39;ll definitely check it our when I get it (green battery ind., made in China, etc). But if it all checks out I&#39;ll be ecstatic.  It&#39;s the phone I&#39;ve always wanted ... a waterproof, drop-resistant note with QI charging and an outdoor-capable display."
Has it blew up yet lol
so that&#39;s why they not using usb type c till now
"This was a beautiful phone, just a shame that it had battery problems. Luckily, they will release like 5-6 main devices next year so the S8 may be the best! At least they did the right thing"
"Not being funny here, it would not surprise me if Samsung was made a target by some other competitor, won&#39;t say any names cause I don&#39;t want my arse sued, but it would be easy for another competitor to put a plant in the note 7 production line to contaminate the  battery with the wrong material ....say no more...<br>Apart from who benefiting from Samsungs note 7 being stopped permanently in production ....bitter lemon is not nice lol...yeh I&#39;m jive talkin."
Why are you not talking about the overheating/exploding issue??
"Apple could&#39;ve produced the iPhone 8 THIS year if they had rushed it like Samsung does with their phones, but Apple doesn&#39;t like their phones to explode."
iPhone wins because it doesn&#39;t explode.
Step1: Bring multiple note 7&#39;s on an airplane.<br>Step2: Play games on them until the phone starts to over heat.<br>Step3:Bust open the windows while screaming Allahu Akbar<br>Step4: chuck them at the engines of the airplane.<br>Step5:..................................................................................................

I guess this phone is now a collectors item.
why do you continue to compare this to the S7 why don&#39;t you compared to the Note 5 it is a note isn&#39;t it
What&#39;s your opinion about Note7&#39;s worldwide recall and ending production of this amazing phone?
Wow that is so hot.
This phone is hot!!!
Boom!!!! 😈
This is the best phone in the US currently.

Discontinued permanently? Guess I should buy one for collection.
This phone has just been permanently discontinued due to replacements exploding too. Maybe put a disclaimer at the end of your video saying DO NOT buy these.

Who came here after the note 7 got discontinued





































Soo... the phone is off the market now
"The phone is recalled, being pulled off the market and is out of production.  The Galaxy Note 7 is toast (in more ways than one)."
The Ford Pinto of phones 😆
"&quot;Get the green battery&quot; turns out just a wishful thinking. Now the flagship is history, and the brand image is in danger."
UP IN FLAMES!
watching this on my note se-
Yesterday Samsung officially stated that Galaxy Note 7 is over and they won&#39;t release it anymore ... if you have this phone go to store and return it
"The phone is water resitant....<br>So... wait till the fire is big, before that water won t help."
"Review?<br>If the phone not burns, he can do the job very good."
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=9m34s"">9:34</a> &quot;now we are good?&quot;  are you sure Marques? The other day a fixed Note 7 caught fire on a plane, which had to be evacuated. And today Samsung says to switch them off. Final nail on the coffin for Note 7 I think. No wonder it&#39;s got 2016&#39;s Shonky Award in Australia.<br><a href=""https://www.choice.com.au/shonky-awards/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2016/samsung"">https://www.choice.com.au/shonky-awards/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2016/samsung</a>"
BOOM SHAKALA!
Anddddd it&#39;s discontinued......
good
good
The replacement still explodes. The phone is Officially DEAD. R I P
You keep mentioning and overating the short term benefits of every Samsung. Too overbiased for me


Samsung &quot;on top of the build quality game&quot; 😂😂😂 sure it is
Note 7 has been officially recalled. Again. Return it ASAP before you die in a fire 🔥
SHUT IT DOWN.SHUT IT DOWN. SHUT IT DOWN. THIS IS A SOUTH KOREA MINI BOMB!! NOT A CELLPHONE!!
Now it&#39;s discontinued. Should have stuck with an iPhone ;)
Sounds like a blast
















well RIP. its officially out of production now
your video ended early.
RIP
You forgot the problem where it explodes or catches fire... CNN: Samsung tells users: Turn off your Galaxy Note 7 phone NOW!! Look it up
"⚠️WARNING: The replaced note 7 have also been recalled, since they too have started exploding/catching fire ⚠️"
he lost me at &quot;jif&quot; xD
the burnt phones were illegally rooted by the hackers
"Potentially faced with a second recall, now what?! I&#39;m just not interested in any of the other available phones. Help!"


The self-detonation feature is useful when you want to erase your data .. Samsung is really ahead of the pack with this one ..
guess what the new version explode too! basically reviewing a hand grenade
rip
rip Note7
ISIS is using the note 7 as detonators.
This phone is now dead...kaboom

So now that all major carriers are ceasing the sales of the phone due to explosive issues.  What&#39;s your alternative suggestion the next best option? Are you going to be hanging on to yours?
Ok so the best phone is now officially Dead! What next? What would you suggest as a good replace.
note 7 the phone you return after you enjoy it for a month
its discounted return it
"Marques, do you still using it as your daily driver? Ines from Argentina"
It&#39;s hard to find phone reveiw videos that I like. You have a great voice and you&#39;re right to the point which I love. I think this is the first phone review video that I liked 100%. You&#39;re awesome! I own a Note 7 and so far so good! The battery life is amazing and the camera is good too! 고마워요!
The replacement still explodes. You may want to update this review.
"Its a shame the battery had problems, cus this is a beautiful phone"
















Even the replacements are blowing up Lmfao
Best phone ever... appart from the explosions.

He didn&#39;t mention how they can prevent an aircraft full of passengers from taking off. It&#39;s a fantastic addition to the range.
Android still suck tho

@marques i think they need to add facetime
"what is that Google widget at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m12s"">5:12</a>? anybody???"
Why still no LG G5 review?

"I wanted a note 7 for Christmas this year, my dad said yes at first (even after reports of them catching on fire) but sense they updated and are still catching fire, I&#39;m not aloud to have one. I feel so bad for Samsung! It&#39;s a beautiful phone. Such a shame. He says it&#39;s not safe enough for me (btw he is a tech guy and was about to buy one for himself too lol)"







"Hey Marques, I&#39;m interested to hear what you think about the replacement Note 7&#39;s catching fire. I&#39;m considering returning mine and going for the Pixel phone."
iPhone 7 Plus or this?
The replacements are exploding. Maybe a third time will be a charm.

24 hours later goodbye new bed

I&#39;m trading in my 6 plus early and paying extra just to get this phone. I should have never switched to Apple

So far 1 replacement Note 7 has exploded



Hey Marques! Would you still recommend this phone in light of the recent events? I&#39;m really considering getting one. Are you having issues with the battery life?
is the note7 still worth buying given all the drama and issue it brings along with it?







You should say this is a Samsung Grenade.
Samsung please don&#39;t buy they are not a good cell phone maker no more goggle has xl.pixel is much better and 300 cheaper and has more features please don&#39;t waste your money on Samsung HTC LG Samsung your done

This review was a BLOWOUT
"The exploding phone made it more sexy because its a hot phone packed with the best tech in any phone. I purchased my coral blue recently with the green battery and when i pull out my note 7, I can feel a disturbance in the force by envious people!!!"
"How about you review dbrand again, because the new iphone 7 skin, sucks big time!!! doens&#39;t stick and doesn&#39;t fit at all. especially the bottom part for the speakers!! the worst development!!!"
&quot;Into JIF you can share&quot; *Dies a little&quot;
"the NOTE 7 is probably the best phone ever created lol , its so hot... it is explosive!!"






it is ip68 not ip67
doesn&#39;t the s6 have 16mp??

apple fan be making fun of this exploding issue. guess what... Samsung can fix that really easy but you can&#39;t still charge your iPhone 7 and listen to music at the same time
who came here just to comment about the explosions
"couple of days ago note 7 started ti heat up when the user turned it off on a plane. the phone got so hot it burned the plain carpet on the floor. if the phone can kill you, you stay away from it. bad job Samsung."
"I&#39;m raising money for :( NEED Samsung Galaxy Note7. Click to Donate:  <a href=""https://gofund.me/2t9juw4c"">https://gofund.me/2t9juw4c</a>?"
"So I have a Note 7 being delivered on monday, and I ordered BEFORE I&#39;d heard of another incident of one overheating on a SW airlines flight.

"So yeah, there was that Southwest (replaced)Note 7 explosion thing<br>Is the Note 7 still worth the risk?"
"I saw a deluxe package, lol, if you buy a note 7 u get 20% of of a fire extinguisher..."
Do a A9 Pro plz
That ball of earpods haha :D
&quot;It has a headphone jack... of course.&quot; Oh the shade.

There was an explosion of a powered off replacement phone in an airplane. =/
Good
It&#39;s ip68 not ip67. But great review!
Before long noone will be able to use Note 7s in public facilities because of no smoking laws!

Apple is already history shit phones they going down every 3 month &amp;<br> Samsung just half plastic glass cheap made with no quality control <br>phones  both apple and samsung copy each other and copy so much from huawei<br> even the dual cameras. Huawei will lead soon they already no3 worldwide specially high <br>phones no one can come close to them in quality and design specs
JIF!
I honestly want this phone but the replacements are also exploding. I have an iPhone 6 should I upgrade to the 7 or switch to the s7 edge?

Note 7 did it again! It is not good to recommend dangerous devices in your reviews.

"Changed your Note 7 to a new one? Doesn&#39;t matter, still explodes."
"Thirty-five Marques, lol."
I hate that different phones have features that others don&#39;t have. just make one good phone

Thank you for your reviews. You make the decision making process much easier! 👍
Im sure you&#39;ve been asked this before but is there a time period on how long you keep the phones before &amp;&amp; after the review or do you own it yourself.?

Your T-shirt 😍
It&#39;s GIF with a hard G. Graphics Interchange Format. G-IF. GIF.




















Knife remember emotional construction
Anyone knows where i can download GraceUI/UX for my S5 Neo?
"Yeah, it&#39;s laggy and slow."
Is that the one that explodes 💣
So many people making jokes about the phone that clearly didn&#39;t watch the end of the video
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m17s"">7:17</a> wtf. ball of earpods. that&#39;s gotta be like a $500 video prop."



what will you chose between s7edge and note7
GREAT LINE OF PHONES
Isn&#39;t that the phone that tries to kill you?
















Still dumb phone which can&#39;t use bluetooth headset as a video mic.
has your Galaxy Note  7 exploded since you bought it?
Have you used Samsung pay? If so how well does it work with non tap to pay terminals ie. Mst technology?
its pronounced gif! like gift w/o the t.
i need that wallpaper he uses
White battery scary.
"So why shouldn&#39;t I get a S7 Edge and buy a pen for 5$, instead spending like 200$+ to basically get an s7 edge + pen"
should I get the note 7 or the 7 edge??







nice tee tho
"if it&#39;s lagging at stock right now, can imagine when the phones got a thousand pics, some vids and game apps in, my galaxy s5 sport does nothing but lag now :("
that T-shirt is literally one of the best ones I&#39;ve seen !
Just picked up my note 7 this past weekend and I am obsessed.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
even though what happens. salute you Samsung!
Curve edge sucks period
"How to rob a bank. You bring 10 of this phone attach it to the safe heat it up and BADABOOM. Wait, no BIG BADABOOM. Still  cheaper than regular explosives. YES, IPHONE FANBOY HERE SO WHAT..."
"i have actually been getting really great battery life with my no boom note 7. i have noticed that the always on display uses more than what they said it would, so i leave it off most of the time. the note 7 is pretty much the same battery life as my s7 edge, however, it did take about a week for the battery to settle in and really show how good it is."
"This video is sponsored by Samsung Note 7!!! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23explosive"">#explosive</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ad"">#ad</a>"
"The Note 7 is actually IP68 water resistant. You said its IP67, maybe you got it confused with the iPhone 7? :)"
IP68*
"what game was he playing at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m42s"">1:42</a>?"
Are you going to make a review on the lenovo yoga book?
Great review. Only gripe is the fact that you said &quot;Jif&quot;





















you can say that this phone is the bomb of smartphones
"I&#39;ve heard that Apple is getting $4 for every headphone manufactured<br>with a lightning jack, because apparently they patented it. Imagine how<br>many brands are there making headphones?<br>Now tell me, did mother Earth ask for money when they used the apple (fruit)<br>as a logo?<br><br>Apple is greedy."
"I hope S8 will come with the same Audio feature + audiojack<br>Better they ditch fingerprint scanner with raise to wake+iris scan feature, I mean the phone is waterresist yet fingerprint scanner don&#39;t work while wet"
Dat Quality!
How do I get rid of the bloat ware and should I get rid of all of them.. Note 7.. Thanks
I&#39;m surprised that it didn&#39;t blow up in your hand.
but theres still explosion cases after getting green battery unit
how hot it will be when heavy using..... curiosity ..... thank x mate!
I like your t-shirt!!! Where&#39;d you buy that? :D
"@ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m31s"">7:31</a> It&#39;s IP68 certified, not IP67. The iPhone 7 is IP67."
Bonus- could be used as a grenade
That wad of ear pods as a stand haha
Love this phone!
"After having used this phone, the s7 edge and the 7 plus I have to say the smoothest user experience is the iPhone. But what&#39;s new?"
WHY SO SERIOUS?
"Turns out that the display was so sharp , it cut an atom in 2 ."
"MKBHD soon died while having this as his last daily driver , R.I.P"
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=4m57s"">4:57</a> austin lol"
hey +Marques Brownlee you want to send me some of those apple headphones right quick? 😂😂😂
this review blew me away
"Man, that phone is da bomb..."
Apple fans are saying at least it didn&#39;t explode well at least the phone has a headphone jack
No! I love this guy! I don&#39;t want him to explode!














Did you change out from the recall? Did blowup on you?

your hands make the biggest phone look like the smallest phone lmao
I wonder which phone he personally uses! He&#39;s good :)
"Have the Priv now, since BB is not making their own phones and I guess it will take some time for a good BB outsorced phone to come out, the Note7, maybe 8 by then, is my option, love that phone, love the video"
Should I get the S7 or V20?
I will never be a IPhone user. They sucks serious ass.
Im glad u didn&#39;t blow up
Review the B&amp;O H7 Wireless Headphones!! Wondering whether they could compete with the Bose QC35s.
It&#39;s pretty good phone thank you for the great review! I&#39;m probably going to wait for S8 since it hopefully brings something new (maybe even a little different design?)
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m20s"">7:20</a> WTF 😂😂😂"
That EarPods ball though ahahah
The dbrand skin comes off from the sides very easily....any tips to prevent?



there was a news that even the Note7 from the new batch exploded...
"Edge to edge display is such a failure, I don&#39;t know why this is being downplayed"

Good review...always respect your reviews as you cover a lot but very quickly. I&#39;m hoping you do a review on the LG V20 as it&#39;s coming down to these two for me (and many other folks too). Keep up the amazing work!
Im just sayin this but he really looks like the guy from incredibox
"The Note7 is actually IP-68 water resistant, you said IP-67"









The Samsung battery explosions was Apple industrial espionage! I Cant prove it... but since when cant samsung make a battery???

I love tech but I eat ramen noodles for dinner
not gonna lie.. im a apple guy but i really want this phone just for sketching since im a architect major. think it would be really helpful. any thoughts? and any other helpful tips this phone may help with.




Man with steel balls. He is using goddamn note 7




"need a video for xperia xz , that 5 axis stabilization."
Thanks for the review. Thinking about upgrading mi note 4 but I am a bit tempted by the pixel XL. Hope to see a review soon to decide.
what is with the smoke
does it have a 4k display
it&#39;s. ip 68 not ip 67

"Do Samsung Galaxy J7, please :)"
dude the best camera is on Nokia lumia that huge camera.


unsubscribed

This guy has become a sell out.


where to download the wallpapers from om your note 7?
"MKBHDbrands, I&#39;ll leave a link down below"
"You are &quot;holding it wrong&quot;. Yep. Just, you know...the way a human&#39;s hand naturally holds it makes the touch screen unresponsive. Ya, our fault Samsung."
"just love the design and the  camera , still the best !"
ip68 water resistant
Does the note 7 have gyroscope sensor?
"Sounds like an awesome phone if it doesn&#39;t explode on you.... Rather wait for their rebound effort, the s8 with a snapdragon 821 processor coming out early next year"




Who needs a device explodes and burn in
mkb can u please share a link for the joker  t-shirts u r wearing please
"His shirt is so sick, does anyone know where he got it?"
Posting this comment from my new note 7. love it. just got it today and I can say I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t jump to an iPhone 7 plus because I was being impatient.
Out of the box question but which one is better? UBUNTU or WINDOWS.
qhd doesn&#39;t matter when most videos&amp;media are in 1080p right?






Any plans to review the Honor 8?
BE CAREFUL MARQUES! Who will I reference for all the latest tech if you blow up?? :((!!
"How much storage on a micro SD card does this take? I got a 64gb phone, but have a 64gb sd card and am thinking of getting a 128gb sd card or a 200 gb sd card."
"I always hear at the beginning, ohhhh a a a rubber ducky"
"Dude, please talk about, and compare the not 7 with the noteb5, and what is differant from it."
ip68*
"Am I the only one who doesn&#39;t see much of an upgrade from the previous model? Design looks very similar, slightly upgraded specs, same camera as GS7 and the typical added gimmicks. Oh and I can&#39;t forgot it explodes."

"Not when it costs $250 to manufacture, I don&#39;t think is worth $800 - $1000 depending on country"
Did he say IP67? I&#39;m sure it&#39;s IP68 now Marcus.... Thanks 😈
You have great taste for shirts!
lg v20&#39;s processer and camera about to wreck the note 7
do you guys know what theme does he use?
Disaster struck when Americans started buying Korean stuff and driving Japanese cars...
love your reviews!
Looks nice but can&#39;t stand Android UI and apps.
It&#39;s so amazing how a video about a Samsung product is full of iPhone comments! <br>That&#39;s a testament to Apple&#39;s marketing team since no publicity is bad publicity.
i bought iph 7 yesterday n i have porsche p9983 this  sucks in front of those 2 bahimas iphone 7 is awesome n porsche is elite class
"your t-shirt design is great, i like all your t-shirt collection. where you get it man, most of t-shirt are manufactured in INDIA, but i couldn&#39;t find one here"
Best in class display excellent!  Best in class explosions Damm it I wanted this phone
Also they were phones bought before Sept 10th!!
why does it seem like the audio is delayed im using the YouTube app I have a 7edge
would have expected a snapdragon 821 :/
bro. Jif? cmon. I&#39;d expect more out of a fellow turbo-nerd
love my safe note7 ❤
I personally like the &quot;BOOM&quot;sound on the Note7





IP68
Ball of apple earpods. Awesome.
Does this phone really blast

Bomb review
its basically the same review of the note 5 + explosions
"hey, where did u get tht red wallpaper uve used on the OnePlus 3? and cn u do a vid abt what&#39;s on ur smartphone?"

Is this the exploding version or the non exploding one ?
good review
Exploding phone or not Samsung has the best phone out there hands down!
Did he say Jif.
"Why the fack people hit the dislike button for?! This guy is the first afro-american who got the right mix for tech reviews and he&#39;s really useful, always has a different angle from the other good reviewers, which is useful don&#39;t you think?"
where can i find this wallpaper in galaxy note 7
nice
This review better be explosive.

&quot;It has USB type C--which I like...and a headphone jack--of course.&quot;~ No iPhone 7 user ever
b careful  the now ones have started to explode
what&#39;s going on with the Droid Turbo 3?
"Amazing phone, but would be even better with a removable battery."
That was one extreme review. Got blown away by the quality
You got super black hands
i like the Spen very much. im just waiting for another 3 months to hear more feed backs and reviews about the battery.
The bottom seems like a copy of iPhone?
a 100? LOL When did that happen?
I wish this phone was compatible with Google project fi.
it wastes money
Those Adam speakers though ayee
"&quot;JIF&quot; is peanut butter, don&#39;t say &quot;JIF&quot;, say &quot;gif&quot;."
what game is he playing at 1.41?
"Many photos u took, are not in focus..."
Best Phone!!!
"All Apple fanboys making exploding jokes...iPhone&#39;s have been exploded before too!  Though not a common occurrence, there are reports."
has the battery been fixed ??
you make the phone look so small
It&#39;s IP68 rated not IP67 rated :/
It&#39;s IP68 rated not IP67 rated :/
I like the shirt could you link that? Thanks
DID HE SAY JIF ?????
I&#39;m ready to upgrade my Note 4 to a Note 7 but I&#39;m thinking Sammy is going to offer a rebate to jump-start sales again. Make it $200 plus a 256GB MicroSD and I&#39;m there.
iphone is 67 note 7 is 68
"You blamed yourself for &quot;holding it wrong&quot; (i know) when it would not recognize your touch because your palm was touching this, but that&#39;s not your fault, that&#39;s poor design. iOS has really good palm rejection, and even if your hand is rested on it, it remains responsive to the other hand. This should do the same, ESPECIALLY since the display is edge-to-edge. Wouldn&#39;t you agree? Not sure if that&#39;s an Android problem or a TouchWiz problem."




You actually risked your life to deliver us this review...respect !
says &quot;Jif&quot;  That&#39;s where this review ends pleb.
I guess &quot;power user&quot; is just a nicer sounding term for &quot;heavy user&quot; but they&#39;re exactly the same.
Great video for an awesome phone!
I need that shirt
anyone know what locker hes using?
is note 7 available in stores ..?? <br>or we have to order..?? <br><br>plz tell me ..
PLEASE make a review on the Xiaomi mi book air 12.5 and 13.3 inches. PLEASE.

I&#39;ll always check in to see what you say about a phone before pulling the trigger. Good review.
Could you do something on the Xiaomi Mi5s? Looks like a pretty neat phone at a great price!
dat shirt.. amazing.
Anybody know when the phone will be released in the U.K.??
Did anyone Notice!! he was Actually using 110 mbps Internet Speed In Los Angles Calfornia.. I liked the Camera specially in galaxy Note S7 Great Phone..
Where did you get that shirt????
It&#39;s funny how phones sold in the USA has the carrier logo still on it. <br><br>Other countries don&#39;t have that crap.
Bro can yu pls make video on moto x 1st gen with lollipop update pls I am India
Tom Joyner just shouted you out.
"The new ones have worst battery life than the old one that it&#39;s replacing. It&#39;s rated the same 3500mah but the cells are smaller, so it drains faster and a lot of people complaining about overheating on those new phones as well. Once your note 7 is made in China those are the good ones, those have the atl batteries the ones made outside of China are the ones with the Sdi batteries which are exploding."
Loved it!
"Samsung Note 7  are banned in commercial flights and public transport !! <br><br>Officially the US govt and governments of other countries called for the ban of the Samsung device. <br><br>Question is , if I see someone still using them despite the ban .

Too late...... The hype is over

Am I the only one who noticed the apple earphone ball in this video?
Fam where&#39;s yo review if the new iPhones?
Did anyone else see that ball of earphones?

Crispy vid! SICK SHIRT!!!
Beware your hand from exploding. Love your hand.

Samking has done it again! Best phone of the year!
jif?
hold on a second... we&#39;re you Vaping to achieve that fake smoke effect? Lmao







ANYONE knows how much this phone will go for on BLACK FRIDAY??? or if it&#39;ll be available.
No People Were Harmed in the Making of This Video. lol !
"It&#39;s actually pronounced &quot;gif,&quot; not &quot;gif.&quot;"
Marques could you do a scratch test on the Note 7 and Note 5 Home buttons since there&#39;s been multiple reports on how easily scratched these home buttons Samsung uses?
Can anyone tell me the name of wallpaper which set on MKBHD&#39;s Note7?
I&#39;m really glad Samsung toned down the saturation of their photos. The camera on the Galaxy S7/S7 Edge/Note 7 is stellar.
"Solid work as always bro. I had the Note 7 with T-Mobile but I returned it. Now unfortunately, I&#39;m unable to upgrade until they exchange all the old users phones first. Kinda sucks I&#39;m last priority when I was an early adopter, but can&#39;t wait to get the new batch in a few weeks, or whenever that is."
this really is an awesome phone. I&#39;ve neglected my iPhone 7 so much since getting the note 7. I really love how easy it is to see the display even when it&#39;s sunny outside.
I want this so bad!!!😭
"Somebody , please tell me where I can get that SHIRT!!!"
Where did you get that shirt?
do a top 10 earphones in 2016..
Bring back removable batteriessssss
Yeah EXPLOSIONS !
This smartphone is a beatiful smartphone and in my opinion the best!
its funny how the Apple fanboys just use the &quot;at least my phone doesn&#39;t explode&quot; excuse on Samsung users.. like how does that make your phone better lmao that was just a mistake

That AT&amp;T carrier should be illegal.

Hi sir! i use my iphone for editing videos and im using imovie app. what is the best video editor for note 7? im planning to switch to note 7 if it has imovie-app-like application. Easy and fast. thanks!

&quot;Jif?&quot; It&#39;s GIF!!!!
how much is it for the note 7
"&quot;The Note 7 is the best phone Samsung makes right now, other than the only other phone they make right now....&quot; - MKBHD"
"Um, t-shirt link please?"
"One more thing: People should stop calling the issue with the Note 7&#39;s &quot;explosion&quot;. What it really did was catch fire on an extremely low fraction of the phones in the first shipments. Really a big difference here, wouldnt you agree? The term &quot;explosion&quot; just makes for a more flashy headline or catchphrase. The only problem here is that iit isn&#39;t true :)"
Great review with reliable feedback. Thanks for taking the time to convert me from Apple to Android!!!
It&#39;s not better than one plus 3 charge
"Great video! Just want to point out a little glitch: The phone is IP68, which is a lot better than IP67 mentioned in the vid. Fabolous phone."
"Damn... he had like 40 apps open at the same time and it was still smooth as fuck.<br>And about the explosion, didn&#39;t Samsung confirmed like 26 of the explosions to be fake (intentional)?"

Love the t-shirt MKBHD where is it from?
can you get us the wallpaper you used?
Any one knows where I can get his wallpaper. Love it!
frnd i want to know that how i choose between old note7 and new note7..
I have watched countless number of videos of Marques and I have fortunately never had anything bad to say about them. Though for the first time it felt as if am watching a commercial and not really an honest review.



"It&#39;s gif, not jif. Kappa"




About 30% of those &quot;explosions&quot; were fake.
your videos.... such quality... much wow!!
Did he just say&quot;JIF&quot;?! o_O
not even a good bye...:(

"Dope review as usual. Slightly off topic, but where did u get that shirt?"
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m36s"">3:36</a>., how was this allowed on a plane? I travelled about 4 times after this release and they announced Note 7 not allowed and I kind of agree due to the risk.<br>EDIT: Should have watched the whole video before typing."
review the  lg v20  plz!!!!

"Dat earpod ball @<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m20s"">7:20</a>. Must have!"
You forgot to mention the part where it blows up







"Was waiting for a Michael Bay type of ending, where everything just explodes."
You should probably start doing reviews on budget phones. There is competition and people want quality reviews! 
Anyone opened the video for the jokes?
Yes I&#39;m buying! &lt;3
T-shirt link? Please.
"in airplane, they ask to switch off note 7 lol"
I&#39;m a die hard Samsung note user... And I&#39;m still sceptical to upgrade from the 4 to the 7.
"Hey Marques, is that Furtif desk behind you? <br>If it is, could you please a make a video reviewing the desk ?"
"R u planning to have Note 7 and worried about how to transfer old phone data like Contacts,pictures,videos and more to new Note 7 without PC/Cables Try SmartIO App<br><br><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartio&amp;hl=en"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smartio&amp;hl=en</a>"

Did you say jif?
you are not using replacement note 7
Samsung BOOM 7
"omg. I hope MBHD doesnt change. He&#39;s so neat and thorough in all his reviews, fast and accurate. Really really credible. Keep up the awesome work!"

It is ip68.. Did the Apple Earpods make you think of the iPhone?
where can I get that shirt?
That ball of apple earphones though!
it lags because of the snapdragon 820

That T-shirt&#39;s awesome! can u get me a link? 😅
note 7 exploding. Oct 6 Samsung recall all note 7
very good review Marques. love ur smooth EZ going style.
That joker t-shirt...dope 👌
So it was a battery issue that caused the problems ?<br><br>if so Samsung shot themselves in the foot by not having removable batteries.
Lol he plugs dbrand in every vid
I like the t-shirt.
Where did you got the t shirt from....??
"I personally using note 7(South Korea Model)&amp; iPhone 7 Plus(Jet Black 256GB) and I notice that my note 7(replaced set) wil heat up when I put it inside my pocket. I don&#39;t know why but I demand an answer from Samsung. Not to mention that my iPhone 7 Plus also giving me some problem on battery life. Only get an 3.5hour+- battery life with no power saving mode, LTE and 15~50% brightness.....Quite disappointed on these two phone or even all flagship phone that had/has been released this year. The only.phone that I really can&#39;t complain much is OnePlus Three, except for non micro sd expantable storage,hard to purchase and the dull design this phone really prove to me that flagship doesn&#39;t have to be expensive, have fancy design, including fancy new technology, heavily modified(custom ROM) and even technology breakthrough. Just make a good phone that can be purchase by everyone, expensive doesn&#39;t equal to good."
hey MKBHD how many phones do u use
you should&#39;ve mentioned about its flexibility on resolution changes which could drastically save your battery life
i love that apple earpod ball
note 7 😬😬😬😬😬 Samsung  u sold out
"It&#39;s &quot;GIF&quot; by the way, the hell with &quot;JIF&quot;"
"Am I the only one who noticed the toy car between <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=6m12s"">6:12</a> to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=6m17s"">6:17</a>"
"Why, the exploding is a extra feature that&#39;s free from Samsung, you can blow you girlfriend literally if she get mad at you, even better set his home or car on fire, perfect revenge tool at you disposal."
Do you like black smartphones because you are african american?
"If you fly in Europe, a lot of companies they have a new message &quot;You can use your phone in airplane mode, unless it is a Samsung Note 7. Samsung Note 7 owners have to completely turn it off.&quot; They don&#39;t care if it is a new one or an old one.<br><br>Yesterday I have been in the Samsung Store near Tottenham Court Road in London and the Note 7 is on display, but turned off. I have asked to a &quot;Samsung Genius&quot; and she told me that since there is the risk for the phone to explode, they are not allowed to have it turned on."
yoooo that shirt is dope where can I get one?
i really want the note7 😍😍
What about the camera?
Hi. My iPhone 6s freezes as often as my Note 5. I&#39;ve never had a phone that doesn&#39;t time and again freeze on me. It usually happens when you really need it to work.








This is the best Phone i Recommend
Is it just me or do reviewers seem to always have bad signal and then complain about the battery life...?
on a scale on 1(terrible) to 10(revolutionary/top of the food chain)... how good do you think Pixel XL will be?






"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m29s"">5:29</a> that&#39;s what she said"
I&#39;m still here with my humble 5s
I&#39;m still here with my humble 5s
Dbrand  Dbrand Dbrand
note 7 is boom
The worst thing is the speaker for sure. I miss the front speakers on my htc one
"I received my phone on pre-order and at first I wasn&#39;t happy with it, but then some updates cane and I love it. I&#39;m still blown away by the display and the looks of this phone.  This phone is bomb. no pun intended"

Note 7 is amazing is different to all because have pen.... 🎉🎇🎆
"I have really slow Internet, so I read comments while the video buffers. Strategy works like a charm, you might even forget you were waiting for a video 😁"
"why don&#39;t you make reviews on XIAOMI phone, I mean they worth it... cuz they make  some serious DOPE phone..."
Can you please review the Xperia XZ ?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a> IP68*"
Best phone and camera? I am wondering if that is also compered with the Iphone 7?

Nice shirt
Still with Marshmallow. MEH
Who care about this shit phone
if this phone doesn&#39;t explore like a damn time bomb then it is a great phone
Note 7 or iPhone 7+?
"Plus Samsung will definitely get rid of the headphone jack soon enough and get with the times because it&#39;s the future and we all want better sound which the lightning port provides and the headphone jack just got old like really its more than 100 years old and most of us don&#39;t like wires and we should all be related to that because even Samsung brags about their wireless charging which is technically not wireless if u still have to have a wire connected to the wall or a computer, and the new airpods provide awesome sound even thought their wireless with the new chip they have inside like really lets be real here and not just followers apple is doing the best Job so far even in speed with the new A10 Fusion chip not to mention that the iPhone 6sd that came out a year ago is faster than the newest Samsung flagship that being the time bomb (galaxy note 7)"
Wow you&#39;re actually wrong you&#39;re just another android user that wants Samsung to sell more smartphones to seem better because new reviews show that the iPhone 7&#39;s display is the best display  out there even better than your tv i bet u probably have a cheap Samsung tv the reason you say the &quot;Samsung&#39;s display is better&quot; than the iPhone 7 is because u let your self go with the specs and u think bigger is better and obviously is not being the fact that a less pixel display is better than Samsung
where did he get that shirt?!?!
wish they made an all aluminum version of this phone my friends have it and  the glass broke already on two of them
"I don&#39;t know what else Samsung can do for TouchWiz, but they need to do something in order to make the overall UI more lightweight and fluid. Hopefully, they make strides in that regard with the Galaxy S8."
"im a corny guy but bias aside, YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT UP WITH THE PUNS. just make sure theyre a)tasteful/well executed and b)kept to a minimum! keep it up bro!"
finally i was starting to think you were way too iphone
Its ip68 certified not ip67
"The best smartphone ever, period. <br>Marques, two more years and you can play golf for the rest of your life guaranteed. You&#39;ve earned it."
iPhone 7+ vs Note 7 review!!!
ew that att logo. how gay
Smaller battery yes but it&#39;s Lithium-polymer so it&#39;s newer battery technology so thus better as the S7 Edge has a Lithium-ion battery. Oh and it has IP68 rating not IP67.
Hey what shirt is that? Is it available to buy anywhere?
Yea I prefer the black color over the blue one myself I debated on rather or not to get the blue since blue is my favorite color but I opted out seeing as I like the black color on phones better.  Funny thing is that I used to love the white color on phones before the Note 5 that is as the white note 5 was only in 32GB models so I went for black saphire then because I had no choice and turns out I liked black better after I got it in my hands.
Nah. This phone is too slow for me. I&#39;ll stick with the iPhone 7. 😬✌️️


where u get those t-shirts
It&#39;s IP68
"I&#39;ve always went Samsung, recently leaving android all together after having the note 4 since preorder. After years of debate. I have to say. I really enjoy how much better all my fav apps work on ios. I love the lack of lag that I rather be with the second best. And it not fair that most apps does 2-4 more functions on iOS over android."



why dont u do a review on the lg v20
yep I&#39;ll still be getting a iPhone 7+

But does it explode??
shit phone samsung note 3 note 4 were the best please get back to making phone that impress
why no mlh support again
i don&#39;t even afford to get exploded T^T
I kept thinking that the note looked really small for a big phone but then I forgot the Marques Mahoosive Hands Factor. ;-)
wtf? 30% at the end of the night and heavy use?? I&#39;m at 30% @ lunch time!! <br><br>then I have to hurry up to charge it for an hour to try to get as many milliamps in my battery! 😄😄
Love ur reviews bro.
my idol. MKBHD
expandable memory!
Hopeful problems will be fixed
So are you using your RED camera for this vid?
You are not the only one who is holding it wrong..... I have smaller hand and the same problem :(
"I have the phone.  Is anyone else experiencing irregular phantom touches or unresponsive taps?  Updated the touch firmware via the codes,  hard reset, restarted, even used those calibration apps. Phone is still not smooth."
"Dude the time is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=4m20s"">4:20</a>"
"they keep trying to improve the camera and screen . most people dont give a shit and just want better battery life , response time and durability"
I like it
HE SAID JIF
"Is it only me or is that car in the background really annoying <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=6m10s"">6:10</a>"
"okay dude,  where did you get that shirt? I have to have it"
6k 01st Comment!!!
DBrand is a scam. I can&#39;t believe you support them MKB.






ya it&#39;s a good phone prolly the best money can buy right now  can&#39;t justify upgrading from note 4 though .Note 4 is selling for half the price and does 90% of the stuff with ease .note 4 should be in the hall of fame of smartphones .
Better then IPHONE 7/Plus How: Better camera <br>          better display <br>           best looking <br>           most improved from last years <br>         WAYYY MORE FEATURES <br>          bigger display <br>BUT IPHONE is faster and ehhh that&#39;s it
lmao I feel so bad for all the people who get incredibly triggered by people who pronounce &quot;gif&quot; in a certain way.
i was on a flight today ..they said: who Ever has galaxy Note 7 please switch it off
I really like the note 7 and was planning to purchase it until i saw the battery problems that come with it... not sure if i should still go with it cuz i don&#39;t want to use iPhone anymore

But you need to restart the phone every 3 to 5 days
"GIF , WITH A G NOT JIF"
No thanks but thanks for the review.
I am loving the info and I am getting this phone but did you know that you have a YouTube twin named Adande (Swooze)?
that wallpaper though
Felt like the Sound is not Synced right with the video!
note 7 has been planted
"I just got  my note 7 yesterday, after I return it, how can I  check out if my has that green battery  sign showing,  where do I have to click ?"
&quot;I don&#39;t always use the s pen but when I do... It&#39;s kinda nice&quot;
&quot;Highest end parts available&quot; Hello? Exynos&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Snapdragon tho
"I doubt all phones explode, like you stated on the video description. It<br> is not great, it&#39;s the best. I don&#39;t know if you are one of those apple<br> fanboys, but there are others equally great and iphones are on the top <br>10, somewhere at the bottom. Even now, Huawei does better phones that <br>apple. Apple has become a follower and survives mostly thanks to those <br>who buy its products because they can&#39;t afford real expensive things."
iPhone 7 or Samsung note 7👍🏻 comment below which one you prefer
Awesome phone. The camera is good but the display!!!!!!!!!! unbelievable
Note 7 is the bomb
"It&#39;s so sad to think that almost no average consumer will ever watch this and actually consider a Note 7. The company has a permanent stain on it, and I don&#39;t know if the world will ever see Samsung the same way after this recall. It really is a shame."
dont you mean EXPLOSIVE features?! hahahahahah .......ha........ha..... i need help... xD
you&#39;re holding it wrong. haha.  It reminds me of another crappy phone manufacturer.
If note 7 have the batch of battery indicator will it not explode ?
"This phone vs LG V20, any comparisons?"
I&#39;m sure I could get more out&#39;ve it with my use but hearing 3hrs SOT from a note phone is pretty depressing.
the gif maker is pointless.
Desperately want this device!
just wish you could do the simple things with Android      like mirror them to a tv without internet
Where did you get that shirt?
"what speakers are on your desk? looks pretty, does those sound good? ;)"
Always a fair and straight up review.
"Literally, this is the best review of the Note 7 on youtube👏"
"I really hope apple doesn&#39;t go this route with the next iPhone. There just isn&#39;t a good way to hold Samsung phones. You&#39;re always touching something by accident. Yes, it&#39;s pretty , but ergonomic it is not."
did you make the earpod paperweight? need that lol
Do you stole that phone :v (?
fingerprints... Debrand skin... <br><br>Ssssssstop it!
what do you think about a giveaway yaaay
dude what about microsd slot does it have it? what about ir blaster? i know smartphone companies started to drop this but why? i just want a smartphone with Samsung/apple lvl camera htc lvl design/fromt facing speakers or maybe a better speaker and audio quality IR blaster idc if it&#39;s a gimmick there&#39;s no reason to drop it future smartphones should do more not less. why cant a smartphone company build such a thing? btw fuck google for droping project ARA
Oh shit!  Showin&#39; off Neumann Films&#39; RED HDRx footage on the AMOLED!
he said note 7 battery is average lol
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=4m56s"">4:56</a> &quot;i didnt think as quite as secure as other security method&quot; if iris scanning isn&#39;t secure,  what do you think is more secure lol."
How did he get the all black lock-screen that looks so simple and clean?
"I had the Note 7 Corel Blue at launch, and while I did go through the honey moon phase of the phone and the recall issues. I really did not find myself using the pen all that much mainly cause I had and mean &quot; HAD &quot; to get a screen protector and it interfered with the pen too much for me. It just did not feel like writing on glass. Plus the entire G5 glass is complete shit imo, less scratch resistance which means even change in your pocket will .....WILL scratch your phone even with the screen protector on. I opted for the S7 Edge and saved $400 and I still have a phone which is equal as fast without the pen."
So early
"Great review. This phone actually seems , dare I say it, better than the iPhone 7/7 Plus. I noticed that I don&#39;t see a iPhone 7 review video."
it is the best phone in the world...that explodes. bahahaha.







damn.. this phone has worse battery life than the iphone se.<br><br>still a nice phone though
nohomo but that was a very nice outrou
Marques is on &quot;team JIF&quot;! lol
"I&#39;m disappointed, no EOD suit?"
"Exchanged mine, had it a few days always careful with it and placed it in my pocket rode to the store, pulled it out and the screen was broke.... I do not wear tight jeans and did not have anything in the pocket with the phone.  :("
"dude, do you have twin sisters?"
I have the S7 edge which I like but the glass over the camera has crack on it. anyone else have this issue? I was reading that it could have got hot and cracked. I never dropped it or anything. one day I looked at it and noticed it has a crack through it.
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m58s"">1:58</a> is stock android right? How do you get it like that? Is it a launcher or what?"
"did he just say &quot;jif&quot;? oh, I can feel the pain"
Will never pay $800 for a phone that I can&#39;t easily change the battery.
Is that bracelet of his a gadget?
"Marques, I seriously dreamt I purchased MKBHD edition Jordans! They looked DOPE! Complete with signature and red/black color scheme! (there&#39;s a thought!)"
Still going to be the next Phone I buy
Did I get it right?<br><br>Marques<br>Kline<br>Brownlee<br>High<br>Definition







That shirt tho....
wtf was that pile of apple earpods
This phone is dynamite.
ip67?  I thought it was ip68
i like you 😍☝ and your review!)
just get a oneplus 3 for half the price lmao
"The Cheapest Bomb Technology available <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Jihad"">#Jihad</a> 🙈"
Isn&#39;t the Note IP68 like the S7 line?
"Saw a bunch of users on reddit claiming they were getting 9 hours screen on, I thought it was bullshit, now I know. Seemed way too good."
&#39;Cause its so hard to take an old Note 7 and slap a green battery thing on there
"hello if possible could someone tell me what game he was playing at 1.40, thank you"
This review was as lit as the Note 7.
The review:  it blows!
Gif not jif.
could you do app reviews maybe as well?
Where can I get one of those Joker shirts?
"noooooo not &quot;jif&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;gif&quot;"
&quot;The Lag is still there&quot; Typical Samsung XD
is there an android phone in similar size to iphone 7 with similar specs?<br>can&#39;t seem to find anything decent. :/
It&#39;s probably the CPU governor in the kernel that makes it do that when you unlock it.  Probably doesn&#39;t jump from 384MHz to whatever frequency it tops out at fast enough.
"The Note is IP68 not IP67...Too much iPhone usage, right? ;)"
yo where you get that shirt
I bought mine yesterday from our local AT&amp;T store however mine does not reflect the green battery. It is still showing white. I asked about it and they said it will be green with a system update. Is this true or should I demand an exchange??
I love the way you make all your videos. You are definitely the best
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=8m28s"">8:28</a> , what a pun !"
"Is it possible to use Iris as a second or third layer of security? If yes, amazing!"
this is cool
"Questions. (if anyone in the comments can answer the questions I&#39;d appreciate it.) I&#39;m looking for a slim small camera that I can use for camping, hiking, hunting. I don&#39;t need 4k recording or images stabilization 20x zoom. I&#39;m looking for something that&#39;s better then current camera phone but it&#39;s mostly photos that I&#39;ll share on Instagram and Facebook... Preferably under 350 (I know I could get away with like a sg7 or iPhone, but I want something that has better resolution that after in home and I&#39;m my room I may want to crop or edit some of the photos) thanks in advance."
great review as always <br>i can&#39;t imagine my self using non amoled display phone
We need an ASK MKBHD
review after so many Notes Exploded!
"Samsung Note in Europe, No and again No thank you. Payback from last time. <br>Give me the Pixel XL instead."
your reviews are too neat
wallpaper?
Tread carefully sir.
wow! its got multitasking!
I have a Note 5. I am still pretty satisfied with it. Is there anything exciting we know of coming down the pike that can make me feel better about saving my money and waiting for the Note 8?
Can Note 7 Just Have The Note 4 Or 5 Battery Rather than Lithium ion battery?
Battery please
IP68.
And you want to say that this video was not sponsored? Yee right.
"Phone reviews have gotten pretty stale. They still serve a purpose but I find myself not watching them anymore. I like when I see other things reviewed more (tesla, drones, etc)"
"I have mine on medium power mode and haven&#39;t charged it for about 25 hours, and this is after a full day at school and heavy usage at night on IG and Tinder etc, and i still have 38%. The battery is the best i&#39;ve had in a smart phone. Huge upgrade in life after the s6, which i would have to charge at least once a day."

explode my ass. I couldn&#39;t wait to trade my iPhone 7 in for this puppy. couldn&#39;t be happier
"Hey, Its the same apple earpods ball covering the iphone, which you guys created in one of the Jonathan&#39;s video. :P"
"Have you noticed any battery issues with the replacement? I have read people complaining that they have experienced their phone not holding a reasonable charge, etc."
He&#39;s just &#39;THE BEST 👌🏼&#39;
Excellent Video for a top notch phone!!! Always to the point MKBHD. Can you make a video of how to use pro mode on note 7 or s7 like a pro 😉. Like you make &quot;Explained&quot; videos. Btw you didn&#39;t make any &quot;Explained&quot;  video since a while. ☺
Note7 is a dream came true phone.
not the best camera out Motorola droid turbo 2 has a 21 megapixel camera
What background do you have on this phone? And what style of art is it? I really like it
Wallpaper?
what video editing tool you use??
no infra red...
just imagine note 7 with ios10 on 🤔🤔🤔
Still the best reviewer on YouTube.  A million thanks.
Is it me or do you have huge hands?
"So... I created several GIFs and when shared, they&#39;re converted into a still picture. 🤔 Otherwise, nothing beats a Note 7 and it&#39;s multitude of features."
Your Intro Beat is soooo awesome!!
Vs oneplus 3?
"Aside from the whole explosion debacle! The Galaxy Note 7 is the best smartphone your money can buy right now!<br>BEST CAMERA + BEST DISPLAY + FASTEST ANDROID PROCESSOR + IMPROVED GRACE UX + LOT OF GREAT FEATURES (Like Always on Display, Iris Scanner, Secure Folder etc.) AND LOT MORE!<br>What do you Guys think?"
where do you get that T-shirt? looks great

Design and technology of Samsung + iOS app ecosystem (My favorite phone).
I loved the design but touchwiz still feels lil hit or miss
what up Marques  I see you still doing the tech reviews!  Good for you! Keep up the great work man!  btw may the force be with you
the thumbnail made me think of a woman with a note 7 between her legs.
"The feature where he made a gif from a YouTube video, is that only on the note 7? I have the s7 edge, is it possible to do it on my phone?"
Are you going to review the LG v20
LoveD iT .....BRo
Hey what is that you wear on your wrist??
hey mkhd any contest or giveaways for a note 7. trying to get one but can&#39;t really afford to.
"I stuck with Note 7, everyone screws up every now and then. No issues with replacement phones."
ka BOOOOOM!!
&quot;...glass melts over the edge.&quot;  Good one!
"i expected the smoke somewhere in the video, not disappointed :)"
what an explosive review michael bay would be proud.
Boom
There&#39;s not been a single Note 7 explosion! Your mischaracterization of the problem is off-putting! Will it hurt to be truthful and accurate and point out that the problem is overheating and melting of batteries while charging? Geez! Enough with the sensationalism!
"Okay Marques - the Waffle house photo - that&#39;s right in front of Rainbow Carwash here in Abingdon, MD.  What the hell were you doing in my town? I was there yesterday getting my car washed! Haha!"
"I know the question on everyone&#39;s mind, can the phone be charged underwater?.. since it&#39;s water resistant, and since you want to prevent it from blowing up."
this is my favorite movie
Can you post a link to the wallpaper you used?
Graiphic Interchange Format... G .... G.I.F end of
top specs <br><br>snapdragon 820????<br>just sayin phones with 821 are already out
Note 7 might be the best phone right now but I still prefer my Note 4 with removable battery. I still have all features of the Note 7 except iris scanner and water resistance which I don&#39;t need. I also think the metal and faux leather looks more classier than all glass. Just my opinion.
thank you for this review marques u r the best 😉😉😉😉
Where did you get your shirt?!?
I don&#39;t like this note series 😶
Did MKBGD just say jif??
"Hello,Marques!I would like to know when will you make a LG V20 review,witch in my opinion will be the best phone of the end of the year."
"very fair about the battery, great review! will be getting one soon :D"
so how is the battery life so far after the replcement??
This phone is also known as SAMSUNG TNT
شكرا
Camera on 950 XL is the best camera on any smart phone.
You are literally the best tech reviewer.
saygus V squard check it out and what do you think of it
quality products
MKBDH I love the wallpaper on your Imac! Can you me a link to it please!
when is the updated note 7 competing out for the public?(if you don&#39;t own one)
austin 😂😂
So you turned it on inside an airplane?
"You talked about iris scanning like it never existed before, what about the Lumia 950/XL? been almost a year since it was there<br>I smell ignorance towards that OS not giving it any chance.. too much bias lately I really miss your reviews of Windows phones they are not the same anymore. too much disappointment on you MKBHD.<br>Oh wait it&#39;s Windows 10 Mobile of course.."


Great phone! <br>I was watching that video too of the Tesla beating on the Lambo Huracan!
This phone is slow and laggy and now it had crap battery time yeah I want pay $900 for that phone... NOT!!!!!


"I watch all of your videos as soon as you release them because I feel like you are as unbiased as it gets. Me being an Android guy, I even watch all of your iPhone reviews because I genuinely care about what you think of them and the software. You&#39;re awesome man, keep up the good reviews!"
How much amount did samsung paid you for this review??
Your videos are amazing but the Note 7 sucks!  Boom!
Samsung galaxy Allahu Akbar 7
"Ball of earpods at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m19s"">7:19</a>!"
"hey, marques can you please make a comparison camera review of note5 vs iphone7"
Why does marques always do a montage to show how cool the phone is <br>It&#39;s cool-ed tho
ALLAHU AKBAR
Want that wallpaper can someone pls post the link ??






"Phone vibration at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=05m55s"">05:55</a> :P"

"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Teamcrispy"">#Teamcrispy</a> shots right on point ✌️"
the battery still have problem or not?
Samsung phones are getting sexier each year
"Lol, reviewing a grenade..."
"Hey marques they need to work on that palm rejection, I&#39;m glad you covered that. My huge gripe is that this thing is power hungry like you said. It drains so much that the backpack charger can&#39;t keep up with the demand while the phone is on. Other than that it&#39;s a beautiful phone."
Before exploding they shout Allahu Akbar!
"spen is really nice thing to have , I have Note 3 and I like taking notes"
Ip68? Not ip67?
New Tech YouTube Channel! Come check us out and Subscribe If you like!😊
"daaayyuummmm those shots looked good, it was like wallpapers in movement"
One feature Apple could use is explosions. If your note 7 gets robbed no problem it will explode when the robber runs too fast with it! 😂
"Not the jif, anything but the jif."
S7 edge still the best. Rooted and installed a custom rom on mine its the G.O.A.T.
Whats his wallpaper?
military now throws note 7 instead of grenade.. lol
dope review dt fone s fire🕯🕯🕯 dts y it explode n dts my nxt mobile 4 2016
Nuclear attack in coming.
The video was marvelous! Great work Marques :)
"actually, the re-release has a 2 in the model number, for example...Samsung N930P(2)"
Almost there with the echo
I wish he did reviews for Huawei... It&#39;s more affordable...
&quot;I can definitely still get my 3h of SOT&quot;.... dealbreaker right there!<br><br>Who remembers when Note phones could get 10h SOT minimum?
"Hey Marques, do you plan on doing a giveaway for the note 7"
Would be a lot better if it had stereo speakers
"why is snapchat bad on android phones,my phone takes crappy photos when I use snapchat like wth?"
"Did you forget to mention the fact that the note 7 has the edge features? Also, what took so damn long to review this phone?"
"@MKBHD, when you talked about the water proofing and how the speaker quality is affected by this, why not give credit to Apple with the iPhone 7/7 Plus having great sound quality, dual speakers and water proofing? Keep up the great work, your videos are the best out there."
"holy crap, 3 hours SoT is unacceptable for a flagship device.<br><br>anyway, hope you are safe though using it as a daily driver.<br>because recent news state that the &quot;safe&quot; Note 7 still explodes."
Where did he get the cool joker shirt?
"It seems to me more like a sponsoring/report paid by Samsung in order to clean the explosion mess. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do like Samsung, a lot. I have a S6 edge Plus and I&#39;ve been a Samsung fan for almost 5 years... Still, this looked a little too much to me."
"in your opinion, what&#39;s the best phone on the market currently?"
Let&#39;s take a moment to laugh at the iPhone ...<br><br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
shame samsung messed up
Interesting timing
"laggy, lousy speakers... typical Samsung"
You live in Maryland? 👀
"Honestly, I disagree with you on the tossup between the s7 edge and the note 7. I received an s7 edge as a loaner during the recall and I was very disappointed with the device&#39;s performance. I may have gotten a bad unit but the one I received got warm much faster than my original note and was much warmer overall with any sort of moderate use as well as wireless charging. The phone lagged quite often too, especially when bringing up the keyboard on screen and the battery life was miserable. Wrapping an 8 hour work day, my note was generally around 57% is percent, while my S7 Edge was consistently around 35%. I had everything set up almost the same for both devices but the S7 always seemed to burn through battery awfully fast for sitting in a pocket. One day it actually became so warm in my pocket that I was worried about permanent damage to the device, it was EXTREMELY hot to the touch just from sitting IDLE! Overall though, I&#39;m VERY happy with the Note 7 and this is coming from a person who I had the iPhone 4, 4s, 5, 6, 6 plus and 6s plus as well as more than a handful of Android phones including the galaxy s5, s6 droid incredible, droid RAZR and a few others. I won&#39;t be switching back to iOS for quite awhile"
Will you be doing a Sony Xperia XZ/ XZ compact review?
"It has bee a month since the phone was released,  too late Mr. Brown. After all your review is dope! late is not a problem"
"WTF is that at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m17s"">7:17</a>?!!"
still want iphone but that joker shirt is nice
it&#39;s ip68 not ip67
i wonder if they&#39;ll use the old Note 7&#39;s in the upcoming transformers movie for FX
The new ones are also exploding 😂<br>Happened with a Chinese guy yesterday.
If it doesn&#39;t have a DAC like the note 5 I won&#39;t give it the light of day.
Overtime I&#39;ve been a dual platform user; always had a note along with an iPhone. I let go of my note 5 and settled down with my iPhone 6+ 128Gb. <br><br>I want to upgrade but the new iPhone has a major drawback for me. I always use my phone in be while it&#39;s plugged in to watch YouTube. I keep my audio private with a pair of Apple earphones. If I upgrade to the iPhone 7 I&#39;ll need a pair of wireless earphones that I can conveniently use while plugged in. Not sure if that is possible. Else I might be forced to add an adapter to the already heavy iPhone. <br><br>I&#39;m thinking of getting the note 7 instead but I&#39;m worried about the explosive battery. I have nothing against android.
Ok why is this phone only $177 on the Chinese site? Is it a knock off? If so why are you pitching a knock off site?
GREATEST phone on the planet (period)👍😃
"wtf <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m19s"">7:19</a>"
Beware of that battery it may make you angry
"It&#39;s still hard to get them, but hopefully they will be fully available for replacement and new sales next week."
Better than the LG V20&#39;s camera?
Yeah....but the iPhone 7 is still faster lol!
WAFFLE HOUSE!!!!!!!
the t shirt....awesome. where.
NO WAY! YOU GET TO MAKE GIFS??????
i want one
"Hey marques what do you think, about the rumors of the the one plus 4?"
I disagree that water resistant phones always have bad speaker performance. My iPhone 7plus is IP67 certified and the speakers are BOSS!
When will this phone be for sale by carriers again?? Can&#39;t find it on Samsungs website
Fast charging has been proven to shorten the life of your phone&#39;s battery ....  I turned mine off.... Also I&#39;m not a fan of sealed batteries so I won&#39;t be upgrading....  Neat phone though for those who want.
It has an IP 68 rating not 67
What camera does he use to film these? His B-roll always looks so fantastic.
Rather have a Sony makes me sleep better at night while I charge my phone
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=8m34s"">8:34</a> more like 30 out of 2 million"
I think I&#39;ll pass on this year&#39;s note. I&#39;ll wait and see on the next one.
"I think it&#39;s time to set the stage for some drone was. DJI Mavic Pro vs. GoPro Karma. Two of the best, head2head"
Cool T.....
this sounded like a commerical than a review. Damn it Marques.
hope they fix this battery issues if not will get the s7 edge
IP68.
Didn&#39;t even mention usb C or the fact the screen scratches easily.
they need to let people remove the battery again
keep months good work. I was wondering what that Green battery light was about. I too have traded mines in.
"There still too much lag in touchwiz and for that kind of price there asking thats not acceptable. The Hardware is great and so is the camera. The cam on this and the 7Plus are basically even, but man with owning a RED cam you should know the colors are not spot on like your were saying. They look great but not as natural as they should, just take a picture of red flowers and you can tell easily. Still best phone sammy ever made, but at this point all there phones this whole year are basically the same they mine as well sell the s-pen separately and have it work on all galaxy&#39;s."
&#39;&#39;jif&#39;&#39; triggered
I remember when he had 1.5 mil 😢
Sick shirt Marques!
"If you have to hold it &quot;right&quot;, the design is flawed. Previous example: iPhone 4&#39;s antennagate."
Nice joker shirt
"The new features include new camera, better display, better battery life and a bomb."
mine has the &quot;green battery icon&quot; im safe here 👍
Love the camera on the Note 7 S7 &amp; S7 edge just wish they had that 20 mega pixel like the one that Sony Xperia has with Carl Zeiss lots of people sleep on that phone its water resistant also Android is just better than Apple period
I&#39;ll take my iPhone 7 over an exploding battery any day of the week.
SIR WE ARE OUT OF GRANADES...<br>THEN THROUGH THE NOTE 7s!!
"Apple will always copy Samsung cause them South Koreans got that technology. If Samsung never came out with 5 + inch screens, their competitor (Apple) would still till this day have them 3.5 inch screens like the 3GS and 4."
How can you say the note 7 and s7 are design refresh but Apple is stale? Kinda hypocritical the s6 s7 both edges and the note 5 and 7 look the damm same
Is there a huge difference between this and the s7 edge?
great stuff!!
nice shirt.
i also have a GN7 ATT but my battery is still white. i replaced mine at BestBuy and check the new phone IMEI and it is safe but no Green Battery Indicator
Isn&#39;t it ip68



Those apple headphones 😂
the new ones do explode as well by the way
Crispy AF
I&#39;ll buy samsung 2 months later. I need the best camera and the possibility of an android.
marques u were too easy on samsung with the exploding battery.  if that was apple u would have ripped them apart
where did you get that joker shirt from?
Very nicely reviewed. On point as usual. Only 1 Q : Where and When can I get an unlocked Note 7?
do you vape ?
thats why it took a long time for you to do a review cause ur waiting for the replacement. nice
"It&#39;s IP68, AKA WATERPROOF. It&#39;s the iPhone 7 that&#39;s only IP67 water resistant."
Great vídeo! Amazing
707 dislike From Iphone FanFags
"When apple gets a bad battery, BOOOOOO, when Samsung does it, oh lemme just talk about it for ten seconds  and move on, REALLY?? These phones exploded, they fucked up, ApPLE GAVE SAMSUNG A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY, stop makin excuses ."
That camera😍
&quot;You&#39;re holding it wrong&quot;<br>- Steve Jobs
once again The note still the one phone you want to own if you want to blow somebody&#39;s mind..😉 The best phone ever made ..
Seriously! You have a ball of iBuds?
Allahu Akbar
had to fav this. great video👌
"Hey bro sorry to tell you guys who live the galaxy line, the new phones are exploding as well. I was considering to get one, but this has solidified that I will continue to be on the iPhone for a while."
"I am using <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Note7"">#Note7</a> since last one month , I did replaced with new Green battery Note 7 and  i am loving it. I was thinking about <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Iphone"">#Iphone</a> 7 plus but didnt impressed me much.<br><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MKBHD"">#MKBHD</a> please make a detail video about how to save battery or extend battery life."
"You guys forget about the Huawei P9, which actually has the best smartphone camera"
Great video
Thanks for the great review!
"Hey MKBHD its IP68, The iPhone 7 is the IP67."
"wait, did anyone else notice how he used this pre-recall version on the plane?"

Nice shirt - would you mind sharing where you purchased it?
I have heard people are having major battery drain issues with the new note 7&#39;s. Does anyone actually have a new note 7 that does this?
How to get an INTERNATIONAL NOTE 7
should i get this or a oneplus 3?
that note 7 skin looks Awesome!!!!
I feel like it would overheat bc of the brightness
finally you give it your best recommended best phone...   I&#39;m waiting for this time that u totally confidence about thia best products.. it&#39;s true that after s7edege this is the next best smartphone in this word..  no competition...    thnks buddy&#39;s. and one more think u are a great youtuber
"MKBHD dint review this phone for a long time did he know from before that it&#39;s going to explode,so why did he wait for review,Conspiracy? 😂"
Boom!
your shirt is awesome
Mkbhd you can&#39;t say Samsung is on top of the build quality game if they use   mostly glass. That crown goes to HTC or Apple.
My new surface pro4 only has 4gbs of ram..... now a phone has the same :( <br>Poopy...
&quot;The elephant in the room&quot; with the focus on the elephant lmao
&quot;..and explosions.&quot; i lol&#39;d
only Samsung
That&#39;s a bomb ass phone!!


What was your first Note Phone?
This is the video ive been waiting for &lt;3 VAI CHEGAR NO BRASIL POR QUANTO? 6 MIL REAIS?
Did you move to LA?
"<a href=""https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154650842359175&amp;id=165237414174"">https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10154650842359175&amp;id=165237414174</a> Please check this out MKBHD this was a new note 7 with the green battery indicator"
whos watching on galaxy s6
Is the note 5 just as good?
"I like that gif feature, is it available for other androids?"
what was that ball of apple earpods?
the note 7 is the bomb!..... Literally
i want one of these so bad<br>i got a huawei y360! ToT
Nobody should be holding their phone with their palm resting on the display.. your pinky should be resting below the phone and holding it in place.  i&#39;ve seen this complaint about touching the curved display so many times trying to find faults with the dual edged panel
"Samsung can kill the iPhone in one shot if they this to the note 8.<br><br>- Add decent frontfacing speakers<br>- Add a fingerprint reader on the back<br>- Remove the bloatware<br><br><br>Dual cameras would be gimmicky, but I guess they could add it anyway just to fuck with Apple (And Huawei) even more.<br><br><br>I&#39;m not a fanboy btw"
I purchased the note 7 and imo the phone is complete trash.<br>Text messaging is useless and the other 100 worthless options is a complete waste.<br>iPhone 7 plus is the best way to go.
What has changed in the battery?....... What the difference? .......Better or worse?..... Is it the same and now  safe?
watching this from my kw88 smartwatch lol
shirt too lit 🔥🔥 do they have a Jared leto version
Even the &quot;fixed&quot; Note 7s have been caught exploding. Samsung fucked up...
"Samsung... ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS ADD GOD DAMN FRONT FACING STEREO SPEAKERS! Thats whats stopping me from buying a Note, still using my old Nexus 6."
"My Note 7 is sitting beside me, 61% battery after 36 hours of not charging it. I use it all day too ¯\<i>(ツ)</i>/¯."
Galaxy Note 7 Review - It&#39;s Lit lol<br><br>Title Improved
"Don&#39;t wanna say shit on Samsung,  but wasn&#39;t the note 7 banned in airports?... and if I&#39;m right?  Jow the heck did he got on a plane? "
@MKBHD I have been waiting for this review...
marques  can we have a link to that  wallpaper?
"I doubt you&#39;re gonna convince any flight attendant anytime soon that the Note 7 is safe, even if you show her a green battery symbol.  That means absolutely nothing to her.  Only after the new batch of Note 7s have been out in the wild safely for a few months without incident, will you see the airlines relaxing restrictions on Note 7s. I read last weekend that a man in China reported that his replacement Note 7 imploded."
Stuff to the gills
Actually one of the new replacement Note 7 that is claimed to be safe exploded in China. It is the fifth explosion in China and still Samsung didn&#39;t replace the old ones in China up till this moment.
Lol I was almost confused when I saw Note 7 review. Definitely late but this is the only Note 7 review I wanna watch.
Best review ever made about the Note 7 i should say.
I am neutral on mobile phones..but why do I feel I just watched a Samsung commercial.
Bro!!!! theres a waffle house in Jersey?!!!!!!! awww yeah.
I hope they fix it so I could get it
Gotta say this is one of the best reviews I&#39;ve ever seen by mkbhd imo
What are the wallpapers you use MKBHD?
how about reviewing the Asus Zenfone 3 Deluxe or Ultra?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m31s"">7:31</a> no! Not IP67 it&#39;s IP68 ;)"
Note 7 Vs Iphone 7 Plus.
Note 7 Vs Iphone 7 Plus.
V20 is the best phone made so far
it&#39;s IP68 rating *
great video mate
can you provide a download link to a video you have that is uncompressed 4k?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m31s"">3:31</a> marques why did you take a pic of me"
Please don&#39;t watch my videos they&#39;re terrible.
Does anyone know when the note 7 goes back on sale?
thanks for that review...didn&#39;t know they already have the new note7 out
peace
I&#39;m not sure the flight crews throughout the world would have any idea about the green battery icon.  I think if they don&#39;t see the words Samsung Note7 they could care less.
Please... I need to know where to get your shirt!
Why do you need to use your phone to navigate if you have a tesla to do it for you
"Actualy I thought the Note 7 was hidding some kind of genitals on thumbnail...<br><br><br>I&#39;ve lost my glasses, take this in account"
I hope it doesnt explode haha :D
"MKB says all water resistant phones have issues with the speakers. Not so, my iPhone 7 Plus has fantastic stereo speakers. It can be done."
How did you take it on the plane didnt the ban it from planes?
Great video!  Yes I too am a power user of my Note 7 which I recently replaced because it was one of the &quot;bad ones!&quot;  LOL
a bit of echo in the audio
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m58s"">5:58</a> phone vibrates!"
"Woah, this phone really blew up."
can you give me one?
le monde bouge avec la haute technologie
THANK FOR POSTING THIS VIDEO. I was wondering the last few weeks when you would post. I&#39;ve been waiting for you to upload it. Thanks for the peeks on Snapchat.
Wait doesn&#39;t the note 5 have a better camera??? I thought the note 5 has a 16 mp camera. btw I have a note 5
Those headphones lol smoking that dank
"Ahh!!! That Ball of earphones gave me headaches! why u have to show that @<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m16s"">7:16</a> ??"
Finally!!!
Apple beat samsungs galaxy s7 and note in real world waterproof tests
now that the new corrected batch has been delivered it&#39;s time to buy one now.
The Note 7 is the Bomb
"The camera is amazing on my S7, literally looks DSLR quality. The video is just... holy crap"
Samsung Pay MST worth a mention. always on display and screen off note jotting definitely a mentionable feature
Did they fix that bug where the phone exploded in the new update?
The Note 7 is the bomb. Literally...
Where the heck did he get that shirt???
Where did he get that joker shirt?? so fucking beast;
"No matter how much I know about the device, I always check MKBHD&#39;s opinion for reasonss -_-"
"hey the note 7 comes with an extra feature, you ever in trouble? just charge it and be amazed😀😊"
"BEST.PHONE.PERIOD What the Note 7 can do is pretty much unparreled to most phones, like watching movies in 60fps. <b>P.S. The exploding jokes are about as old as the iPhone 7 design, situation has already been remedied</b>"
I&#39;m just waiting for tmobile to start selling them again so I can upgrade
kinda sad GN7 is sexier than my GS7e
"To bad it runs on skynet, i mean andoid"
It&#39;s good to know Samsung still has a least one fan on Youtube :P
Until Samsung offers dual/universal LTE (FDD/TDD) functionality they fall short of the standard that even Samsung declared was necessary to be successful back in 2013.<br>Thus far only Apple provides this functionality rendering the iPhone the only phone fully compatible with international usage.
"eh, this thing is expensive , delicate and slippery, lackluster speaker doesn&#39;t help either. Would prefer a mimic of the Moto X Pure with a better screen and camera"
"Did your house burn down yet? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23noOffenseToSamsung"">#noOffenseToSamsung</a>"
"I can&#39;t wait for the lg v20 , I thought about the note but it gets scratched easily and Samsung takes for ever to update and the v20 has a removable battery and has better protection (:"
&quot;When it&#39;s not exploding&quot;<br>That&#39;s still a better feature than iPhone 7&#39;s new features.
"Marques<br><br>Great review. To the point, not drab, informative and I got to laugh a couple times.<br><br>Thanks for the info.<br><br>John"
Shitty speakers and BOOM
he had to take a photo of the phone on an airplane.......
Hey remember when Samsungs motto was &quot;plastic&quot;?
JIF? REALLY?
the battery explodes cuz it couldn&#39;t handle the power output of the note 7<br>Samsung just being cool and let iPhone shine for a few days 😎
Why do you have a ball of lightning Earpods.
i love you marques
Kind of sad to see two links to FAKE  Note 7s directly under Marques&#39; review of the real deal.  Why would anyone buy a piece of counterfeit crap like that? Just to make other people think they have a genuine one?
wow ur review came very early ! why didnt u wait till 2017 to make one ?
Marques never disappoints!! Quality Tech Videos Indeed
I remember the first time I saw a Samsung phone my younger brother had one and I was like Daaaaamn. It had a awesome deep color screen and when he played games it was just so smooth. Needless to say I was very jealous I didn&#39;t tell him tho cause I was the tech head in the family and how did he get a better phone than me. But I had the Note5 traded it for the Note7 and me and my girlfriend are cool. We will continue with the Note phones until they stop making them.
Haha yeah it&#39;s ip68
This phone is way better than the iPhone 7 or 7+. How anyone can try to argue that the iPhone is better is beyond me.
"beautiful fone, shit QC, embarrassing for such a huge manufacturer, when is android going to stop being shit?"
I like your shirt Marques!
First thing I&#39;m going to do after my skin grafts heal from the burns is get another Galaxy 7.
"um why <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m20s"">7:20</a>"
I wish he would do a speaker test to show us what they actually sound like.

my heart says iP7+ but my mind says GN7
Note7-IP68iPhone7-IP67
is ip68 dude
Shirt is doooope
record it to a jif? oh
"What should I get for my first phone? iPhone 7 or Note 7? I was think iPhone cause I&#39;ve always been a fan. But now I&#39;m distraught, MKBHD&#39;s videos make it look good...:/"
Tip for Android: please take the idea from Apple that allows you to use your phone or tablet while leaving your hand on the display. That is a feature I think many people love (those that use IOS).
what background is that?
Can&#39;t wait on the galaxy s8 to come out..
"someone could help me?<br>One plus 3, New Zenphone or this?<br>I do have money and I want the best quality,but I want to make the money worth"













"Great review ! They have improved and innovated the smartphone industry : Phablet, amoled display, edges, iris scanner... !  Samsung is the best right now even Apple can&#39;t keep up !  Only Lenovo ( / Motorola ) can do something ) can challenge with Moto Z !"
"I&#39;m just wondering, does the battery still heat up?? when you use data for about an hour or more"
new feature! use it as self defense :D(throw your flaming phone at a intruder)
finally a solid review!
It feels like you don&#39;t really know what to say as it&#39;s so similar to s7 Edge... Nice phone though!
iPhone 7 is way better looking than the Note7 especially the galaxy s7 to . iPhone is so much more cleaner looking !

nah ill pass. Dont want it to explode or something haha.
Samsung should make an Note Active line up. Imagine the power of a Note 7 with a long battery that&#39;s incredibly durable...
iPhone has a better camera
What phone should I get? I have a LG G2.
gif not jif get it right
YOU ARE LATE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its IP68 certified... the iphone is 67 that&#39;s probably why you got confused.
"hahaha, those 100 layers of earpods 😁"
"Короче крутой телефон со всеми фишками, и голову греть не придется переходя со старых моделей."
I really wanna stick w/ team android but I&#39;m thinking of switching to IOS for imessage and facetime. I&#39;m not sure tho. What do you guys think?






















"I have your tshirt picture on my MacBook from slick wraps , but I thought Dbrand sponsored this video??"
ip68
"Good phone, just laggy sometimes, feels unresponsive, and the battery is average."
How cool it would be if it exploded while you were filming this video!
Cool :)
The only thing holding me back from getting this phone is the s pen.  How nice is it and is there any kind of lag when you write with it?
phone go boom
where you are getting those t shirts  from?
Sorry marques but mr.mobile took ur spot as top tech reviewer




Who cares . Little late to the review party on this pocket boom boom . Next pls
I haven&#39;t experienced any lag... Its connected to my gear fit 2 all day. I get full day use about 40% left after 12hr shift. love it!
It&#39;s gif not jif
Dang this video &quot;blew up&quot;
Looks so much color than an iPhone. I may have to switch teams
"3 points I&#39;d like to add for Note users. 1 is the USB C, using the provided adapter I was able to connect a 1Tb external HDD &amp; transfer movies, music and large files flawlessly. My iPad Pro can&#39;t even do that. Secondly, I was able to charge my wireless headphones with the phone which I think it&#39;s a great perk. Last point is a negative which you mentioned is the snappiness of opening &amp; closing apps. Sometimes there&#39;s a stutter which such a high-end phone should not suffer from. Apple still does that better even on older phones like iPhone 6. I have had all iterations of the Note &amp; this by far has been the best experience."
is there any sign on the box to diff. the new patch ?
"For the first time ever I catch a fault in your videos. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m47s"">1:47</a> <br>Now I know even you are human Marques Brownlee"
awesome with out boom boom battery
The phone is attractive but i would not buy Samsung again. customer service is bad.... regional version always have lower spec than international(korean) version. very very slow on software update (almost no update on regional version).
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=8m45s"">8:45</a> That phone knows what&#39;s up. ; )"
I wouldn&#39;t say they &quot;literally exploded&quot;. If that were the case people anywhere near it would be getting injured from the shrapnel.
when his shirt is your phones background...
samsung just does it better
Link to wallpaper please!!
samsung its a shit
JIF???? You heathen! Shame! Shame! SHAME!
watching this on the s7 edge :&gt;)
It&#39;s da bomb! 💣
"Wait, you live in Reston? Damn, I&#39;m like 15 minutes away. <br><br>Also your use of &quot;jif&quot; has not gone unnoticed by me/us."
i still got my note 4 primed....think its time to upgrade :D
"Well, the best phone in the world at the minute, no doubt."
its pronounced GIF. NOT JIF
Samsung does make really good phones! Great review!
I am probably going to get a lg v20




As always great Review
3....2....1...boom there goes the note 7
as always great review bro.
Jif 😩 Dope video tho
I would love this phone but I can&#39;t live without iMessage and FaceTime. I also hate how bad Snapchat is on Android. these are the few things keeping me attached to the iphone. and I might just get the iphone 7 because of it.











*ip68
What brand of shirt is Marques wearing?? It looks so cool!!!

how much money tho?
"Well, I still don&#39;t understand the comment section. if you like iPhone then go use iPhone, you like android just use android. where is the point of attempting to change other people&#39;s own mind? free will? I used to be an android fan but now I prefer apple because it&#39;s easier and simpler, maybe it&#39;s dumber but I don&#39;t really care. yall have your reasons to love android as well."
Nice shirt! 👍
Aghhhh &quot;power user&quot; THE most self aggrandising statement ever!
"they started on fire, not exploded.. come on. I figured you of all people wouldn&#39;t exaggerate that. I&#39;m disappointed."
The only thing I do not like about Samsung is the battery life on all of theirs phones. I have the Galaxy S6 and the battery is terrible.
"It&#39;s not JIF, it&#39;s GIF. Why?<br><br>Graphics<br>Interchange<br>Format<br><br>You don&#39;t say Jraphics, you say Graphics."
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MotoXPure"">#MotoXPure</a>"

Thanks to those ads I&#39;m never gonna buy or use dBrand.

"First of all Samsung is ip68, and second get the exynos version and you won&#39;t have any lags and longer battery!"
D a iphone 7 plus vs note 7

I changed mine but it didn&#39;t come with the green battery. I go to the website and it says i have a good phone. How can I get the green battery??
Are you getting the V20 anytime soon?
"Great review, the audio was a bit echoed thou."
Are you going to do a pixel expectations vid? <br>Since the event is in 6 days
You mean IP-68
This dbrand shit is getting really annoying.
ayy man whers that joker shirt from?
My headphones emphasize the hi hats too much. Every time I hear someone say something with the letter &quot;S&quot; Its followed with a whistle. Pls halo.



The best camera? My G4 chuckled a bit.

Is my note 7 the only that has 3.3 gb of ram?

Hey tell me a iPhone 7plus review
"Just curious... I have an &quot;old&quot; Note 7 and want to swap it in, but I&#39;ve not been overly impressed. How soon is the LG V20 review coming out? I know you are only one man and such, but I&#39;d like a phone that if it got a dud battery I could actually do something about it and I really like your reviews."
nice vid but theres still some echo in the voice over
this phone is fire 😩😩🔥🔥💥
"I did fly last week ago and when at the plain it was ready for people to use their phones they said &quot;Except Samsung Galaxy Note 7&quot;, WTF!"
"this video is uploaded one day ago ,I&#39;m waiting for next video from mkbhd to make sure he is save"

should I get this an iPhone 7 plus or wait for galaxy s8

"Why no one is mentioning new Gorilla glass on note7. Man, that phone is super durable."
"I have the Note 4, I&#39;ve babied it with a case and screen protector since I got it so it is like-new condition, is there any point in upgrading when my contract is up in December?"
dat like to dislike ratio tho
Yo is there a link for that wallpaper?
I was unsold at &quot;lag&quot;
I still use galaxy note 2😭
google pixel!!!!!!!!!!! YAYAYAYAYAYAYAAy
Best phone in the world. I like the simple ability to press the power button and then slide to unlock the phone. Something no Apple product can do anymore.
pls make a rip  video for BB10 os &amp;  blackberry passport.
Good job pronouncing gif! Happy<br>to see someone do it right
duudee *Gif.
That shirt! Where can I get it?!
Wow this review just exploded into my sub box ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I just exchanged ny Note 7 and my battery icon isn&#39;t green. Can i change that setting? I did the samsung check and it said the new phone is good to go.
Lagdroid



"Thanks MKBHD!  I have been waiting so long for your review that, I end up not buying the Note 7... 😂😂"
my note 4 sounds great!!! speaker is the best...
how do u play that marshmallow game on note 5?
it&#39;s crazy that a headphone jack will now be mentioned as a feature...
Boom！
hey marques what shirt is that i love it
I have one question your T-shirt where I can find it ?
What an android fan you are. Everything is best on this phone when you know it&#39;s not
"Did any one else see the Bragi app? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tease"">#tease</a>"

watching on my iPhone 7+ ;););)
MKBHD be the type of nigga to get 2 Note 7s just so that one can have a Dbrand skin and the other not.
"He is getting sloppy, this review is like a month and a half late and did he just say &#39;IP 67&#39; instead of IP 68 come on man. step up your game"

A great phone display screen wasn&#39;t convincing for me<br>Yesterday i had to wipe off the phone data (factory restore) after my defected note 7 stopped responding and the battery temperature slowly start to rise <br>I did it after i pressed all the buttons at the same time <br>Disconnecting the phone battery is very important for any sealed system the consumer should have full control over the power source of any device... they can simply add a physical switch that can do the job  internally <br>Sometimes the phone can freeze and stop responding to any function including the power button <br>Coming from the excellent samsung s3 i say closed system phones are not practical in the long run<br>I think I&#39;m going toward the lg v20 this year
Wallpaper?
Long time watcher....Love my note 7. Props on the Tesla bro. It looks SICK!!!!!!!!
good video
Well said my friend.
Subscribe me :)
"bad speaker kills it for me, and I would probably have to root and flash it, which I don&#39;t really want to do...  Everything else looks beastly, beautiful design when you hold it.  Big phone, but doesn&#39;t feel over sized."
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m34s"">1:34</a> Ah, the memories he brought back when he said he was &quot;holding it wrong&quot; lol."
Samsung photos are too saturated and too much post processing for my liking
Your a bit late man
"Finally something positive, and that addresses the battery issue. Ohh... and that crispyness!"
So are you more into glass or metal built phones. Do you think all phones should all phones from other phone maker&#39;s go glass.
Honor 8  review
Great review! I&#39;m still buying my note 7!
"i am almost, but not completely sure if he said &quot;dshif&quot; as a joke or not"
make an apartment tour
Is the Note 7 / edge unlocked globally? Or is it locked to the carrier you subscribe to.
That elephant in the room ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
The only bad thing is i heard the battery is 150 ma smaller than the &quot;exploding&quot; model.
wallpaper?🙄
"Really good and honest review, dude.... I personally think that in other reviews of the note 7, too much focus was given on the battery explosions than the phone itself. But your review rocks... 👍👍👍 Well done."
I must have this baby!
Great review! I loved the photos.

Is it legal to review BOMB in YouTuve?
Where&#39;d you get the shirt?!?
Camera better than the iPhone?
When the flight attendant asks you to turn down your note 7.. your reply should be &quot; But is it against the law though..&quot;
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuck that piece of shit! Samsung is way down with this mess.
Good luck explaining the green battery to the TSA
Where did you get that T shirt🙌🏼👍🏻? I love the Joker
Nice T-Shirt Marques ..!!
The t-shirt!!! 😱😍
This phone is da bomb!
watching this on my note 7
Will there be a giveaway?
Why is this review so late?
"Ugh, want this phone, but need it unlocked"
Screen so good you can see the explosions coming out the phone
lol after so many explosions the best phone of the year is here.
you didn&#39;t mention expandable memory and cool shirt. where can I get that at?  thumbs up.
That ball of headphones though.
"@MKBHD few users said new note 7 after bug improvement, they still get pretty hot while charging or using and battery gets drain fast. it is true?"
"Ayyee <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamjif"">#teamjif</a>"
great phone...<br>now about that flight ban...😕😔😟😞😢😭
can&#39;t believe it lags. will wait for October 4th Google event and decide if I get note or pixel.
Hey MKB didn&#39;t have it explode in his in hand! No hospitalization required!
"I think he kinda messed up cuz i think its IP68, now I gotta go check it"
Explosions - the only thing Samsung copied from Apple while apple is copying everything from Android &amp; Co.
berry life has been great one mine I had been waiting a while to get excited about a phone now  <br>the note 7 has gave me hope.
in my opinion the battery sucks
how much is dbrand paying for being mentioned in EVERY phone video?
Thanks... very good review 👍
Imagine telling a flight attendant you have one of the new note 7s<br><br>&quot;Sir turn your phone off it might explode&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s okay I have one of the new and safe ones&quot;<br><br><b>Beaten and immediately detained on suspicion of terrorism</b><br><br>And it would probably be on United too. United sucks
Pretty sure it&#39;s IP68 certified. Unless that&#39;s been been changed somehow in the safe Note 7.
<b>muffled boom</b>
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m21s"">3:21</a> thats a MKBHD tesla !!  :-)"
"Yo, I want to commend you my friend for giving a honest , non bias, samsung bashing review. You could have easily swayed many  people by simply advising them to steer away from Samsung phones. The same unfortunate events could happen to apple, LG, or motorola. Being that I haven&#39;t upgraded my phone since the G2, which is what I am still using today, I was considering buying this phone until the unthinkable happen,  although expensive. Now, after seeing your video I may reconsider. But what do you think about the Miu 5s plus and the UMI plus? Can you do a review of those phones? They have great specs and half the price of ios/american android phones. Thanks.<br>Will"
Great video and review! I hope whenever it is released you do an LG V20 Review too!
S7Edge = super phone <br>Note 7 = portable office <br><br>IPhone 7= phone <br>IPhone7plus = the same but... More bigger

it was released a couple of weeks ago? dude.. it was over a month ago. get real.

That apple earphone ball from Jonathan charity.
"I have got Samsung Galaxy Alpha, and yes... I need to charge it twice a day..."
No question. Note 7 is the best phone! The whole recall scenario will hurt them and that was very unfortunate. I did get a new note 7 and I love it!
My moto Z force is better 😎
Nice bundle of earpods
this exploding businesses is just planned obsolescence backfiring

hey MKBHD wheres your tee from?
The Note 7 is one of the best phones out there (Probably even the best one) and its so underrated because of this one issue that has already been fixed.
"@mkbhd I have seen all your videos, but this tops them all. It&#39;s just a beautiful video in all aspects! Great job!"

Didn&#39;t they cripple the Verizon version?

Whatup with the deployable shield in the background?
Why do you never review Sony Xperia phones? They are pretty awesome looking at specs and price
Note 4 user. Been waiting 2 years now...Going to upgrade as soon as the new batches of Note 7s come in. ALL POWER TO THE DROIDS! 😀
Shit phone. It&#39;s a liability lol. Wait for the Pixel.
I think I travelled  In time I passed windows  9 and note 6
Curious what your thoughts are on when to charge it (at what percent)
awesome.........but i don&#39;t have the budget for this beast....can i go for s6 edge instead??
expandable storage
Can&#39;t be faster than HTC 10 which goes 0 to 100 in 40 minutes and it doesn&#39;t explode!
about time

폭발 사고만 아니였으면 정말 괜찮은 폰으로 많은 사랑을 받았을텐데... 역대 나온 휴대폰중 최고의 좆망폰이 되어버렸네요.ㅜㅠ
RIP iPhone 7
And Explosion XD.
So is it IP67 or IP68?
"ip68, not ip67"
&quot;You&#39;re holding it wrong&quot;
what&#39;s the geekbench score? at par with iphone 7?
399 and in a few days I shall have my snapdragon 820 super mega device oneplus 3!
didn&#39;t realize they had fixed it
just 3 hours of high brightness usage?!?!!? I&#39;m constantly getting 7 hours of screen on time on my s7 edge. Always on auto-brightness and thus very bright...Only about an hour SOT is done at bedtime with around 15% brightness(still automatic). Heck...I get comfortable 5 hours of SOT with all day max. brightness use...S7 edge Exynos.
"Been using a Note 4 for the last few years, and I think the Note 7 is the upgrade I&#39;ve been waiting for. All the local stores have the new batches in but are only selling to previous Note 7 customers who were waiting for replacements. Makes sense. I don&#39;t mind waiting a couple more weeks, looks like a gorgeous phone."

Explosive review
There was a report recently that some guys note 7 caught fire about a day ago.. and it was his replacement phone. it&#39;s all online but it&#39;s kinda hard to believe... anyways it was in China BTW
"Major disappointment! I did not expect MKBHD to say something as stupid as &quot;I&#39;m holding it wrong, it&#39;s my bad&quot; and than to pronounce GIF as JIF... I&#39;m so so so disappointed - you too are becoming one of them biased reviewers who we can&#39;t trust! Get your shit together please!"
Did he just say the iris scanner is less secure than other methods?

what where u doing in maryland
"Thank you for explaining everything to me Marques. Unfortunately mine was stolen but I was able to buy a note 5 on CL. I&#39;m still waiting for mine to come in and yes the camera is AWESOME especially for me. I go to a lot of concerts here in the Bay area and talk about professional quality photo&#39;s ? WOW it&#39;s awesome.  Now far as the explosion? I didn&#39;t have the problem at all with the one that was stolen. I&#39;d rather have this phone than an apple any day... ... Now my question to you  is can my phone be unlocked if I had the eye scan on, password and google password?"
lovely
"I don&#39;t really care about waterproof. Hey samsung ! If you want to sell more than iphone make it shatter proof, smudge proof &amp; scratch proof. I would like to use my expensive phone without a case."
"best phone 2016, when not exploding of course. I have mine and it has no problem whatsoever after 1 month of use, still waiting for the replacement unit"
I thought Hillary won last night. What yall think?

Should I wait to see how the note 8 and iPhone 8 gonna be like for just cop note 7
this video was fire
Whats the difference between the dji mavic pro and the phantom 4
Awesome review as always but you missed the new cleaner software part :(
Was that art piece in the background made by @robot?
marques is racist..haha
that apple in-ear phone phone stand though
my is jafar<br>i come from afar<br>there&#39;s a note 7 in my car<br>allu ackbar
which would u suggest to buy the galaxy note 7 or i phone 7plus?
"I returned my Note 7 and was going to get it again but AT&amp;T basically screwed up my exchange because A &amp; B weren&#39;t talking.<br><br>Now I have the new ASUS ZenFone 3 Deluxe with the Snapdragon 821, and I couldn&#39;t be more happier.  too bad, I would have still gotten the Note 7 again."

It is IP68 Certified
I love your shirt
"Snap or exynos is so freaggin slow compared to iphone 7 a10. The ufs 2.0 is also so slow compared to iphone&#39;s nvme. I do not understand why this phone is being compared with iphone7, iphone destroys this phone. I wont even talk about exploding battery. The new &#39;fixed&#39; ones now have rapid drain problem. The brand itself is crap"
it&#39;s ip68 not ip67
And... explosions. That made me laugh :))
Will the exploding ones be super cheap? I mean 100 phones is nothing considering how many they sold/produced. I&#39;d def buy one without a worry.
"Best display, best camera lol poor iSheep."
Honer 8 Note
"Dat echo.  Btw,  I don&#39;t really like this video style with voice overs.  I like your old style!"

"I am a first time Samsung user. My last phone was Nexus 4. I just got the Note 7 and I love it, but I have one issue. Whenever I take a screenshot or download any picture, it saves in the camera roll. Anyone know how to fix this?"
when it blows up does it leave you crisper than a kfc 12 piece
Did samsung paid extra for this review ??
Lol... Note 7 looks like S7 in your hands... 😁
my battery lasts 1day and a half....you gotta a lot of draining apps possibly
"you can be an iPhone fan or Android , but you have to admit galaxy phones have the best camera&#39;s 👌"
A phone that explodes. Yes please
Thanks for the update. Loved the smoke at the end FUNNY!
"I don&#39;t think I will ever buy a phone without fast charging ever again. it&#39;s such an awesome feature, it&#39;s just an absolute must at this point."
All the way up! Anyone elso?
Hey Marques where did you get that t-shirt from
"Samsung Galaxy Note 7.  The phone of choice for Jihadis, ISIS and all other explosive personalities!"
Are you just slowly rotating when holding these phones?
"Hahahh! The ball of earpiece <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m16s"">7:16</a>"
"great video as always. For me  the battery life on the note 7 is much better than the S7 edge but maybe that&#39;s because I&#39;m not as much of a power user as I once thought. lol. <br><br>also I luckily did not have any issues getting a replacement S7 edge. we&#39;ll see how the swap back to a note 7 goes, though."
"My old one never overheated while charging, under heavy Usage or both at the same time. But I replaced it anyway. The new is as good as the old one. So I am really enjoying the phone right now and nothing else in the world would make me change my mind. You need to have one to really see all the goodness packed into this phone. I can talk about it for ever but I&#39;ll let you find out on your own.<br>Note series for life!"
take a short tour in my channel❤❤
"Great review, always amazing video quality.  your the best!"
IP68 or IP68?

my internet sucks so I have to watch this in 240p . i feel like I&#39;m being disrespectful
quit watching when he said jif. NEXT REVIEWER PLS
Art is an explosion!
FUCKING JIFFERS !!! <br><br>No offence MKBHD
dude great review
love the review man great job
"thanks marques for making this video , really people were taking this battery exploding to a really weird level ,, yes there was some mistake somewhere with samsung but because of that you can not just start saying stupid things and making fun of the best android phone available out there , also samsung is doing everything to make things right  ...."
"A powerusers phone? <br>No swappable battery. No IR. Glassback. Same specs as the S7...<br>So no, it&#39;s not a powerusers phone anymore. <br><br>Looks at LG v20... living in Europe..."

what watch band are you wearing +MarquesBrownlee
You took this phone on a plane! 💣
Samsung REALLY needs those upgrade those phone speakers. They always make &#39;em so small...
Song at the start?
"hey MKBHD,   could you please share a link for the T-shirt you are wearing here??<br>just awesome☺️☺️"
"Please could you review the Xiaomi Mi5s when, and if, you get your hands on it"
Was kind of hoping he would start the video wearing a helmet
When did Marques turn into a brand ambassador of Samsung???😱
fuck this shit
Who else is watching this on an IPhone 6S?
how many ear pods were used in that ball of ear pods?
It explodes and all . . . . still better than new I phone lol
"daang that black one is sick AF. I have the Note 5 and this makes me wanna upgrade. Great review bro, don&#39;t pay attention to the haters, i wish I could see them make a review as good quality as yours without stuttering. hahaha"
did you really get a steam machine for the explosion bit? :O
Can I use third party battery?
THAT apple headphone&quot;&quot;s&quot;&quot; spool what was that all about ???? :O
You should review the new Xiaomi mi5s<br><br>PD: you videos are pure quality
"The green battery is exploding(and other issues like cannot charge over 10%, etc) too, what chu wanna say now? Samsung should better refund all Note 7 and focus on S8 since if they do another recall or something, it&#39;s gonna take a lot of money again."
Hey mkbhd what are you wearing on your arm wrist?
"I&#39;m so happy that I finally have a internet good enough to see ur videos in 4k! It&#39;s amazing... such a good video quality, beyond the contend for sure"
finally d review
where do you get your t-shirts?
iphone 7 vs note 7 please
"im still in love with my s7, no edges and pens but still with great features, good for people with small hands and smaller budget ;)"
"Meh, V20 is better IMO, no more crapsung"



Iphone 7 plus review please
How come your camera doesn&#39;t lag?? Every time I buy a samsung my camera is like laggy af.
Another Late but Fantastic Review...<br>Hands down!!!!<br> But Waiting for iPhone 7 Plus Review ;)
"exynos 8890, not snapdragon"
The Galaxy Note 7: Big Bang Edition
"The green battery though , why can and theyd dismay kda battery icon red on the bad ones"
"Samsung makes the best Hardware. No competition. The touchwiz on top of open system android, makes these phones slow overtime and not as simple to use like ios. Apple makes easy to use light closed system software which can be more easier to learn for everyone."
you mean ip68 not ip67 get it right dude thumbs down for me on this review 🖓
"Best review in a long time, congrats!"
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a> you said its ip67"
The quality of the video is amazing!
dude luv your reviews
Where have I heard your holding it wrong before?
"Got to use this phone for a week before my friend sent his old one back, pretty decent phone. <br>I still think I would take an S7 Edge over it, since here in Canada we have the Exynos chip, it lasts WAY longer than this beast.<br>Not a huge fan of the amount of curve on the S7 screen, but the battery makes it tolerable."
your vids are always full screen worthy to watch.
"Watch out, might explode"
Dat ball of headphones!
Keep it water cooled  so it does not blow up
It&#39;s new yet there&#39;s already lag (as mentioned by MKBHD) hmmmmmm that&#39;s not good isn&#39;t it. <br><br>Anyhow. There are articles out there stating battery safety issues even with the replaced batch. Note 7 users please honestly practice caution.
you make a mistake you said note 7 is ip67 but its ip68
JIF?!!?!? UNSUBBED.
Youre Videos have such a awesome quality... Beautiful to watch! What Camera do you use?
"what took so long with the review? You used to be quick and at the forefront when it came to all things Android. You did an iPhone hype video, impressions video, and unboxing video. We finally get a Note 7 review almost 2 months after the impressions video."
your T-shirt is looking good
I&#39;m hearing the new batch of Note 7s are having issues also?<br><br>Any update?
Cool review.  Curious how you feel the V20 stacks up against it.
People are on here fusing about the iPhone being better or the Galaxy s being better but if you think one is better why would you have to argue about it if you already know why argue if you know you have the better phone because it makes you sound like you don&#39;t so you have to argue about it
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m00s"">5:00</a> you wear contacts? Do you have a vid of you wearing glasses?"
"How did u snap these two <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m26s"">3:26</a> &amp; <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m34s"">3:34</a>  pics!!!!"
"You need to take better care about your timing, MKB! This phone almost doesn&#39;t really matter much to anybody now."
"An incredible phone, without the battery of course."
"Great review as always Marques, keep up the good work! A few things though. <br><br>1. This is most likely a bug with Samsungs aggressive power management features when the device is locked. They majorly downclick the CPU in order to save battery life. The problem by doing this is if a computational task is already going on when you&#39;re unlocking the phone, it will lag until the unlock process completes and up-clocks the processor to typical levels. Samsung is probably more aggressive with this on the Note because of it&#39;s smaller battery. You&#39;ve probably noticed it with a handful of Android devices. <br><br>2. I&#39;m guessing that you&#39;re writing this review before the water-resistant iPhone came out. But the speakers on the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are amazing with water-resistant speakers. So at least in my opinion, the lower, tinny sound from the S7, S7 Edge, and Note are no excuse at this point."
its iphonejetblack clone samsang note 7 hahahahhahahahahahahahahah
"This marks the end of apple because samsung is making phones that are better than ever and apple just released the iphone 7 that is actually worse than the iphone 6. So i think that if ur an iphone user or u wanted one, u should probably changed to samsung  from samsung because its just overall a better phone."



"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a> it is IP 68 rated, IPhone 7 is IP 67 rated, it makes a pretty big difference, but nice review"

Lowkey not hearing a word you say. Just watching beautiful visuals
"I&#39;m sad for this phone and the problems that is having. I always hated Samsung&#39;s designs, they were all the same and not appealing but man... Note 7 must be the best looking phone out there, at least to me with some competition from Chinese ones. Too bad it&#39;s exploding everywhere."
"New Subscriber! I have to say, you being a man of color and a tech guy caused me to subscribe to you!! 👍🏾👍🏾"
"thank u for ur videos it really help, keep up bro."
"Pretty sure it&#39;s IP68 not IP67. The iPhone is IP67. Great review though, I love my note 7."
"stop being such an ignorant fanatic person. we are all good. fuh<br><br>IP68, isn&#39;t it? NM.."
Great video especially in 1440p! Sorry iPhone users maybe next year Tim crook will let you have a QHD Samsung display. Till then you can enjoy his gun free iBezel 🔫😂😂

"Screen and speakers are the most important thing for me, so the nexus is my go to"
My name is jafar<br>I come from afar<br>There is a note 7 in my car<br>Alluh Akbar
you can make gifs of youtube videos but I can&#39;t take a screenshot :(
I got it when it first came out but the screen cracked and now they wont let me trade in it for one that doesnt explode.
I use to like your videos. But now they&#39;re even beter :&#39;) keep up the good work
i was really looking forward to Note 7 but after the explosion thing i don&#39;t know...i live in a place with a very hot weather and a bright sun so...yeah even if you tell me it&#39;s fixed i&#39;m kinda worried about something blowing up on my hands or returning to my room to see it burnt...now i&#39;m thinking to get the iphone 6s instead as it will become cheaper...what do you think guys?    P.S i have note 3
"...and a headphone jack, of course... lol"
"Hey Marcus, love your vids, but I have a request.<br>Could you please include what is the decibel output of the speakers in your future reviews?<br>I hate that all phones now have very weak speakers and I can&#39;t hear the ringing when I&#39;m on a loud meetings (partys). I am asking this now because I expect you would make your review of the new google pixel and weak speakers are a deal breaker for me if there is no ip68."
"that&#39;s one sexy looking phone, but I&#39;ll stick with my 6p 😎"
does anyone know where he got his shirt from?
Beautifull !
never buy first batch product
Why are you always complaining about the speakers? Noone uses them! Headphones or Bluetooth Speakers all day! Only time you explaing the speaker is if it doesnt ring loud enough lol
When is your iphone 7 plus review coming? @mkbhd
Note series screen is so delicate that you might damage it with slight more press. And it&#39;s not covered under warranty. I suffered same in just one month with Note 5.
please make a Q/A video and tell that when did you started getting sponsered and your sponsership story
"MKBHD as per Samsung, it&#39;s ingress protection rating is IP68."
Cool t-shirt
"you missed to show one thing, how it explodes..."
Samsung is lucky one of these did not blow up in a VR head set.
wallpaper?
Your t-shirt!  Where can I get that?
You&#39;re the best MB
Great review
Thought it was ip68 rated?
So note 4 is still the best note?
"mehhhh, dislike the smaller battery..."

The MKBHD Magic Is Back
guys!! should I buy this or should I buy the C4 instead???!!
attention plzz ... explode
Oh I was waiting for so long for this. But the phone comes out next month here anyway.
The Xperia Z5 has great speakers and is waterproof...
"Great review! I know the US don&#39;t get many Sony devices but to make a point to your water resistant comment in the video, Sony have been making water resistant devices for the past 4-5 years now without there handsets looking or feeling bulky, they did need flaps till recently but they definitely started the trend"
worth the wait.
im watching this on 1440p Can your iphone 7 do that <br>no bitch
Samsung: Note 7 battery failure/ Explody phone = Recall<br><br>Apple: iPhone 6 plus bendy phone = nothing























note 8 should be twice as thicc with all the extra space taken up by battery
why so late?
Can you link the shirt you&#39;re wearing? +mkbhd
"Pixel Launcher at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m14s"">5:14</a>?"
what took you so long marques :P. Finally :D. Video done justice !
iPhone 7 plus or Samsung galaxy note 7
"Bruh, what are you smoking. The Xperia Z5 has a 4k display and 23. Mp camera. Note 7 doesn&#39;t have the best display or camera on any smart phone lol not even close, what are you smoking~"
"Ahh man great camera work @ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=0m46s"">0:46</a>"
Where can I get that shirt?!? 😱
JIF! UNSUBSCRIBED
Waiting for the Nexus/Pixel
love your t-shirt!
marques please dont ever change your introductory song to all your vids. ever. it da bomb
Waiting for MKBHD Review of any windows phone especially HP Elite X3
"I bought the Galaxy S7 Edge, and absolutely loved the hell out of it. Apparently someone else did as well, and it got stolen by a pickpocket. I was wondering about getting the same one as a replacement, but now I&#39;m wondering about the Note. <br>Is the pen and slightly larger screen worth the reduced battery life and overheating issues?"
From where you got that t shirt?
"the best camera in a smartphone..BASED ON YOUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. thats highly dbatable. you also have the lg v20, the huawei p9 with its dual LEICA camera setup, reviews like this tend to be very misleading because the note 7 camera isnt perfect, even tho it takes great photos on the fly, it depends on the situation(lighting etc). I got mine a week ago and honestly its still a toss up between this and the lg g5 and huawei p9 for me"
What internet do you have? Speeds are above 100 Mbits!
how about the overheating issues and slow charging times on QC2.0 on the replacement phones?
MKBHD is an ANDROID Fan !
Marques have you considered getting involved in a ROM development? Your attention to details is great. I&#39;d definitely download or even pay for the ROM.
I wish you would make more frequent videos
Great phone! I think I&#39;ll send one (pre-recall) to my ex-wife!
A very explosive review...
so let&#39;s help each other subscribe comment done and i will sub back thank&#39;s !
nice sir...
"I have this phone and I absolutely love it. Best phone ever. My friends all made fun of me for having the &quot;explosion phone&quot; at first but hey, products get recalled all the time. It really wasn&#39;t a big deal to me."






please review LG V20!!
Great video!!! And review!!!!!
Is it just me or was marques talking faster than usual in this video?
where did you get this shirt?
What&#39;s the blast radius though
"I like your reviews, you rly talk about things and don&#39;t try to hide em. I have the edge although the curves are beautiful, the usability is terrible, you have to manage your grip or the display won&#39;t respond. That&#39;s the only problem i see and it seems the Note has a slightly small curves, i&#39;d say that is a big improvement :p"
S7&gt;note7
set up tour pleaseee
booooom run nigga ruuun 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I don&#39;t give a damn if this phone gon blow me away <br>.<br>I&#39;m not buying iPhone anyway

"I was just thinking about explosion then the video reaches <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=8m42s"">8:42</a> ~"
Usually ur late but it&#39;s ok.  But DAMMMMMMM!  YOU LATE BRO!



did you ever feel scared about the exploding knowing that you have the new version which is SAID to be safe?
Lol even though the benchmark shows iPhone 7 is 40% faster
"Where he get that dope shirt!?,"
do a giveaway plsssss
This mobile battery gonna blast the world
"Marques, are you experiencing the phone over-heating?"
"&quot;The new points of the Galaxy note 7 are the design refresh, some camera improvements, a bunch of new software features and explosions&quot; savage af."
Did anybody else notice the ball of EarPods?




"actually it is iP68 not iP67 man , awesome video tho"
ur review 👌
why do you never make reviews of Xperia smartphones.. Xperia XZ is out now


"LIKE MY PHOTOGRAPHY PAGE!!! I FOLLOW ALL OF YOU WHO LIKE MY PAGE : <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LeoHodzicsphotography/"">https://www.facebook.com/LeoHodzicsphotography/</a>"
"Note7 is IP68 certified for dust and water resistance, not IP67"
bruh this exploded do you not read
When will Samsung get rid of the snapdragon processors? they&#39;re trash af!
It is IP68
"I have always been an apple person. I had the iPhone 4, 5, &amp; 6. I switched over to the Note 7 a week before they announced the recall. I actually really love this phone. I plan on trading it in for the new &quot;safe&quot; Note 7 that Samsung is replacing them with. I&#39;m not sure if I will ever go back to iPhone because I love it THAT much. I have the blue Note 7 by the way : )"
How do I know mine is green battery any suggestions like Lirum info
IP 68 not IP 67
"Ip68,  not IP 67..."
its IP68 bro.. iPhone 7 is IP67
"Its Graphical Interchange Format, not Jraphical Interchange Format. Gif, not Jif."
You should make a Note 7 vs S7 video!
please make a video that shows blasting of this phone while in idle state :P
pls do a review of lg v20
it&#39;s a bomb😂😂😂
Is this a bomb review? Oh sorry wrong video.

Samsung sucker

great as always... keep up Marques
And you know what. LG G3 still have a better pixel density
How are the speakers on this phone?
It&#39;s ip68 btw lol
"I used to love his channel.  There isn&#39;t really anything special about it anymore.  His reviews come later than everyone else&#39;s, and by the time he does publish them we basically know everything about the phones already (aside from the fact that he got the IP certification number wrong in this one).  Yes, the camera quality in his vids are good, but so are most YouTube tech reviewers nowadays.  Should we should expect his LG V20 review some time in January?  Let&#39;s go, Marques.  You were the top tech reviewer on YouTube for good reason.  You stood out.  Now some clown who bent an iPhone is labeled as the top tech reviewer."






















I knew you would say explosions in the beginning XD
Can we have a Moto g4 review?
"It&#39;s funny how Apple vs. Android comments will never end. Rarely hear a mention jailbroken iPhones in those arguments or software people prefer to use on either system, or that they are TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN! It very vaguely reminds me of religion vs science... both are looking to do the same thing (find the truth). Except religions can be a bit &quot;out there.&quot; Science prefers to physically go &quot;out there&quot; and find the truth the hard way (nothing worth accomplishing is easy)"
LOL I just came from Waffle House
"Excellent review, Marcus, but what took you so long to do one?"
"T Shirt Link <a href=""http://shop.facets.la/collections/all"">http://shop.facets.la/collections/all</a>"
So it is finally returned !!
I love your shirt.
is the Note 7 still worth getting once the new batch comes out? or skip it entirely. kinda dig that coral blue variant before the recall even came out.
"I find it strange that Samsung are going against material design guidelines by making the battery indicator green, Google says that it must be white."
Dig the shirt!
Disappointed that the galaxy A9 series will never reach the U.S. :/
Nice bud ball
Too bad US have SD820 variant. Somehow Exynos has las lag
"good review, thx dude!!"
"Your videos are great, man! Really cool!"
Apple fans be like ... Shit we have a duel lens and still Samsung kicked our ass
"i just forwaded the boring video of boring phone, did he mention u r holding a granade in hand while holding it,it exploded for people around the world."
Link to buy the T Shirt anyone?
cuidao que no te explote bro
Why re all MKBHDs comment sections so utterly ghastly in every way. Like can someone write a funny original and intelligent comment? Is that beyond the minds of everyone in this video?
Marques  throw it away its a FUCKING GRENADE!!!!!!😂😂😂
awesome review 😎
Damn! He is super sleek with his videos!
"I have an S Pen,<br>I have a Note,<br>Ugh,<br>Allahu Akbar."
"It will EXPLODE, runnnnnn!!!!!!!!"
please do what&#39;s on my smartphone.
This phone really is the bomb!
Wallpaper?
Look it up.<br>It&#39;s pronounced JIF
how do ypu get the camera to go full screen??
LG V20 review coming??
"This was an explosive review. Great work. I&#39;m on the iPhone 7 for now, but this thing has been teasing me for months. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll hop over eventually. That is, assuming the Pixel is disappointing. <br><br>Also, I&#39;m glad you say GIF right. I like GIFs and giraffes."










wallpaper ?!
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m22s"">7:22</a> sneak diss"
nice T shirt bro !!!
He is wearing my desktop wallpaper :D
<b>Elephant in the Room</b>
"wooow, good timing 👍"
I dont even understand why my s7 is so laggy especially when im in the messaging and camera app its laggy.
"It is not a JIF, it&#39;s a freaking GIF! Shame on you Marques :)"
is it safe to buy now?
gif gif gif gif
No opinions on Grace UI / UX? Is a genuine major selling point too me that noone has really looked into :(
"OMG dude! I mean, I respect you and all, love your content... but... are you really team .jif ?? Please tell me this is a one time deal or something! On the real side of things, great video, I like how you handled the &quot;explosive&quot; nature of that review, well done!"






where did you get that shirt from!!! omg it&#39;s so cool! also a reply would literally make my day :))
nice video again marq
the beast is back @MKBHD where did you get the tshirt😂?
"Well done, Samsung. Well done."
get ready for the boom!
nice review...
where can I get that shirt?
Another awesome review broham
"Idk, the Note 7 peforms slower than S7/ S7 edge. Or atleast to me."
I didn&#39;t like the explosions feature. So it&#39;s a 9/10 for me.
@mkbhd great video! Why do you use the nexus 6p instead of the note 7 as your daily driver?
MKBHD always has great wallpapers on his phones. 👌👌
A lot of people like to Argue APPLE or SAMSUNG. But numbers don&#39;t lie. APPLE sells more phones for a single company. Its the #1 phone company in the world. Look guys Samsung is good but its just another Android. HTC is better honestly. Samsung major problem is they went with Android instead of doing their own things like apple did. Androids are quantity over quality. And that&#39;s what i hate about ANDROID.
"C&#39;mon man, we already settled this. GIF is a hard G. Also - about the camera, how does it compare against a Nexus 6P?"
"This is Time Bomb :P, heard it explodes... :/"
Did he just pronounce Gif as &quot;jif&#39; UNSUB!!! xD
This review was rather exploding...
Why&#39;d you not include video taken from 7?
"Snapchat fam   <del>---</del>&gt;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=8m27s"">8:27</a>"
"I have been a iPhone user since the original iPhone. Galaxy s7 made me go over to Samsung, imo they make the best smartphones atm. you could argue that some features are better on iPhone and I would agree but overall the Samsung phones own right now! even with iPhone 7 bering out."
There is no doubt. This is best looking phone in the market. I am not  into Touchwhiz. It&#39;s not as coherent as stock android or iOS.
"I would get this, even after the issue of exploding battery. However, I have the Note 5, and I don&#39;t see the need for it. <br><br>Great review!"





I&#39;m surprised it didn&#39;t explode while you were recording this video.

















Where&#39;s the Iphone review? It&#39;s been out 2 weeks
how much does it cost?
He said Jif <b>*TRIGGERED*</b>
Me and my father went to Samsung store (here we don&#39;t have carriers every phone we get is unlocked) and they don&#39;t have a note7 they say we have to wait until December
IP68 certified instead of 67
"why don&#39;t you say about phone network of every smartphone review. like  wifi band,speed test of strong network, i think you solve this problem your video is much watching then other youtuber.So i hope you will understand my view point,, So keep it up..........!!!!!!!!MKBHD is genuine youtuber on earth&quot;........!!!!!!!"
"It would be helpful if you were to make an video dedicated to educating the main stream about how to distinguish a safe Note 7 from the rest.  I&#39;d like to be able to use my safe Note 7 on a plane, but I have the feeling airline attendants wouldn&#39;t know about the green battery icon, they would likely just tell me to shut it off anyway."
😍
thumbs up for mkbhd
weak speaker and battery for such a large and expensive phone.





































great real review
Aside from the explosions this is the first Samsung phone I genuinely want alot
"Risky phone <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamiphone"">#teamiphone</a>"
F**k Samsung. I hope they never recover from this whole fire thing. HTC all the way





"IT&#39;S CONFIRMED, HE SAID GIF AS &quot;JIF&quot;. That&#39;s the way to pronounce it folks."
i h8 that samsung icon on front
well I guess it&#39;s a blown up version of the s7
i h8 that samsung icon on front
Lol your Intro music getting Old          you should change it ;)
Note 7 or iPhone 7? Which do you prefer for everyday use
How 2 b koolz: <br>1) Buy note 7<br>2) Charge it<br>3) Put on sunglasses<br>4) Turn around<br>5) Walk away slowly











Damn you late as hell with this review... it&#39;s already been on fire!!
U finally did it !
Bumble on the recommended apps hmmmm
ip68***
"I have the new new Samsung galaxy note 7 I love it, I can&#39;t stop using it"
"This is getting real boring now, considering how every Phone these days looks the same and has the same specs"
what wallpaper is that on the phone?
"I Enjoy your videos, but you said &quot;JIF&quot; ... why have you done that...? Gonna have a new tech guy ."
Are we just gonna ignore the fact that MKBHD said IP67? The Note 7 is actually IP68!
Note7 is a beast and it&#39;s actually ip68 certified this year
Are you going to review the Apple watch series 2?
Where did you get that sweet shirt?
why was he even holding i phone 7 plus and note 7 side by side?!
why was he even holding i phone 7 plus and note 7 side by side?!
Note 7 - ultimate terrorist weapon
"As always, very informative. Thanks."
Thank you for this explosive review.
"probably one of the best devices I&#39;ve ever owned. Only a few changes I&#39;d make:<br><br>PAINT THE METAL WHERE THE GLASS MEETS IT THE LIGHT BLEED ON THE BLUE ONE IS UNACCEPTABLE<br><br>seriously it&#39;s got two streaks running parallel to the screen that can be seen in a lot of light situations of the screen is above 50% and always is visible in low light no matter what the brightness is THIS IS AN 850 DOLLAR PHONE SAMSUNG HOW DID YOU MISS THAT <br><br>Copy Moto and Apple with the top firing front facing speaker<br><br>physical camera button<br><br>refine the software dramatically<br><br>honestly, I think that they can rest of their laurels as far as design and specs go (same body, 2017 top shelf specs) but they need to put all of their efforts into refining and humanizing their software."
waffle house😂
Wow my computer has 3gb of ram
I&#39;m an iPhone user and I like this phone.  It&#39;s just so sad that it came out with that nasty defect.  Now I&#39;m hearing that the replacements are over heating....so sad. It&#39;s a beautiful devices though!


"T-mobile and Samsung handled the recall amazingly so I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;m holding, at no additional cost, a brand new S7 while I wait for my new Note 7. You also didn&#39;t mention the free gifts that were nothing to sneeze at and I get to claim the S7 free gift as well. I walked in the a local store, the took the old phone and refunded me, called the Note 7 hotline and they sent me the S7 2 days later. Also my boy dropped his note and cracked the display and he&#39;s still allowed to send it back for recall..... unprecedented."
The only thing I miss about my old Galaxy S2 vs my current LG G3 is the old Super AMOLED. It was super vivid &amp; bright!
IP68. You said 67.
"Camera looks nice if the image wasn&#39;t zoomed in. Find it a lil over sharpened, but I still like the camera nonetheless."
And of course I had to pause the video and go check out that drag racing battle shown on the phone.
HE SAYS &quot;JIF&quot;. NO.
400 dislikes coz he said &quot;JIF&quot;
wait wait wait WAIT FOR A SEC!!! You call yourself a tech guy and say JIF? oh nonononono.






























You were using the note 7 on airplane but that was banned from airlines eh?
tee ?
Are you using SnapDragon 820 or Exynos 8890?
"Make a video about rooting and the ROM developing community. These guys are the reason Android is where it is today at the top of the industry with innovation in OS UI, hardware and apps."
Need that tee! Where you got it from?
make another tesla vid/vlog please 😇
"what is the wallpaper at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=4m23s"">4:23</a>.. it looks dope"
love the shirt man
"@MKBHD - Can we talk about how weird the secure folder interface and functionality is? Also, internal file / app storage is weird when using it with an SD card. Why can&#39;t we set the default file path in certain apps to save files or photos on just the SD card? Instead, the only option you seem to be left with is moving them over manually, but if you move folders to the SD card, apps still save files/photos on the internal storage, creating two locations for everything...which can be annoying. Additionally, you can&#39;t remove apps from the device entirely when moving them to the SD card. Every time the app updates, it all migrates back to the internal storage. Why is that?"
dude uve like hypnotized us ....so many views in just 7 hrs.......epic man ..
Awesome. That&#39;s for the review!
"you&#39;re the best youtuber out there we rate you man, you explain the things them so easily  big up from Jamaica #1"
ip68
MKBHD where do you get your shirts from?










"I&#39;m glad to hear someone saying good things about the Note again. Man I hate that whole exploding thing. And what terrible timing. Great review MKBHD, as always!"
"Well said , hit on key points !!"
damn that At&amp;t logo just ruins the aesthetic.
"&quot;Of course we have to address the elephant in the room, you&#39;ve probably been thinking about it this whole review&quot;, <b>auto focus un focuses from elephant</b>"
What Software you use for video editing for your channel ??
man ur late!!
Great review as always! Where did you get that shirt?
Samsung no way Jose
"thanks for making that review wanted to get that phone but my husband wasn&#39;t sold on it because it would be dangerous,so thanks xoxo"
won&#39;t take risks!!!!
Ip 68 😉👍
"Anyone else noticed how he dumped all of his 3.5mm jack iPhone earphones behind the Note 7 at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m16s"">7:16</a>? 😂😂"


thank you for not calling the camera a &quot;shooter&quot;
no explosion jokes!? you guys suck!
Samsung has be alot more innovative than Apple since the Iphone 6.
I love my note 7😍
"I think that it is IP68, not IP67. I should know cause my iPhone 7 Plus is IP67 with 1m of water resistance for 30 min, the Galaxy Note 7 is water resistant up to 1.5m for 30 min. Loved the video though, best tech content around, I anticipate your videos."
"So I got my new note 7, what happens if I dont exchange my old one ?"
he said jjjjjjjjjif. 😒
... did you just say &quot;.jif&quot;
Its JIF not GIF.
axon 7 same specs and cheaper
did he just say jif? WTF
does it go higher then 8 frames per second unlike my note 4?
A larger display does not make any difference to battery life its the pixel count that matters! A larger screen only influences the PPI.
I got this phone a couple of weeks ago. Thank god it didn&#39;t explode on me especially since me and my family were using the VR accessory and the phone was close to my eyes. I liked the phone itself. Very well designed and has a good feel. However I just do not like the Android operating system. The quality of the apps are just so below what I&#39;m used to and the so lag just ruins the experience for me. It&#39;s not too long of a lag but as I used the phone overtime the lag just adds up and makes the phone itself feel cheap and low quality.
how did you use the Note 7 inside the aircraft? I thought it&#39;s illegal to use it during the flight.
This is the best phone!!!
A crappy korean product that explodes when charging and now users that have the  replacement note 7 are complaing that the battery gets very hot and dies quickly. How is this phone better than the iphone 7 again?

"You forgot to mention this so you can make your phone a bit more faster.<br>Tap the build number for 7 times to enable developer options. Once you&#39;ve enabled developer options, develop options will appear in settings just above the About device option. Open developer options scroll down till you see the 3 animation&#39;s and make them from 1x to .05x and it will increase tour speed. Also to root your device and you have the Fap lock on so it wont work so turn it off by doing this: Tap the build number for 7 times to enable developer options. Once you&#39;ve enabled developer options, develop options will appear in settings just above the About device option. Open developer options, the 4th or 5th option should be “OEM Unlock”. Turn on the small icon next to it and that&#39;s all."
Your anti-Apple bias is annoying.  You&#39;re really gonna say this camera is better than the iPhone 7+???  You lose credibility when your bias gets in the way of truth.
not relevant anymore
MKBHD is the GOAT!
"and its ip68, iphone 7 is ip67"
"The camera is good, but not so good on snapchat lool"













Nice T-Shirt ;)
Nicw review
Why does this thumbnail look like I&#39;m looking at the legs &amp; stuff in between?
dude you&#39;re kinda late
When you ware talking about the lag at the lock screen I had that too.  I got the emplacement and turned off lock screen notifications and it seemed to fix it.
review the sony xperia xz
"its a hard g, not pronounced like the peanut butter"
"Hey Mark, can you please giveaway a note 7 to me? I need one note 7 but I am not so much wealthy so I cant afford. Can you help me?"
Those bezels are amazing.
"What is that theme in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m00s"">5:00</a>??"
where can I get that T-shirt?
wish the headphone returned to the top of the phone..I hate it being at the bottom
is it ip-67 or ip-68? i always thought it was ip-68....
"The best battery life phone i have ever used is Xiaomi Redmi note 3, every end of the day i still get &gt;60% battery."
what theme or lockscreen is it at 5.12 ?? if anyone knows plz share it.. thanks in advance :)
the phone does look beautiful. I still have my s5 and it&#39;s just now starting to kinda laggy and annoying to use. Seems every 2 years I&#39;m due for an upgrade because I got this after having 2 years of the s3 and that started doing the same thing. I&#39;m okay with this.
Lol like the flight attendant would let you keep it
"but new batch phones over heat, drain battery quickly and donot charge properly"
Almost got me sammy but ima stay with the iphone 7 plus jet back. I&#39;m going to stay with apple till next years iphone fosho. Cant wait till mophie releases theier new cases
Hey man where did you get that shirt at? it&#39;s dope as fuck
Another great review!
Where is the Camera lens rist band from?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=8m45s"">8:45</a> I like what you did there"
Every dumbass here commenting about the explosions. It won&#39;t happen they fixed it and re released it
explode time
He sad &quot;jif&quot; it&#39;s not fucking &quot;gif&quot; it&#39;s pronounced &quot;jif&quot;
is this the original or the the exchanged? what is the difference?
In landscape  your finger blocks the single tiny speaker huge design flaw.  Also the capacitive buttons are too easy to press with bottom of hand.
iPhone 7 kills it
"&quot;The tip is smaller&quot; @<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m24s"">5:24</a>"

One of your best videos! Keep up the hard work!!
WHEN IS THE NEW STUDIO TOUR COMINGG MARQUES ..I AM FAMISHED
Ha! love the smoke affect!
Thatd be shit if you passed out drunk and someone wanted to get into your phone
That ball with curled up Earpods
Please do the LG V20 review after it released. Thank You
How did you capture the gif on YouTube? I can&#39;t figure it out how to do it.
Question by I&#39;m new to the skin game rather a case  by applying it would it hinder its ability to turn it in for the newest model ie every year or 2?
did he say ip67??? dude 😂😂
Where did you get the shirt? I really like it.
I call bullshit!  Best Camera ?  Not!  IPhone 7 plus dual camera system blows it away.

Is it just me or did the photos he showed look like absolute trash?
You&#39;re holding it wrong so it&#39;s your bad?!?!
Please make a galaxy note 4 2016 review.
Allahu akbar!!<br><br>Like if you get the joke
"Who would want to waste their money on this time bomb? Sure, they got it replaced but the damaged is done, and reputation is ruined."



MKBHD always has the best reviews. Thanks for always doing a great job.
"6p vs note 7 vs Moto z camera review,thnx"
i think he got money from samsung for advertisement
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=8m49s"">8:49</a> MKB confirmed Vaper"
too late review.... i just cant say i liked it....
speakers suck. review that
could u review note 7 against ur favorites 6p
"Anyone noticed the time on the phone @<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m30s"">1:30</a>?"
Wallpaper pls Marques Thaaaanks :D
My favorite feature is the headphone jack!
comments about the note 7 exploding are invalid as Samsung has recalled all of the faulty models and are relaunching the new safe note 7
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m17s"">7:17</a>  The apple earpods ball made my eyes pop out. lol. Insane!"
THOSE EKANS GAINS
IP68!!!
I tried watching in 4k and my router exploded
Still scared
love my note 7 u get use to all these features it&#39;s hard to go back to lesser phones
"But the question is, did the flight attendant actually tell you to power your phone down on that plane?"
"JIF!?!?! Marques, please! Don´t do that again man :D"
ip68*
Does anyone know what type of white studio monitors are in the background? Thanks
That review was da bomb!
"he said Again NEXT for watching in the end at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=10m27s"">10:27</a>"
I was hoping you were going to address the fake Note 7 exploding claims.
<b>*here come the bomb jokes*</b>
The purple wallpaper link please?
I can&#39;t even get the note 7 case it has problems I&#39;ll but an edge instead atleast I do to have worry about it exploding
Where is that shirt from? I need it!
You planning to visit Reston?
my note 7 is amazing
Explosions
I honestly disagreed on the huge hype on Samsung displays and their cameras. Sure they look pretty but they are hugely saturated and inaccurate in terms of colors. <br>That&#39;s why I always liked LGs and Apples camera&#39;s the best
It&#39;s Gif! Not Jif!
&quot;Every once and a while I would try to wake it up and try to start using it and it would just lag a lot for no reason...&quot; That reason he states is the exact reason why I got rid of my s6 and s7 and switched to iPhone because I could not stand the lag anymore - horrible experience. (and before you say I am lying or an iSheep I had a Note 3 with KitKat on it and it was my favorite phone ever.)
Compare note 7 with nexus 6p please
"I have a Sam, I have a Song; Ugh; Samsung"
that t shirt tho 👌👌👌
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23mkbhd"">#mkbhd</a> I&#39;m still waiting for more videos about the new tesla model"

"could you review zenfone 3 deluxe, ultra and normal? :DDD pleeeease?"
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just my note 7 but after getting a replacement battery life seems a bit better than the time bomb I had. still loving this phone.
Dope review as per
Your Shirt!!! BIG LIKE
the only time when apple wins that round
"be care,"
How you can take a photo inside the airplane? Because note 7 is still banned in every airplane
nice t shirt ( joker)
Pls unbox the Nike Apple Watch
Still waiting for the PIXEL phones by Google.
very slow and laggy phone s7 edge is way better. and yeah MKBHD for God&#39;s sake 3 million sets have already been sold its competitor iPhone is out and now your review is up so please i would love to see as the king of tech world but not with these habbits. and i am not being offensive but it always seems that you give some unfair advantage to Google and Samsung<br>and yeah i was i am and i always will remain your big fan

Best Note 7 Review
where can i buy the new samsung galaxy note 7 phone
Ohhhh that theme song 😁😁


hands down the most fair reviews online
Very good review man.  Thanks for pointing out that battery indicator....
Why review a bomb??
Wallpaper?
Great video. Love the shirt. Where did you get it?
just shit buy this shit.
Does note 7 have discrete Aqstic SD dac as htc 10 or not?
iPhone 7 review
Samsung will not replace my note because I bought it from a private party and the private party won&#39;t help me either. does anyone know how I can get it exchanged ..
Apple for people that know absolutely nothing about technology
SAMSUNG NOTE 7 = BOMB
I love note 7!! But im too lazy to carry a fire extinguisher around.....  :(..
Notes should have an excellent battery life. note 7 does not so it sucks!
round 2 ?
how is the new hand warming feature?
"Thanks for making your review, an actual <del>user review</del> not just an overview of the phone. But still, you could have included more. For instance, for each feature you mention, have a point on how that affected (or didn&#39;t) your user experience. For instance, did waterproofing effect your experience?"
"It&#39;s IP68 rated bro, not IP67 lol!"
JIF JIF really? It&#39;s not peanut butter!!!!
lol love how Samsung and their fans love to talk shit about apple. and yet you never hear the same from apple. Samsung is and always be an inferior company to apple. Samsung and Android are the equivalent to a Windows user. Wanting open operating systems that are easily hackable but provide a few cute gimmicks. As well as saving a few dollars here and there. Apple makes the best most reliable tools and have mastered not only function but aesthetic as well.




































"I&#39;m just really not a fan of the edge type screen. The whole &quot;I was holding the phone wrong&quot; seems like it could get annoying, especially since my hands are large. Also, it seems like it has less screen space, even though its the same size as other competitors."
It is pronounced &quot;GIF&quot; guys
Why would you shoot in &quot;a raw mode&quot; if you care how the image looks without any editing. Almost the only reason to shot raw is for editing.
still slower then the iphone 7 deal breaker sadly :( plus the smaller battery :( i really didnt wanna go back to apple :( someone help
Where is the note 6?
Can you review the honor 8 from Huawei?
i thought it was ip68
"there you go, someone who uses the phine said it. I will like you to compare the auto focus on the Note7 to iPhone 7 Dept to feild..."

Marques remember suddenly the note 7 !!!! Tell us how Mach Samsung paid you man
IP68 my friend.<br>The Iphone has IP67
Two questions to Marques.<br>Can You lock the device into 4G(<b>#</b>#4636#<b>#</b>)?<br>New USB... Can You get hdmi signal from the port?
How do you get so many clean shots?
so this phone was relaunched ?
dude ip68 not ip67
Still a damn impressive phone.
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m42s"">5:42</a> did he really just say JIF ??"
make an iphone 7 review
"It&#39;s IP68 not IP67, not that that&#39;s a big deal though"
New csgo bomb
Shoutout to that Pixel launcher!
Does it have UFS?
incoming- &quot; but it explodes&quot;
I just wish that note7 use IOS
"Hi &quot;MKBHD&quot;<br>im watching your review been long time. today I have decided to give you the compliment,<br>&quot;&quot;&quot;You&#39;re the best phone reviewer on youtube&quot;&quot;&quot;"
iphone 6 user here. This video really makes me want to get a note 7.
i have note 4 never upgraded because i like removable batteries.  what should i upgrade to?
IP68... NOT 67
isn&#39;t it IP68 ?
"in the end , Samsung will just abandon the devices without an update . that&#39;s the only problem with Samsung , and that&#39;s why I jump to Xiaomi and Google Nexus 6p"














"Why don&#39;t you guys talk about what is worse than explosive batch of phones, I&#39;m talking about software updates."
"Marcus I do notice better battery with &quot;newer (after recall) model&quot;.  I easily get over 4 hours with always on screen active, standard social media apps (no LED notification), low vibration and sync off. (I sync once a day before i go to bed.)"
Finally
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m32s"">5:32</a> ASMR"
Try to speed the video up to 1.5 ;D
Finally!!!!!
Note 7 vs. Nexus 6p next please!
"I tried a few times to share a GIF I made on Facebook, and it&#39;s just a picture, not an animation."
"Deciding whether to like the video as it&#39;s a great review or dislike it because you said &quot;JIF&quot; not &quot;GIF&quot;... why MKBHD, whyyy? :("
Bring your Tesla out buddy!
&quot;charge it every night&quot;? watch out!!
WALLPAPER :D
&quot;bomb has been planted&quot; :))
What are your thoughts on the Note 7 vs the stock android experience. Waiting to see what Google unveils at the October 4th event with the Pixel/Pixel XL. Coming from a Note 4 here that has substantially slowed down and the battery is shot (even after replacing).
"using a apple product feels like walking through a maze,<br><br>using android products feels like running through an open field of flowers or some shit like that."
The Note 7 has the best display and it has a long battery life.<br>The iPhone 7 Plus has a better camera and its faster.
yay he didn&#39;t die
who the fuck gets a iphone 7.  iphones our so bad.
it&#39;s ip68...
Samsung so lazy they couldn&#39;t upgrade the camera smh
Samsung so lazy they couldn&#39;t upgrade the camera
The only thing that stops me from buying Samsung phones is TouchWiz. I think it&#39;s the worst and ugliest Android skin out there.













After using the s7 edge for 4 months I have concluded that it is the worst phone I have ever used(I had the g3 and g4). It is so frustrating to use. Looks aren&#39;t everything!!!
Please do a Samsung galaxy gear icon x review! thakyou!
IP68 certified! I love your videos! Always thumbs up.
"My Oneplus 3 has crazy battery life, fast charging and doesn&#39;t even get warm."
i put up the wallpaper of the tshirt you are wearing!
JIF
Note 7👑
Anyone knows where can I buy that shirt?
Lets be honest if old ones didnt explode this would have destroyed the iphone.
it laggs when you turn it back on after you&#39;ve shut it down for some reason.😑
"It&#39;s GIF, Marques. Not JIF"
how to price Samsung galaxy note 7
I&#39;m not about to upgrade my Note 4 until they at least make another Note  with an IR blaster and  removable battery. only thing I like about the note 5/7 is the fingerprint scanner because the one on the Note 4 sucks.
When is the phone getting back on the market ?
is it water resistant or water proof?
really nigga really JIG really ?<br>why you are my favourite YouTuber <br>p.s still a follower
"Great video, as always. But it&#39;s an IP68 rating, not IP67 like you mentioned."
hey man i love your videos and all but i wanna say that your frequency of posting stuff is very very low. i mean i get that you focus on quality more than quality but people want to see stuff more often.
Does anyone know what lower third/ line call out pack he uses?
Love the review nice shirt!!!!
useful info for someone who is considering buying it
marques remove the animations so that it will be very speed
isheep gonna hate this vid
"Man, how do you make a mistake like this. It&#39;s IP 68 not IP 67 , there is a difference..."






















Please please please do an LG V20 video!!!!
Please please please do an LG V20 video!!!!
it&#39;s Awsm
"watching a review of a phone I&#39;m too broke to get. Niether will anyone buy it for me lol <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sadlyf"">#sadlyf</a>"
Old intro Song.... I&#39;m so glad to hear it again😍😍
Great breakdown as always!
damn i want that tee.
"tell me something between the Note 7 and the Pixel XL that Google is planning to reveal on October 4th , which one you think is going to be a better choice and which one are you getting as your daily driver?"
"whoah. i thought you were going to save the best for last, but you didn&#39;t even take the pen out of the phone? do i have to join youtube red to see that part?"
"Great review, but I think I&#39;m going to stick with the iPhone 7+, the speakers are amazing on the 7+, my iPhone 6 is louder than the note 7 speakers."









"Hey everyone, I&#39;m a longtime iphone user and am heavily considering making the switch from my iphone 6s to the Note 7, but I too have heard not so great things about touchwiz. If you switch launchers to lets say, the Nova launcher, do you lose all abilities and features of the S pen and edge? <br><br>Also, would you guys still recommend the Note 7 or wait till the S8? <br><br>Thanks!"
DID YOU JUST SAY JIF? THIS IS MADNESS!
"You might wanna think about replacing it again ^^ <a href=""http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2016/09/23/galaxy-note-7-owners-issues-non-exploding-replacement-device/"">http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2016/09/23/galaxy-note-7-owners-issues-non-exploding-replacement-device/</a>"
He would&#39;ve raped Apple if their battery exploded. I think he&#39;s a bit too biased towards Samsung/ Android.
The Galaxy note 7the best phone ever love this phone thanks to Samsung.

&quot;JIF&quot;
I want that t-shirt!! link please
The Note 7 has an IP68 rating and not IP67.
Note 7 is still the champ!!!!! yiha!!!
Love reading the comment section when a new phone comes out people are so  passionate
it has cgg5 u forgot to mention!
note 7 is better than iPhone 7plus in display battery camera and looks
The first thing my family asked me when I brought this phone home is DOESN&#39;T THAG EXPLODE?!?!
At the end of video RIP Marques Brownlee lmao
in the end!
Lol how are u alive
I like that you have to mention that phones have a headphone jack now.
"i think it&#39;s IP68 certified, not IP67."
Will you do a review about the asus zenfone 3 series?
lmao the random decor! the ball of earphones omg 😂
sorry but the best camera for steals and selfi is on the 6P. you can check it out.
"wow,  I guess I gotta get one"
Been waiting for you to review this phone
Been waiting for you to review this phone
jif or gif?



That joker shirt is cool where did you get it?
Those leading lines in that thumbnail 😍
Wish they could go to the Exynos chips
getting mine soon! damn i wish i didnt bought the note 5.
GIF WITH A HARD G GODDAMIT!!!
this review is way too late...sorry.
"the note 7 still has a problem the phone turns black when u charge it ,read this in the nespaper"
Apple fantards still saying &quot;at least my phone doesn&#39;t explode...(crying on the inside)&quot;
"boom, boom, boom. Note7 is coming."
"For some reason I trust the word this guy says, others they feel like they are being paid by the company to review the product. For instance on another channel this guy was talking about how good vpn are and why you should you use them and guess what the video was sponsored by opera vpn? 😂"
7 mil conto....
the phone still has a problem the phone becomes black when u charge it read this on my newspaper SO SAD
Its called GIF not JIF
"i can&#39;t decide, note 7 or iphone 7 or the upcoming pixel...<br><br>my biggest issue with the note 7 could be now that they fixed the explosions alot of people reporting the phone is heating and over draining the battery, plus the lagging it does with every samsung phone which i really hate<br><br>iphone 7 is great and all but man 1080p sure i won&#39;t notice it that much i still need the fast charging<br><br>pixel... i dont know yet waiting<br><br>any suggestions? please be reasonable guys :D"


Can you post a link to that wallpaper you&#39;re rocking on your mac?
Please........ Make A RiVew O f GoPro KarMa.
Phones really need to focus on designing software that doesn&#39;t place a bunch of controls on the top of the screen....
I thought every minute in that video it would explode in your face
"5-inch size phone with that design, I will definitely sell my kidney to buy it."
love the video. But I gotta say more tesla stuff
The new blue color is sexy
I  bet someone threw his Note 7 outta his window bcs he was afraid of explosion and this guy stole it ahaha
"totally agree on accidentaly touching the display, but when i got a case it fixed that problem. so wasnt a big deal"
I believe the Note 7 is IP68 certified. You say IP67 when mentioning it. Great review!
"Check out the Jerryrigeverything scratch test video, the screen is super easy to scratch. I think a level 3 on the hardness scale permanently scratched the screen. I returned my note 7 a week or two after the recall. They did a really bad job with that recall. No body knew wtf was going on with it."
When will you be posting a review of the LG V20??
"That waffle house shout <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m22s"">3:22</a>"
"Ireally didn&#39;t like the Gorilla Glass 5, it scratched way too easily compared to the s7 edge.  Not needing a screen protector is a feature, needing one is a failure."
MKBHD likes black phones because he was black
"Three Biggest Reasons NOT to buy Note 7: <br>- Larger screen and smaller    battery 3500 mAh; not for power users<br>- Really bad sounding speakers, Samsung could put better speakers like Apple did with iPhone 7, keeping the phone water-resistant <br>- Laggy software which is the main consideration in a $850 phone.."




i will purchase it :D
please do more videos on your car
stay safe mkbhd
They could&#39;ve done a better job on the Iris scanner (like on the lumia 950)
Man this guys intro sounds so good <br><br><br><br>I always turn my volume up lol
Yo I like his shirt WERE did he get it from
jif? jif?! unsubscribed.
This phone really blew up the smartphone game huh?<br><br>i want to die
when Samsung makes better bombs then isis 😂
Strange question but where did you get that super cool shirt?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=8m10s"">8:10</a> That small white lint/fluff on your eyelash (left eye from viewer&#39;s prospective, right-eye from your prospective) is rather distracting!"
"good phone, sucks about the explosive problem"





The best phone money can buy.
Ip68 u mean
I see Marques I hit like.<br>nice review :)
"At this point, it&#39;s either the Note 7 or the Pixel XL."
Best phone on the market right now by far. iPhone isn&#39;t really all that simple it&#39;s just dumbed down and as a result it is lacking in technology.
did I hear IP67? I thought it&#39;s IP68 that&#39;s what it says on my Note 7 box












If you still have that mac why don&#39;t you get a new one and dual boot it ?
IP68*
*IP 68
"oh you say JIF?<br>sure I&#39;ll just go home, play with my jolden retriever and have a look at my jarage"
"I thought it was Ip68 certified, iPhone 7 is Ip67 certified..."
isn&#39;t it ip68
When the only good thing about your phone is that it doesn&#39;t explode....you have an iProblem.
It&#39;s much less responsive than the 6P. Screen and pen are the only things that are better.
you always keep things real. kudos!!!
it&#39;s IP68 though  :) iPhone 7 is IP67...
dat wallpaper?
make the videos in 60 fps!
Every person who settled for an iPhone 7: &quot;uh Well at least my phone won&#39;t explode...hehe.&quot;
shooting this in Jon&#39;s studio :D
"Link to wallpaper, please?"
The note 7 features the same explosive design as its brothers.<br>But in a slightly more literal way.
"Man, you produce the best reviews in terms of production quality. Your videos look so crisp and high-end, and not one second of the clip looks out of place or unnecessary. <br><br>Cheers from India."
"You are an absolute Pro. Great job, as usual. Great phone too. I love mine."
WHY SOO LATE!!!
That was an explosive review
Ow this video from drag times! Awesome! P100d killing it.
marquecho brownleecho
jif
Marques....I think the phone is IP68 certified. At 7.33 you mention it is IP 67.
I live in Brazil and didn&#39;t understand when u say how the carriers works in the USA? can someone explain? why isnt easy to do the recall?
MKBHD is a boss.
ive done a really nice video with the Note 7&#39;s camera.
that was an explosive review
You got any ear pods I can borrow mate?
boommm
I think this is a sponsored video from samsung to regain its reputation.
"ppl please just stop buying iPhone, this note 7 is a better phone."
"This may be the only time I haven&#39;t clicked thumbs up or down on your video. We are best friends, but you don&#39;t know that, lol (because I have heard you talk more than any other friend, hahaha.) I still have Note 4 and have been waiting for the upgrade. I skipped Note 5, because they disappointed me (not because it wasn&#39;t a major upgrade from mine, but because they left so much opportunity out they could have done.) So the S7 came out and got me excited the Note 7 was going to be brilliant. Remember how Notes piloted all the best of the best and it wasn&#39;t the S Series? Well, not the case any more!<br><br>Okay, so why didn&#39;t I give it a thumbs up? You waited forever. I&#39;m sure u needed to see what was going to happen about the explosions. And I defended Samsung until my brain hurts. They have so much to do to change their reputation from this, it hurt them so bad. But I couldn&#39;t get one when I was defending them, Oct. 4th and Google has me waiting, and now hearing about the S8..........makes me not want this phone again. Knowing they have to do alot to redeem themselves, I thought there would be some great bargains (throw in that charging case for your lame battery or give me 6 Gigs to say &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;) Alas, no. I&#39;m so frustarted, typing anything further sounds like whining. 1.) Please don&#39;t wait this long again for EVERYONE&#39;S daily driver. 2.) Another elephant not addressed is should I buy the plus sized 67 over this, since it is everything and a better battery and cheaper or are the perks really worth it? 3.) Don&#39;t tell us what we already know for 85-90% of the video. Those who watch your videos aren&#39;t really new to these phones. We need your insight from owning it and using it like a boss. More details of your use. I know u did, but more please.<br><br>Much respect!"
Hey guys I&#39;ll be giving away an iPhone 7 32GB in the next 2 weeks as my 150 subscriber giveaway. To stand a chance on winning all you have to do is sub to my page. Pretty easy right? Good luck!
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m16s"">7:16</a> did i just saw a ball of handfrees?"
still better than the iphone
so now they have our finger prints and iris scans
"you are holding wrong? really? <br><br>any phone with this kind of &quot;bezeless&quot; screen should have palm rejection on the corners, this is a design fault you are not holding it wrong."
"Best phone out there , still not buying it cuz Pixel and LG"
Iphone 8 has no charging port so if your phone dies you need to buy a new phone
exynos is better version than 820
IP68*. gr8 video anyway :D
Can&#39;t decide between black or silver.. after a few drops the scratches will show more on the black metal frame I think.. I also think it will show fingerprints more.. but compared to the silver it&#39;s so sleek.. Which one then???
"Had the Note 3,4,5 and the software sucks, just lags and freeze"






Take care mark. It might blow up
JIF??? DID YOU SAY JIF INSTEAD OF GIF???? <b>triggered</b>
Samsung boys about to be like... &quot;6GB RAM MARQUES&quot;
Great video quality as always. 👍
Great work!
Death note 7
Finally the much awaited review!!! What took you so long!
Great review as always Marques (Crispy AF). I currently own a Iphone 6s Plus 64gb and I am seriously thinking of going back to Android because of the Note 7. Beautiful hardware and capable hardware in a slightly smaller (but consequent)  form than the Iphone 6s plus or 7 plus. The only thing that I would want from the Iphone 7 plus would be the stereo speakers.
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> IP68 water resistance not IP67"
I&#39;m a fan of Galaxy Note but I still get scared from hearing the news about how it explode. Hope the new one didn&#39;t explode.
you know Apple Users are retards when they are still joking about the explosive Note 7...














Did he just say jif?! 😒😂
"+marques Another great vid! Always dropping quality material. Question though, is the Note 7 IP67 or IP68?"
IP68* Certified MKB
"Roses are red,<br>peeps got the note 7,<br>That&#39;s cool and all,<br>but 0.1% users went straight to heaven."
Ip68 certified not 67
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m23s"">7:23</a> &quot;and a headphone jack of course&quot; whoops lol"
I want this shirt! Where can I get it?
Oh noo MKBHE cmon he said &quot;Jif&quot; its notlike you say photojraphy instead of photography
Rather have this in my pocket and explode me like ISIS than using a fuckass iPhone smfh
Did he just say Jif? It is GIF
Everyone read the video synopsis and tell me it&#39;s not hilarious!!!
"Okay seriously Samsung has to step it up. The difference between this and the S7 edge is literally the S pen, the iris scanner, and 0.2 more inches of screen, for 80 or so more bucks? What&#39;s the point of it having all the features in the world if it can&#39;t even last a full day?? Samsung is trying to play apples game and they don&#39;t have the software to do it."
wow i thought the iphone 7 cam would be better?
Where does he get those wonderful shirts?
Isn&#39;t it IP68? @marquesbrownlee
"I received my new note 7, Stunning devise!  Runs circles AROUND the &quot;BORING IPHONE&quot;"
is your intro is copyrighted.<br>why you use it?
i put a ruler under my pillow to mesure how long i slept
luckily it didn&#39;t blow up during the review
Dude never mind the phone who is your internet provider.
"Any comments on HTC Desire 10 Pro, would you be reviewing it?"
anyone else having lag with keyboard. or not even recognising key stroaks
Why do you have to review this shit
"iPhone 7 Plus is the better phone in every aspect, only the screen looks better despite the iPhone&#39;s screen being the most color accurate screen in a consumer device ever."









is it better than the iphone 7 plus? camera n performance
Samsung should really change touchwiz... :/
"Water proof? But no warranty if the phone stops working because of water ingress. Instead of using rubber seals to water proof, why don&#39;t manufacturers spray components with nanotechnology coating. This would be the future for all phones."
I might get the note 7 this year just because it has an aux port
IP67? or IP68?



Anyone knows what is this wrist band marques uses?
Anyone knows what is this wrist band marques uses?

honor 8 rewiew
He says jif...

is the note 7 camera better than the lg v20?
"Im getting frustrated waiting for this to return to the market. Disappointing start for Samsung. Oh well, October 21st it is then. 😯"
I had a note 7 but got an iPhone 7. iOS is faster... I miss the QHD display 😢😰. This 720 display sucks.
#NAME?
The smoke man. I bet your Note 7 felt like it was in a Horror movie
What is a JIF? Only know GIF...
"At least the iPhone 7 Plus doesn&#39;t explode<br>Sub = 20 chances to win an iPhone 7 Plus<br>Like = 5 chances to win an iPhone 7 Plus<br>Ignore = you just missed out on 25 chances to win an iPhone 7 Plus, but have a great day :)"












I wish that i have enough money to buy an S7 Edge 😊😘😁
he said it was IP67 water proof and it&#39;s IP68
Best Phone 2016!

vape life 😎😎😎
Good lord this comment section is a cesspool.

Note 7 sucks. Xiaiomi FTW
You got a few Software Updates wow how did you get those ?

Can you review samsung galaxy tab pro s mate thanks
im talking about indigo airlines
where u get that joker shirt?
it&#39;s gif not jif
Please review HTC One X9
it&#39;s ip68
s6 ou nexus 6p ??
"Slow and Laggy, big time!  Look at a few videos that show the 6S lapping the Note 7 more than twice as fast. Fingerprint ready is pretty bad, better than the S6 and Note 5 but too slow and most of the times doesn&#39;t work well.   I agree that the camera and build are top notch, but again Samsung lag is still present like always!"
By the way it&#39;s rated IP68 for dust and water resistance!
Great review MKBHD!
More APOLLO videos...... Plz
bro thank you <br>it took a lot a guts to come out like that .....its the way you framed it ...Amazing
Booom!
Where&#39;d you get that shirt?
I would get this phone if i didnt already buy my S7 edge a few months back. BEST phone EVER and thats coming from somebody who swore not to get another galaxy after getting the S4.

Selling my iphone 6s after this review for the 7.. Note 7
I can&#39;t speak for iPhone as have never had one. I had the note 7 before the recall. I personal think this phone is amazing. Personally this fan boy android vs apple is kinda sad. Use what works for you and what you like.

That Joker shirt though
This Phone has NOPE written all over it
"At the end of the day it comes down to the OS for me. I wanted to switch from iOS just to try something different, but every time my mom comes asking me how do I do this on her Android phone. It just reminds me as to why I never switched. Plus Apple has a nice eco system &amp; I like that so I&#39;m good. <br>This is my opinion I don&#39;t need you to tell me how much Apple suck. You like what you like I like what I like oaky."
MKBHD somehow always leans towards Samsung phones.. I wonder why the Droid Z&#39;s are not much appreciated as they should be.
Stopped at JIF... Graphics Interchange Format... No J here.



A video packed with promoting the new Samsung Note 7 and all the android users can&#39;t help but comment on how awful the iPhone is lol where I come from we call that jealousy

how long does your note 7 battery lasts? how long is your screen on time?
&quot;Bit of a reputation&quot; lol
MKBHD reviews never disappoint 👌
The slowness when waking the device up is because of DOZE!!!!!

Compare it with iPhone7
"So... You have about 50 apps open at the same time and you mention 1-2 secs lagging when waking the phone up? Wow! :)  And funny to see how all of your photos are 4:3s, they look like they were taken with an iPhone :) Great review,  thanks so much!"

is the display technology on the Note 7 the same as the Note 4&#39;s? They both have Qhd displays and Super Amoled. So what would make him so convinced that the Note 7 has the best display in the market?

I personally think that the iPhone 7+ has a better cameras

scare to get it might set my house on fired
For all the insane specs that the Note 7 has it&#39;s still miles behind any iPhone in terms of performance! Like to the point where it&#39;s actually embarrassing smh and I have a note 7 but this shit is beyond Laggy and I&#39;ve tried everything so I need that iPhone 8 to drop next year lol
There are some report out that are saying that the new battery is overheating. Is it not overheating??

"I would say maybe it is the best camera, but definitely not the most innovative. LG V20 is a 100 times better this case with full manual control and wide angle lens."
Android is better than iPhone but Samsung is the Apple of Android.
Great job my bro :)
Returned mine. Was going to get it replace but it&#39;s to slow for me. Maybe next year Samsung
Omg you said &quot;GIF&quot; correctly! So many people on the internet tend to pronounce it the new way. Great video.
rumor is the newer batch is lagging as well. can anyone confirm?
How is this phone so sleek?! That camera hump and screen are flawless.
This review is legit and colorful.. Keep it up Marques. Decent.. Decent.. Decency made perfect. Kudos bro!

"Start-up lag: its because the OS is probably clearing your RAM and cache assuming u will use something new when u start it up again. Sadly what that means is that you have a paging lag as the pages are pulled into memory.

dope. as always
Best display but certainly not the best camera.











I have an original note 7...not turning mines in. Had no issues whatsoever. 100 bad phones out of 3 million had an issue world wide. You can do the math on that in terms of the chances of something happening.
who will be bored of Android.
"damn nigga, finally"
Yay always excited to see another video from you!
&quot;I was blown away by this phone&quot;
it&#39;s ip68!!!!
It&#39;s IP68 actually Marques!
I still didn&#39;t replace mine for the new one bc they didn&#39;t bring replacement yet to my country. however even with the battery charging to max of 60% it&#39;s still way better battery than the iPhone 😂
"I literally ROFL&#39;d at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m16s"">7:16</a> @MarquesBrownlee :P"

Just wanted to ask that is anyone in your family from india 🇮🇳??? :)
pricey but least if you wait til Christmas you know at least it gets discounted unlike apple phones and it&#39;s not excluded in catalogue twenty percent off codes which happen about twice a year (UK)  which apple products get excluded on. 👍

I still don&#39;t understand why Marques is always saying that the anodized aluminum is grippy and the glass is slippery
To be honest I&#39;m really disappointed in this review. You can&#39;t include so many functions of note 7 in a 10-minute review. It has edge display and I didn&#39;t see any of  it&#39;s functions. This phone is unique because of the s pen and there was a little mention about the pen in the video. Thumbs way down. Sorry
"As screens now are flowing over the edges, shouldn&#39;t  there be a way for developers to deactivate part  the digitizer on the sides? As you say your self, It&#39;s hard to grab the phone without making an input. Please tell Google and Samsung 😊"
l like his shirt.
make comparison of.. 1st. IPhone 7 plus vs Note 7<br>2nd. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge vs Note 7.
This phone is fire.....literally...
I love hearing people talk about the Note 7 exploding when they have no clue about it. I pull out my replacement phone (with the awful green battery icon) and show them everything it can do. They are simply amazed that any phone has that much capability.

"try 4x4 or 4x5 icon arrangement, you will find there is no lag anymore."
I ended up returning mine prior to the battery scandal because it had horrible performance issues. I wasn&#39;t running anything out of the norm but that thing would lag throughout simple tasks. I was ready to exchange it for a new one but at that time they were out of stock and then... the whole battery recall. I&#39;m willing to give it another chance.
Does the battery percentage leak on your device?
Note7 is THE BOSS
He said jif! WITH A J! YAY

First time in history tech channel to review a bomb 😂😂
Nice job on the review.
This (with new battery) or LG V20..  My issue with the V20 is that I was hoping my next phone was waterproof.. Not to say that&#39;s been an issue the last 9 years


"i wish they made those rubber wristbands a little smaller for guys like us with small wrist, because it ends up half way down our forearm when moving about"

Great review!!! Many thanks!!!
"You see Marques... I have an HTC One M7, and comparing its display against my friend&#39;s Galaxy S6, it shows the better sharpness on the HTC, despite the Samsung having the higher resolution and PPI. So I was wondering if that&#39;s because of the Pentile matrix on the S6. I mean, it&#39;s quite evident the HTC having the sharper display when comparing with my own eyes, and since the S6 has almost the same display as the Note 7... what do you think about this?"




you forgot the exploding feature
"Galaxy note 7 could explode on you, LG G4 has a problem where it dies because of some loose contacts, and this are from &quot;BEST&quot; leading companies that sell phones, it costs you anywhere form 600$ to 900$ and it can just die over time, or even worse EXPLODE on you, and this companies are just chill about it, they won&#39;t even replace non-carrier models, I am getting myself Nokia 3310 :D"


"Oh boohoo, comments please shh"
I watch these videos not because of the tech but to see badass RED WEAPON quality footage.
at least it have a headphone jack
I&#39;m pretty sure something&#39;s wrong with the audio here
MKBHD said &quot;IP67&quot;.<br>It&#39;s actually IP68 water resistant.  Resistant to 5 feet rather than 3. IPhone 7 is IP67.
this phone will scream allahu akbar in my hand?
who makes decisions like putting a smaller battery in a bigger phone with more features
Any dl links for the wallpaper? : D
So does it explode ?! :)

The best camera is the iPhone 7 plus camera






its just cant overcome with d ram management..v20 is much bttr
bout time
is the new battery better or worse with battery life?
well looks like im getting it.  i was upset bout the battery blowing up but now im ready to spend this money
Marques can you make an review about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy s8? what do you think it&#39;ll come out?
any over heating issues with the post recall version?
best device out there hands down
I feel like this is samsung&#39;s time to shine. This phone is really going to blow up!
nice
"as soon as the &quot;new&quot; Note 7ss are available, I&#39;ll buy them."

Explosive review.
The iPhone is better Samsung  is a death trap

s7 edge still much better in some ways especially the battery

The earpods lol
what&#39;s your favorite phone so far in 2016?
Are they going to release a new note 7 or are they going to just fix those recalled products?
It didn&#39;t come out two weeks ago it came in august!!
I prefer iPhone

"Galaxy note 7 wins with the features, its screen is just bright and beautiful that balanced the colours in excellent way, Android freedom, amazing camera, and good battery life. IPhone 7 as all iPhones win by the stability of the iOS only, I can&#39;t really think of a feature that really beats the note7, maybe the quality of the Snapchat videos? Well that&#39;s maybe."
Allahu Akbar 🔥
Don&#39;t play with an atomic bomb.
nice review
"I think u r little worried while holding that phone ,"
BOOM!
"The mention that the phone lags when you wake it up happens on my S7 Edge too. I dont know why, but it makes me terrified of restarts because the 1st hour or two after boot, my phone performs like shit. I asked about that problem months ago in xda and no one knew shit about it. Nice to know i wasnt the only 7 user thats been having to bare with that complaint"
I got my replacement yesterday best phone ever so many features make your head spin
my s7 edge camera lens is foggy from water...<br>so much for water proof<br>also it was only in the water for 2 mins
"Man, the production value of your vids never ceases to amaze me. So many little things that might go unnoticed but make such a big difference. That smoke effect when talking about the exploding batteries was great. Keep up the awesome work!"
Hm
I heard someone say that after the battery have been change the performance have been downgrade is it true or just a myths
is that the black matte or black leather dbrand skin?
I&#39;m an Apple fanboy but am coming into the video with a open mind.
100 of them?  Not sure that is accurate
Is it just me or does anyone else say &quot;peace&quot; with Marques when he ends his videos?
"Still waiting for my Note 7 after ordering it a month ago, in the middle of all these explosions."
I wanted this but..I rather not have explosions. So I went with the LG G5!

"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m17s"">7:17</a> probably earpods from iPhones. May be he got so pissed off about it bundled them up put it on display lol"
Samsung Lag. Even MKBHD mentioned it. Daily use can be irritating especially when you wake your device up and the phone is stalling and jumpy trying to catch up with user input... and also when your notification shade gets choppy. The Note 7 is a great device however but Samsung has not married the optimizations properly with Snapdragon processors and it&#39;s pain to see other companies like HTC and LG along with Google Nexus devices run smoother and snappier than Samsung&#39;s offerings especially for the price Samsung wants you to pay. I will be waiting for the S8. I returned my Note 7 for a refund a month back. I&#39;m hoping Exynos makes it to the S8 in the US Version.
Do a giveaway!
"woah, so suprised to see note 7 being the same size with iphone, this changes everything..... before I never really thought about getting the bigger phones for obvious reason: size. Now I know what im getting for my next upgrade"





Honor 8 ad before Note 7 review. priceless :&#39;D
"In Norway, this will ship with the Exynos processor. Does anyone know if there will be any noticable difference in loading speeds etc.? I have it pre-ordered (was supposed to come out on the 9th of September here.. but then it yeah.. exploded.. so October it is!)."


hey dude did the box came with the black mark showing it&#39;s safe?

am I the only one who feels like iOS is impossible complicated to use?

It is still not there in india
i used apple until the 6. after that i switched to note7. seriously the best decision i ever made.
"No its not your bad, its Samsung design flaw."
MARQUES! Please tell me how you did the callout text effect
"decent review, but I&#39;m left feeling a tad disappointed.  one the things you said in the video, that it was your bad when your hand touched the screen and made the phone unresponsive.   As a user... how is it your fault that a phone has that as a defect?  I mean shouldn&#39;t a HAND HELD  device be natural in the hand? NOT have to learn how to hold it so that we don&#39;t activate the gimmicky wrap around screen?"
Is it IP67 or IP68? The number change matters .......... A LOT!


"To be fair, iPhone 7 also lags."
IP68

Don&#39;t know why but you are out of the game man!!! Maybe your reviews are late.
You can legally buy bombs now?
I lasted 24 hours with this phone because of the lag situation. I ran back to my 6P because my Note 7 would lag so much and the battery drain was unreal.
But touchwiz?
So as per you the premium shit from Samsung still lags when starting!!! And how much did they pay you to tell that still you&#39;re happy with it? I got the replacement and sold it immediately.
"ooohhh so you wear contacts. all this time I thought you went straight up <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thuglife"">#thuglife</a> and just tried to live life without glasses"
Samsung is in need of this review.
<b>Screen unresponsive while holding</b><br>&quot;I&#39;m holding it wrong my bad!&quot; <br><br><br><br><br>ok.



























i want a note 7 for traveling but they banned at at our airport.
Jif? Really?

This is not what i want Marques........ i want tesla videos!
I must say video production quality is going higher and higher
@mlbhd <br><br><b>*</b> Grabs and watches the fire extinguisher:<br>:<br>This phone wont explode!!! <br><br>Watches fire extinguisher AGAIN!!!<br><br>Lmao
"Another great video, love the black Note 7, waiting for mine in the UK."
Fire extinguisher at the ready
Fast charge explosion is a pretty hot feature.
Ip68
"What&#39;s that wallpaper in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m57s"">1:57</a> ? anyways awesome vid"
"3 and a half SOT is shit , any company can put a 4k or 2k screen on their phone and say it&#39;s the best but if it kills the battery really quick it&#39;s pointless..."
I bet you actually stole all the phones you review
Where&#39;d you get that shirt? I wanna purchase one.

Better late than never ehh
MKBHD..Please review the LG V20...have been waiting for that review for like forever now..
Amazing phone
"Marques, is that a custom always on display app or the stock one included with the galaxy range? I ask because the always on display on my s7 edge doesn&#39;t show app notifications"
sick shirt... i want it
I heard this phone was the bomb.
nice
You might as well review a grenade lol
Whats always off putting with Samsung based Android is the sheer amount of bloat in their OS. Would put XtreStoLite on it if I could but that probably voids the warranty.
Thank god it  has not exploded yet!
jif vs gif.... lol
"is there a slight (barely audible) echo on this video, Marques ?"
nice shirt!
Marques where do you get your t shirts from
RIP MARQUES.
office tour at some point? is it all set up?
The echo on the video still exists - I know you&#39;re working on it but thought I&#39;d mention FYI
what im wondering is WHERE DID YOU GET THAT SHIRT?
Samsung or Iphone. Which one do you use?
watching this on my safe note 7 but what u should of said at the end was get the exynos one ie faster and better battery 😉
"Really crispy video, cant wait to see what 8K looks like"
"Sony phones, like the one I&#39;m using to watch this video, have been water proof from the start and always had great stereo sound, front facing speakers. So, no, being water proof doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t invest in sound. Samsung just doesn&#39;t care (same as Apple) on good speakers."

what the hell did he call himself?
Samsung has been on fire lately...
Can you review the new Xperia XZ?
I haven&#39;t read all the comments but isn&#39;t it ip68 certified?
Are you ever going to review the LG V20 or G5?
The best tech reviewer on YouTube? I think so!
that review was the bomb !
meanwhile using my note 2 :&#39;)
"Why don&#39;t you review Sony&#39;s phones, XZ trumps this in every way. I kinda believe that if XZ had a problem with display &quot;the way you hold it&quot; would be a big minus. There are other brands except Moto, iFruit, Scamsung... OP3 and XZ are best phones of the year, XZ quality wise, OP3 bang for buck wise."
lagging lol. yep that&#39;s high end. nothing changes.
So he blocked the Exit door with a screen cutting his way out in case of possible detonation. Fire hazard.
omg this phone is so hot. hehe
Apple made the iPhone 7 water proof and added a speaker 🤔













to me....
this phone is pure fire. hehe
its mind blowing. hehe
giv way that....
mAh of battery?
mAh of battery?
nice video..
nic video
Too much lag and latency.
Guys let&#39;s all stop roasting this phone it has been flamed enough
@marques_brownlee best reviewer
u are the best bro....................
"It is not worth the price. Full stop. It is bias to suggest it is IMO. By release time in Nov (UK) at £850 it will have a year old chipset that has been superseded. All it has over the S7 Edge is the S-pen and if that is not your thing then the gimmicks like the iris scanner are not enough for the £400 extra it costs over the S7Edge. Bearing in mind the battery life is much better on the s7 Edge and it is a better performing phone with few issues this is a very one sided review. No mention of the sub par performance on anything intensive, terrible RAM management, disappointing battery life (many reviews struggle to get 3-4 hours), scratchy GG5, only 4gb RAM, no options for 128 or 256 GB storage, USB-C data rates seemingly not up to standard, etc. You can still support Samsung but a balanced review is always better, and this was not IMO."

"IP68, The IPhone 7 has IP67 water resistance"
boom
Finally
Daylyt keeps it a Quillion
"it wont explode, right?"
pls google pixel be a good phone and cheap
I kinda like ur shirt. Where did u buy it?
"That earpods ball. Yeah, we saw it. :)"
this phone is pure perfection 🖤
i always wait till he says &quot;peace&quot; in the end.
can you make a iphone 7 vs galaxy s7<br>and iphone 7 plus vs galaxy note 7 camera
samsung note ....great phone
This review is crispy and explosive
"When are you gonna change your name to MKB4K?  Time for an upgrade, dude."
&quot;you&#39;re holding it wrong&quot;
"Minuses that turned me away from note 7<br><br>- not high end specs like they used to( I&#39;m pretty sure they could&#39;ve put stereo speakers, 4000 mAh battery, 6 GB RAM 32 bit DAC<br>-lags <br>-explodes <br>-bump in price for no reason"
Why is this video about a Samsung phone getting so many people about the iPhone?<br><br>It&#39;s a different phone wtf.
You&#39;re playing a dangerous game using that time bomb
That earpod ball was cool!
i want a great smartphone if i want a great camera i buy a dslr cheaper than this.
selling note evans ?
This video is THA BOMB!
second recall upcoming :D
hey MKBHD when we will be able to see the full studio tour?<br>lots of things are changed in the background
I prefer galaxies
@MKBHD should i upgrade from my nexus 6P(to the note 7)? i&#39;m not that satisfied with my nexus..
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m16s"">7:16</a> Whata hell? hahaha lol!! where or how did you get so many iphone headphones?"









IP68!
someone didn&#39;t turn their note 7 lmao
2016 and Samsung still lags....thats just ridiculous.
how come mkbhd took note 7 onto a flight????<br>note 7 = on flight =mind and flight blown = two birds one stone!!!!
beast phone best camera display battery
"I had this phone since release and was very disappointed with day to day performance (laggy interface), mediocre battery life, slow slow thumbprint reader, and how the s pen would get stuck in the sleeve after getting wet.  The photos were amazing.  The screen is amazing.  But the little things that affected everyday use piled up and I&#39;m going back to iOS."
"Way too late dude,"
First reply is gau


"LOL,it&#39;s not your bad that you are touching the display <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m30s"">1:30</a> There should have been a flat version of this phone...."
it&#39;s &quot;gay-if&quot;
yo mkbhd the Galaxy note 7 is IP68 not IP67 waterproof like u said in the video
This video was a blast!
where is iphone 7 review??<br>I am really interested to see it
I wish he&#39;d go back to the old intros. The vocals in this one are nasty
I think its IP68
Do you think I should wait for Pixel or just buy One Plus 3? I am with Nexus from last 3 years. And the rumor is Pixel will start at $649.
"mine had a defective battery, so I just bought a nexus. the note 7 was the best phone ever except for that price thou"
+MarquesBrownlee Isn&#39;t Note 7 ip68 certified?
"96 thousand views in 3 hours. <br>MKBHD, how do you do this?!"
I&#39;m poor enough can&#39;t afford one but I gotta make a joke about it &quot;get it to end up urlife house or car &quot;
It hurts when I&#39;m watching this on my Note 3. 💔
you know why it lagged??? Because it&#39;s deciding if it&#39;s gonna go kill it self by making the battery go boom or if it&#39;s just like nah next time i will😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
where did you get that tshirt im loving it
Would buy if I had the money. Instead going with an OnePlus Three :)

































and explosions😂😂
There&#39;s something not right about that thumbnail.
Great review. This phone is the bomb.😨
give the link of wallpaper please 😄
do they not explode anymore?
samsung should try Matte Black too.. would add to the charm xD
I think note 7 have Snapdragon 821...u said 820?
"I am an IPhone user , but i am proud of Samsung"
My phone kept dropping to my face... Guess my phone doesn&#39;t want me to cheat with the Note 7😂
I lost a friend
"Wow, My Galaxy Alpha a few years ago had my battery pregnant... Samsung still has these issues!?"
t-shirt 🙌
Samsung&#39;s on fire
"only have a 6s because I wanted to try out iOS, so many small things that Apple could easily add to make it better but nah. i want a note 7"
I like that shirt!
What is that ball of ear buds???
It&#39;s IP68 not 67 :)
this phone is straigt fire
"Must be the new studios space, but your audio is has echo. :("
Brace yourselves for &quot;It Exploded&quot; comments
I can take better photos on my OnePlus 2
JIF
has anyone else noticed they skipped the note 6
jif
iPhone 7 has better specs and better raw performance in all the benchmarks. Samsung has a hot mess of a brick.

























What is the Launcher used ? <br>Thanks in advance.
"man you killed the poor <a href=""http://speedtest.net"">speedtest.net</a>"
The Note 7 is IP68. The iPhone 7 is IP67
Again a great one man.
"Thanks Marques, always enjoy your reviews. This is my next phone."
is these same phone that airport authority not allowing to carry in flight
y u so good???!!!
"The Best video for any Gadget review that can be <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Awesome"">#Awesome</a> 😉"
you&#39;re soooooo late for this review
Samsung galaxy note 7 is 100 time&#39;s better than iphone 7 just change it
"Hey Marques, it&#39;s IP68. :)"
You Where Contacts ?
it&#39;s GIF not JIF
So about that shirt where did you get it please link
i like u man
Hey @MKBHDis the Galaxy note 7 IP67 or IP68??
I LOVE the Joker T-shirt
"Looks like you got the new AT&amp;T Note 7. I have gone to multiple AT&amp;T stores and called their main line,  but they DO NOT have the replacement phones yet, because they claim that the shipping companies won&#39;t ship them to the stores. How did you get the replacement phones? Other carriers and Best Buy seem to have them in stock. I am very disappointed with AT&amp;T."
"Dope video, Marques!"
Thank you for continuously making the best reviews on Youtube!<br>Respect from Croatia!
Where did you get that tshirt from? :D
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a> *ip68 don&#39;t lie to people"
Cool tshirt
"Iphone 6s still rockin&#39; .it doesnt explode,  no lags even 5years or even forever i think. Quality of iphone is better than samsung which released phone i think everyday samsung is producing phone very fast samsung s8 is coming already 😂. But the super amoled is still the best feature of samsung for me."
please review iphone 7 plus too!!!:((((
dislike = apple fanboy<br>LOL 😋😂<br><br>calm down ✌
"Dude, where did you get the tshirt??"
anyone who still tries saying &quot;the note 7 sucks because they all just explode&quot; is retarded tbh
"&quot;It&#39;s pretty much using the highest end parts available.&quot; Yeah, that&#39;s why the iPhone 7 smokes it in every speed test."
"As a reluctant iPhone user, I have to admit Samsung do seem to be making better phones. I will however say that this year the iPhone plus does have a better camera system overall for my own uses."
KA BOOOMM

Honestly...why would anyone dislike this video? 🤔
irish scanner is not working for asian people dut to small eyes
I almost dislike the video for the JIF pronunciation.
but it explodes!
can you please tell from where you got that joker Tshirt.???i really like it.
"Thanks for great video. Marques, I have a problem with my note 7 and I&#39;m not sure how to fix this: auto dim and proximity sensors work only for few minutes after restart and then they stop. When making phonecalls I keep pressing my ear against the phone and thus changing s... up, starting apps etc. Auto brightness dims my screen all the way down where if im outside i can see anything. only remedy is to restart but it only helps for few minutes. tried back to factory several times with clean installs (not from backup). still nothing. please help."
Some how you always make the videos look better when we thought you had reached max level for crispiness but I guess not
thumbs up if you&#39;re watching this on a note 7!! still haven&#39;t exchanged my phone either! Long Live the explosion rebellion!
"+marquesbrownlee thank you for the review I hope you see this really important comment.<br><br>I&#39;m actually a user of the first batch of Note 7s, black edition, and actually my battery life is pretty substantial no matter what I do (except for recording, video etc.) I&#39;m mentioning this because an article came out saying the new Note 7s with the green indicators have battery drain issues.<br><br>Other than that I also want to touch on the lag issue. I noticed it was very &#39;noticeable&#39; during the first week and a half of use. After that the issue is not really there anymore unless I reality stress the phone out. Anyways I hope you reply 😁 thanks. Great review.<br><br>Terence."
"apple is better to be honest, why? i still use an iphone 4s and it was way back 6 years ago and its still use by many people. Is there any android phone back 6 years ago still use? Apple have a quality and can still be use for years, Android will just amze you at first but when time comes, it will lag. Just like my mom&#39;s S2. its broke as hell"









































Awesome video as always! Where can i buy that Joker t-shirt?
You said it is IP67 but I think it is IP68 if I&#39;m not mistaken! And thanks for the awesome videos. I absolutely make sure to watch every new one. Keep up the awesome work 👍🏼
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m27s"">1:27</a> I always said that since the edge bullshit came about, it&#39;s not your fault, it&#39;s fucking poor product design aimed at peaople stupid enough to ignore that one of the main things a phone should do properly is being held."
there where no explosions. only burning. do you actually know what the explosion is an explosion look like?
"The best review of the note7. Dream phone thoh😍😍, ill just buy the note 5 for $500 or HTC 10 for $550"
"Great review :) <br>So you presented the replaced phone at the end of the video, while you did the review with the old one! Cool :D<br>Can those green battery indicators get a skin from the themes?"
cool...nice t shirt
Plz do a honor 8 review marques.
"I like this phone and if i were to start new i would get it...however i bought an Apple Watch over a year ago and really like it, so sticking with Apple for the time being!"
Where is that wallpaper from
"Dude. You have big hands, you make Note7 look so small while it looks so gigantic on my hands."
incoming stupid explosion jokes
This phone is shit! Nokia N95 all the way🤗
"hello Marques... You made a mistake at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m30s"">7:30</a>.. Note 7 is IP68 rated.. not IP67... plz correct yourself.."


Every Samsung phone review video has a lot of comments about how Apple sucks <br><br>While most Apple iphone videos are just talking how happy they are:) <br><br>So? Samsung fans are kind of a show off...<br>But Samsung&#39;s still great:) and Apple Too:)
I&#39;m tired of samsung but they are the only company making a waterproof phablet :[ i want htc to make something like the note 7. touchwiz is garbage.
where can i find his joker shirt design?
Does changing resolution improve battery life?
Am now fully used to the new intro Tune YOO!🎵
"You said Jif on purpose. You didn&#39;t think I would notice, but oh boy, I noticed."
u r so fast man
kaboom!
Did he just say &#39;JiF&#39; instead of &#39;GIF&#39;......
And the headphone jack..  😂😂😂
Allahu Akbar!
note7 is the best phone
You should review the honor note 8 people have been saying it is a flagship killer but most videos are in Chinese so a video from you would be great
iPhone is still the best phone in the world. Android sucks.




best review ever
"technically though, camera wise, this phone is a downgrade from a previous phone they had. K Zoom debatably had THE best camera on a phone, next to the Lumia... 1070 i believe."
any idea where I can get a SIM FREE Note 7? My Note 4 is on its last leg..
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TEAMCRISPY"">#TEAMCRISPY</a>"

where can I get that wallpaper on the home screen?
Did he really say JIF? This calls for war!
that tee tho
hey mkbhd ... can you review Samsung Gear IconX .... your follower from india :)
kaboom
if there isn&#39;t there should be a exynos version
This review is lit!<br>Phone looks so hot!<br>They&#39;re having a firesale!<br>That&#39;s... all.
Isn&#39;t it IP68 rating instead of IP67 ?


any comments on how easily it scratches? mine was scratched within the first week and I babied it!
He said &quot;JIF&quot;...<br><br>...SO TRIGGERED!!!
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m35s"">3:35</a> what if it exploded"
Not a good review.. Yes it&#39;s a good phone.. But look at phonebuff <br>For its price its a complete disaster
"Its IP 68, not 67. The iPhone 7 is IP67."
Could you please add a few points on the audio quality using headphones? With such an expensive phone does it do a great job with the sound quality?


jif??? Why you do this to us Marques? :/
"Did u hear that from the Man himself it got d best camera and screen on any smartphone period if MKBHD can say that....then am done <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23haters"">#haters</a>"
epic t-shirt man 😍
"If the people dumping on Samsung actually took the time to do some research, they&#39;d realize that Samsung only makes the handsets. The batteries are made by a separate company out of China. Is this a black eye for Samsung, you bet. Will they survive it, of course they will."
You&#39;re the only reviewer I can count on for an unbiased opinion.
am I the only one who sing alone the &quot;wow~~&quot; when intro rolls in?
ＢＯＯＯＭ！
i wish i could buy this smartphone :D inshallah i will buy it :)
hey man where did you get that sweet joker shirt!?
late asf
but did it explode? I want bang for my buck
"I&#39;ve gotta know how you fixed up your audio in that big &#39;ol theatre of a room. Or did you already do a video on that, that I missed?"
was waiting for your review. ty now i know my next phone will be note 7
I never buy Samsung because of lag issues.
I prefer S7 Edge over Note 7












"a little off topic, but the thumbnail kinda looks like a couple of spreaing legs, lol."
Hi
"noooo, he said jif ...<br>great video tho"

mkbhd probably vapes
FirePhone!!!
"ahh its so powerful and good, MARQUES IPHONE 7 BEAT NOTE 7 A WHOLE 2 LAPS AHEAD, IPHONE 7 IS TWO TIMES FASTER THAN NOTE 7, PROOF ON PHONE BUFF CHANNEL"
"Great video as always! On an unrelated not, I&#39;d really appreciate it if you could share where you got your awesome t-shirt from... :)"
idk what to get the iPhone 7 is just so much faster but I like the ecosystem and features of the note 7











"Pls dont use this, we want you to make videos and your hand wil explode when you ise it and then you cant edit videos"

Whatss da link for da wallpaper???????
hi MKBHD like the way you present your videos. a quick question can u make a comparison video between iphone 7 plus and note 7 please. cant decide between the both. thank you.
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m47s"">7:47</a> Sony Xperia says hi"
I still can&#39;t get past the experience that my friend had with the recall.  His carrier gave him a hard time about returning it.  Maybe I will rethink this one.
Note 7 or iPhone 7Plus???
Note 7 is IP68. Just saying;)
doesn&#39;t noe 7 explodes?










i think its IP 68.
Damn day t-shirt
Nice review Marques!
wow this review sure is bomb 😂
IP68 not 67
Is anyone else having a hard time with Verizon? I have been out there 3 times and they told me I was placed on a waiting list. I called them today and they told me that they only had 2 phones in stock ...idk it seems sketchy to me
And you made me reconsider getting the refund and getting the iPhone 7 plus.. I&#39;ll have to think about it again.. thanks Marques
Watch out. It may blast.
I just bought the brand new iPhone 7! 😍 And it&#39;s really helping me to lose weight!!!💪 Now I can&#39;t afford food for the next 2 months..
Has anyone experienced oneplus3 dash charger making a buzzy noise while charging? Is it normal or should I be concerned after all those notr7 explosions?
This phone is so godly it explodes when mortals touch it
my review: good phone. smaller battery. I will wait until price lowers
hey mkbhd <br>u got the desk
The twats still removed System UI Tweak... Fuck I hate that I can&#39;t hide the alarm icon.
why would recommend a phone which is exploding? even all the airlines puts a disclaimer not to carry a note 7 while travelling!
ip67? or the actual ip68
"Your T-shirt is my desktop wallpaper :3 <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JustinMaller"">#JustinMaller</a>"
Rich kid marques
I like the part where he reviews the phone
"Best phone of the year, regardless of the battery troubles. If only Sammy had included removable battery, this whole thing wouldn&#39;t have been a problem. Also, there were a lot of false reports."
"If you hold it and you touch the screen, it is a design flaw. You are not &#39;holding it wrong&#39;."


What about the power saving modes?
MKBHD i am waiting for iphone 7 plus review
So late..!!!
Note 7 vs iPhone 7 plus please
"great vid! who else saw the car moving into the shot at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=6m09s"">6:09</a> ahaha"
Where can I get that shirt?
"so,u haven&#39;t changed your note 7 yet,right?"
Can you make a video on jaybird X2 vs Jaybird freedom. Drop a like if you want this to happen
Can you do a video on the difference between iphone 7 vs samsung galaxy s7 vs note 7 ?<br>And on iphone 6 vs samsung galaxy s6? <br>please
How about bloatware or apps that can&#39;t be uninstalled? My S4 is packed with those shit apps. Is the Note 7 packed with that crap too?
Does it blend ?
jiff?
"Nice, I&#39;ve been waiting for your review."
Fast? lol &quot;xda embarrassing real world performance article&quot; says enough.
"when I saw the 7 i actaully thought it was a review of the iphone 7. MKBHD, why did it take so long to publish this review?"
Hahah that elephant shot 😂😂😂 you still regret for editing that 😂😂😂
I canceled my pre order for Note 7 because of the battery. Im waiting for iPhone 7 Plus.








































I got one word to describe it and I am gonna spell it out for you : B E A U T Y !!<br><br>wwe fans would totally get the reference

Note 7 is the best Android phone and it even looks better has a greater battery capacity than the iphone 7 plus<br>But it explodes
"exploding or not, let&#39;s just admit that display is insanely crisp"
first person to reply is gao








"Nice shirt (Justin Maller?), nice phone."
But does it have dual front-facing speakers? Still no!
After spending 900$ on Note 7 i have to prove  that this phone won&#39;t explode....Wtf go buy 7plus or v20
all black so swag😎
Nice tshirt...  Pls make it a giveaway.. Am ur biggggest fan...
"whats your opinion when it comes to an iphone v android. i feel iPhone overall runs soo much better, androids have their specs and hardware but everyday use ios and iphone just runs better"
And I have a Nokia 1100...
roast on iPhone 7 haha lol
My internet speed is 1% of mkbhd&#39;s internet speed.
"I really wouldn&#39;t recommend &#39;fast charging&#39; any device often, and certainly not one which doesn&#39;t have a replaceable battery."
"After almost 8 years with Samsung (s1, s3, s4, Note 1, Note 2, Note 3, s6, S7 edge) this is the first problem they encounter. No big deal i&#39;ll wait. <br>I tried the iphone 7 plus just to see if it was possible but i stopped at the screen. The screen, the colors were washed out. Next to my s7 edge it looked like a downgrade for 1100 euro. No difference with the camera, i still find my phone capture me better. No wireless charger (i use it everyday at my office and home). <br>The iphone 7 plus seems huge compare to my phone even if i have the same screen size. and the black color wasn&#39;t available untill november. <br><br>I&#39;ve tried LG, but i didn&#39;t like the UI. HTC 10 was good but the battery life is too weak. We don&#39;t have a lot of motorola phones here in France. More reason to stay samsung.<br>I must admit the HTC 10 was very tempting, the ausio quality is really on point. I hope samsung improves that with the s8 and Note 8."
really curious how the V20 and OP3 stack up against this
talk to you guys in the next one and <b>****Boom*****</b>
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=5m40s"">5:40</a> You said Jif.. im unsubscribing.<br><br><br><br><br><br>jk.. its pronounced Gif.. pls Marques"
ip68.. not ip67 like iphone 7.
why would you review a bomb?
Someday... Probably when Note 11 will be out...
give us more tesla
thats cool!!
my phone&#39;s maximum charge is 60% :(
Its the best phones for power users. Just absolutely nailed it with the power/design balance. But the exploding battery has made this a deal breaker for a lot. Where I&#39;m from the note7 isn&#39;t allowed in flights. Sigh. I hope the Note 8 goes through better QC before release.
best tech guy i have ever seen
Have you noticed any heating with the new Note 7 during heavy usage? I&#39;ve noticed mine getting warm sometimes and don&#39;t know how normal that is. Especially when my old iPhone 4S sometimes became nearly untouchable... &gt;_&gt;
"Could you start taking note of the phone prices in your reviews. While yes, the Note7 is awesome, it doesn&#39;t exist in a vacuum. It&#39;s not worth its asking price when compared with the likes of LG V20 and Oneplus 3."

everything is great ...<br>the battery thing is fixed ...<br>but that stupid TouchWiz still exists.
why this late?
Hey Bro can you make a new video on Sony Xperia X Compact!!!
wtf is a jif? But otherwise a really good video mkbhd
After owning a galaxy s6 for over a year i am sure i wont buy another samsung again ):
"In all cases of the note 7 &quot;exploding&quot;, the fire department hasn&#39;t been able to point the cause directly to the note 7. They said it might&#39;ve been the cause but it&#39;s not certain. Also, since the note 7 has usb-c, it takes more power from the charger and when you use a non-certified third party cable, that will cause major problems for the battery. Instead of bitching about all of this, I would rather praise Samsung for taking back ALL note 7&#39;s and exchanging then for a new batch. Apple hasn&#39;t done that ever and mostly will not in the future."

Can I ask where you got your shirt from Marques. :&#39;(
that bundle of lightning earphones XD

You Crapple kids coming here to troll need to go back to your iHiss 7 and your iBend 6s from that half eaten fruit company.

"marques, does the new, fixed note 7 overheat? i&#39;ve heard rumors of it doing that."

"Oh man you can make screen caps into delicious peanutbutter? Tbh regardless of the possibility of horrible maiming, this is my dream phone. Can&#39;t wait to be able to afford one in four years."
is that a d-brand shirt?
Why do you have icons with background?.
"Samsung galaxy note 7(after patch): QUADHD, Water Proof, 3500mah, HeadPhone jack. 64 gigs out of the box with A SD CARD SLOT WOOO.   <br>plus iris scanner.(Perfect for winters), Camera is WIDE angle for great for selfies. Rear is speedy auto focus, dual pixels KILLS the iphone 7. BTW if you are swimming or its RAINING  or even in a bath. WATER MAKES THE FINGERPRINT SCANNER UNUSABLE"



















guess you can use the lagging in a horror movie when trying to call help 911 and the note 7 is trying to wake up... my note 2 still rocks 😶
"Pros: great camera, cons; explodes in your hands"
waiting for this since the tweet
"Hi, should I get an iPad Air 2 or sell my iPhone SE and get a Note 7 and sort of morph my devices into one device? Average consumer, just browsing, video, music and office."







This is a hot review. One could say it has explosive potential.
"Samsung phones are really well made with amazing specs and design but just the software is ughh. There&#39;s too many slow animations that really take away from the snappiness of the device. <br>Edit: I used to be an avid rooter and customiser, cyanogenmod, custom bootloaders, android adb etc. So I know about developer options etc. :) Also cool to see everyone discussing their opinions and views"


























"MKBHD, you made us wait for for so long. Anyway, thanks for reviewing the best phone in the world. Nice work Samsung. We stand with Samsung."

You are the best Reviewer
Note7 is only avalible in exynos 8890 octa not in snapdragon 820<br>Do yo noticed in this video
I Love Note series so Much<br>Note 7 is the world most Sexiest and hottest phone thats why it explode!<br><br>iDiot7 Sucks.
samsung galaxy s7 edge vs note 7
niz t-shirt 😎
Can they bring back Google Play Editions? I just want stock Android. Sticking with Google for now.
I am glad that it did not explode while you were testing it.😂
"WTF, it is IP68, not IP67."
BOOM
ip67?? not 68?
"On another note, you have so many subscribers."
Iphone 7plus with a better display and better waterproofing...bam
you like black because you are black :P lol


Great review as always. And that come from an Iphone user.
Make it as fast as an iPhone and you&#39;ve got the best smartphone in the world :P
"when I saw the smoke, I was &quot;Note 7 is about to go Super Saiyan God!!!&quot; 😀"
I never thought I would say this but that DBrand skin actually makes the phone look better.
"From what it can be read, Note7 is IP68, not IP67 as you said :)"
How do you spin your room like that man?
intro song?
Great Review!!
Yep. Still want one.
1st gen Note 7 with the ISIS seal of approval 👍
@marques please provide the link for the tee you are wearing!
Thanks Marques!! from: Samsung CEO
"Hey Marques, what are your views on the ethical issues surrounding the production of electronics in tech?"
IP68
If only Samsung fixed their software. My Galaxy S7 edge is still a lot slower than near stock Android phones e.g. OnePlus 3.
Does anybody think that the lag problem will become more serious? Because if im getting this id want it to last at least 2 years
when you told &#39; holding it wrong&#39; it remember Antennagate
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m19s"">3:19</a> This looks like it was taken by a Galaxy S2<br>This is the problem with vivd screen, photos look great on smartphone but when you view it on TV or computer it&#39;s pretty bad sometimes."
"Damn boy, I need to get some sleep, geez! Thought you&#39;d never do the review, actually. Nice video, as always!"
My God this guy is black
im still here with note 4 hahaa
your recording skills are great man
"nice review, your studio still sounds a little echoey"
hahahahahaha
I&#39;ve 2GB of RAM on my PC! Damn!
Helllooo
This video looks like a heavily produced short film... THAT QUALITY IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL! 😍😍
Despite the camera and updated specs: my rooted nexus 6p still better!

"I&#39;ve never been a fan of the shimmery texture (I guess you&#39;d call it) of the material underneath the glass. It just makes it look worse. If they really have to keep the all glass phone, they should have an option for just plain black or white glass without the shimmer. A matte version would be really awesome."
The airlines don&#39;t care what color your battery icon is. They still have to follow safety procedures regardless.
Ear pod ball..lol.<br>the battery bomb troll is getting lame anyways.
it is ip68 marques
Can someone tell me wether or not the camera does 60fps? Say if I want to shoot or record at 1080p60fps rather than 4k 30fps?

Man ... From where did you get this dope T-shirt ?
"Beside the Explosions, Note 7 is still the Best Looking Phone I had ever seen."
"Sorry the exploding issue has not been fixed as phones are still being recalled and replaced. The damage to Samsung&#39;s reputation cannot be underestimated or fixed overnight nor will it not affect their sales. From a marketing and PR standpoint the exploding issue is a disaster and it will take time for them to regain trust of the market place. It&#39;s a brilliant phone but you wouldn&#39;t trust an expensive Jaguar or Rolls Royce series with a reputation for exploding in hot weather. sadly the Note 7 can now never be considered the best phone of 2016 or the best Galaxy Note ever, that prize will remain with the Note 4 which Samsung still sells to this day. the two Subsequent versions of the Note series have been blown up stylus versions of the  S6 and S7 series albeit with excellent hardware. Shame about the explosions."

Pressed the like button without even playing the video
This phone is tha bomb 👌
I thought Samsung made IP68 Phones this year...
Anyone knows what the BG score used here ?
"galaxy s8 must have a new design language. Even they make a great phone again, if the design is like note7, normal people will recognize the s8 as a exploding note7. 😞😞😞"
It&#39;s not worth it to upgrade from S7 Edge.

So MKBHD doesn&#39;t reply to comments anymore?
nice shirt
"what&#39;s that on ur desk , on ur backgroud during last few seconds"
Good display....shitty OS that lags more and more as time passes.
"Hey Marques, it&#39;s over a month and a half since you uploaded the impression video . Don&#39;t you think you are pretty late to upload this full review ...!  I am not blaming you but most of your subscribers expected this video would came earlier..!😃"


Yo Marques! You should have been wearing some explosive armor protection just in case! <br><br><br>Jk I love Samsung.
It needs palm rejection to stop accidental touches
great video mate

"After all the battery fiasco, Samsung should start giving discounts and gift cards to buy an iPhone 7."
its GIF NOT JIF!!!!
He called it a jif. Unsubscribed. Marques why :(
"no comments on the scratch resistance, MKBHD?"
What is the circular lamp you have on the desk?
"I really like your videos and the quality is so high and you are good inspiring me cause how you do video it inspires a lot of tech people! Nice video bro! Love from Finland, Serbia!"
"hello guys.. note 7 is fantastic. after this busting mess i really don&#39;t get what so great than s7 edge. in few aspects s7 edge got real edge over note 7. maybe battery, ip 67 rating, price and availability."

"&quot;and a headphone jack, of course&quot; 😅DAMN!"
Jif &gt; Gif.
I would never pay that much for a phone.
Great review! Best I&#39;ve seen on YouTube so far!
What do you think of the Moto G4 Plus?
"People saying - well the phone explodes, yes it does, but you can exchange it for free, get a whole new box for free, meaning earphones, charger, etc. etc. plus $20 giftcard, so it&#39;s not all too bad xD and also a brand new phone, so you can even drop the old one if you want to."
using note 4 still runs  well
Ip68*
is it just me or his breathing sound is really getting louder?
"Check out Phonebuff&#39;s battle between the Note 7 and the iPhone 6s. The Note 7 gets LAPPED by the 1yo iPhone 6s in real world performance. It also gets beaten by the iPhone SE, so not even going to compare it with the iPhone 7 or the 7 plus, the latter being its real competitor. Compare MKBHD&#39;s Samsung videos with the iPhone ones and you&#39;ll see a huge unjustified bias. Samsung phones have been performing like shit since their inception. I wonder how much this guy gets paid by Samsung. I used to be a big fan since way back when he did PC reviews, but I&#39;m unsubscribing."
get the moto z play everyone
"This is by far the best Android Phone!<br>By the way Samsung set the charging limit to 80%, is it still safe to charge till 100%?"
Dope shirt!
"when it&#39;s not exploding, it&#39;s actually a pretty good smartphone!! xD"
&quot;The tip is smaller&quot;
imagine a note 7 with ios 10 <b>.</b>
Good review but I had to stop watching out of principle when he said &quot;Jif&quot;.
had some second opinions about buying the note 7 after all the controversy but after watching you review i am definately going to buy it.
iphone &quot;4k camera on a 760p screen&quot;🤔🤔
"ip68, not ip67.. thats the iPhone"
"I really like your reviews,if you answered me I&#39;m gonna get this phone😀"
3 days later... BOOOOMM!!!
Why doesn&#39;t it ignore uninteded touches by the sides?
Just for your safety &quot;give it to me&quot;
Samsung more negative review but iphone lots of positive review lol
Can you distinguish the new one from the explosive one just by looking at the box? Some stores in the philippines doesnt allow phone boxes to be opened before the purchase... Thanks
I miss Fast Lane Daily.
Who&#39;s watching on Samsung Galaxy Note 5??
"Now I get it. Oh yeah, This review is the reason that you could effort a Tesla."
Do any of you guys know why you can&#39;t control zoom in the camera app with the volume rocker because I couldn&#39;t find a way to set that option

did he just say jif??

hi. does anyone know how to keep the mobile data going while on the phone? coz only wifi working while im on the phone. can it be disabled?

What a time to be alive phones with no headphone jack and phone with a time bomb
Well the Note 7 is Fast For Sure In plugging in the headfone jack :P
"Samsung speakers are the reason I don&#39;t get Samsung phones. If they only had front facing speakers, I&#39;d be all over it."
"When u said &quot;Explosions&quot; while mentioning the new features, I was like This could be the Next Bond Gadget!"
it&#39;s a bird it&#39;s a plane o no it&#39;s a galaxy note 7 every body run this place going to blow

"As if the iPhone 7 camera is close to the Samsung s7. Watch supersaf! In brightlight the iPhone 7 is close to it, but in low light or focusing it&#39;s no where near as good as the s7."
Not gonna lie this thing scares me a bit. I&#39;ll probably get an S7 and just wait for the Note 8.
ain&#39;t gonna lie the note 7 is my favourite unfortunate though iPhone fan boys have something to drill us about

LG V20 review.....plz
"if a galaxy note can fit an S Pen in a thin body, then apple has no excuse for removing the headphone jack"
I would prefer converting my screen into a gif instead of a jif
definitely worth to wait for it.
"To all the iSheeps that keep making fun of the problem that has been fixed. At least Samsung themselves made it official, they put their customers first. Apple has had several exploding iPhones, thousands of bent iPhones, hissing iPhones, They never addressed anything. Why? cause their image and $$ is all that they care about. That is the same reason they removed the headphone jack, they don&#39;t give a flying fuck about you sheeps. But you always go back for more."
"Holy shit that wad of earpods at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m16s"">7:16</a> probably costs more than the phone itself!"
money talks
this is the normal Note 7 /: ? i want to buy the Isis edition !
got my new green battery note 7 and now it&#39;s dropping wifi connection. yeah they still got work to do.
i replaced it<br>new note7 <br>the king is back 😙

I like my note7～nice video~
bro you rip every reviewers out in YouTube.. except unbox therapy where i feel you guys move neck to neck.. but still you are thebest reviewer for me!! cheers! :)
Samsung still hasn&#39;t replaced mine... what is taking so long?
Stuffed to the gills !
It ain&#39;t any fast. The OnePlus 3 definitely kills this.! xD
Question. Why don&#39;t you review any Sony Smartphone? :D

"Apple x Trump: Too much money, less useful features with plenty of problems.<br>Samsung x Hillary: Worth the price, too many features but a few problems."
Does the new Note 7 with the green battery indicator still has overheating issues while charging?
Boom
Looks like I won&#39;t have our Fire Extinguisher as a Room buddy when Id finally get this baby next summer
Marques.... the best YouTube reviewer !
We&#39;d like to weigh in on the explosions so you cannot fast charge a lithium ion this is a problem I think what they&#39;ve done is obviously they&#39;ve dial down the fast charging a bit on the recalled handsets but that&#39;s primarily the issue here is there still trying to solve the battery issue by charging it quicker when what we need to do is we need to come up with new battery technology and it exists but it&#39;s not cheap enough
Think Ima get my mom this phone for Christmas.
This phone is the bomb loool
That ball of headphones is awesome
Samsung galaxy note 7 is IP 68 water and dust resistant
When Samsung makes better bombs than Isis.
How much did you get from Samsung for this video?
No htc 10 desire sorry
"Got my replacement yesterday, so happy. Also Ip68 bro not 67"
Most of the explosion stories were faked
I was gonna make a Galaxy Note 7 joke but <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I didn&#39;t want to blow away the crowd
Sweet bro

"Is he using an Icon Pack? If so, which one is it??"
that shirt tho
what if the waterproofing causes the phone to build up heat because there&#39;s no ventilation?
big fan...  your reviews are always on point. keep up the good work. this is Godson from Ghana
happy he didnt get launched to the moon
funny how I was awake to see this.
"As always, great review man! thanks for sharing..."
marques says gif wrong.........
what if it explodes on ur hand?! :P this phone is big and u make it look like the s7..! :/ :P
Could you explain water proof phones in detail. IP67 &amp; IP68? And how water proof are they?

"The occasional lag might be due to DOZE. Try to keep system UI, some of the samsung UI stuff and regularly used apps out of DOZE list. I did this in my phone and it stopped lagging after minutes of idle time."

Good Work mkbhd!!!!!
Hello... When i can  buy in this days the version 2 of the note?  In usa?
latest vid is pretty cool lmk what u think
Make the weird <br>Kind of tech world a <br>Benchmark of exposed <br>Haha fun reviews of <br>Dong
"That wild #114 Tangela that appeared at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m18s"">7:18</a> though."

soooo did the phone ever heat up during use?  this happened with techno buffalo&#39;s review unit but that was before the fixing so I want to know about that<br>I would also like to know if the phone can stay fine while charging in really hot places <br>I live in Oman and it&#39;s a hot country in the Middle East so that&#39;s important to me
"would you recommend me to have a SAMSUNG GALAXY NOTE 7? I manage social media account fot individuals and conpanied. Am in Uganda, Africa. We have dusty roads and rain. I just placed an order for a SAMSUNG S7 ACTIVE."

"Samsung doesn&#39;t make sense. large, beautiful displays, crappy speakers. large batteries, crap battery management. lots of ram, again, crappy management.<br><br>on my s6, beautiful phone and buttons except the home button isn&#39;t straight and os wobbly and makes lots of noise...."
"Love the review, while most Apple fan boys are just bashing Samsung, you did a fair and honest review. Much appreciated!!"
"Great review bro, I will buy it for sure. <br>can you please tell me what you use for the Montage? and what the program you used to make a note on the video?"
"a great phone and a great review. if I had a little more money I&#39;d get the note 7. if it only had stereo speakers and an IR-port it&#39;d be the best phone, imo."
nice video MKBHD still samsung galaxy note 7 for me.. great camera and great display..thumbs up note 7..
Dope phone though
Last month I got an Asus Zenphone 3 which besides the curved screen match the specs and built of this one phone. It is about half the cost! Thank you for the  review.
I like ur t-shirt ! Where you buy it ?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=3m38s"">3:38</a>am in Ohio. Stayed up for this review. One of my favorite videos thus far — I&#39;ve been strongly considering testing out android after being a devoted Apple and iOS user. I&#39;m sticking around for this tenth anniversary, if it doesn&#39;t drop my drawers I&#39;m going to be immediately considering the Note."
Is that retina scanner reads crctly are it simply does recognize the pic.... of the eyes of the owner have u tried it mkbhd ...
"I want to see the Google Pixel before I make my choice. Any way you can get your hands on one, Marques? ;)"
thanks for this honest review. i really want to buy a Note 7 because i&#39;m still rocking with Note 2 for more 3 years.
Does it explode ?
Will it matter now mkbhd..???

Laaaaaaag explode😭
i think it&#39;s IP68 not 67
"I Put my Note7 on ice, waiting for a new one. So in the mean time I&#39;m  using the iPhone 6S Plus, my carrier gave me as a loaner. So far, its good for a loaner but i love the Note 7 minus the uncertainty that my phone might go Allahu akbar on me."

Hope your phone wont get blasted
so- in short- you mean..... &quot;APPLE CAN SUCK IT &quot;
what took you more than a month for the review Marques?

It&#39;s GIF not Jif. Sorry someone had to point that out.
It&#39;s actually IP68 certified bra...just fyi
Do you know who we are without MKBHD?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>We are Harambe.
"best display best camera in any smartphone. best phone overall. yeah it has a bad reputation as the exploding phone. but feature wise, camera wise this is still the best. this is still my dream phone. if google didn&#39;t do the region restriction with their appstore I would take the note 7 anyday everyday. thank you for the awesome review mkbhd"
"Beast of a phone! But I&#39;m happy with my S7 Edge.<br>BTW it&#39;s IP68, not 67.."
"there are fresh news that the battery drains fast and the phone easily overheats, and i&#39;m talking about the new &quot;Safe&quot; Note 7 ... can you confirm that ? I hope he read this comment"
"what do you think about the new grace UX? Also, between the S7 edge and note 7, whats the key difference and the reason to buy note 7 over S7 edge other than the stylus? i mean S7 has bigger battery and the same camera. And it doesnt explode!"
Still no palm rejection. It&#39;s really annoying to have to hold your phone a certain way. I imagine it would be even more annoying with that curved display.
There are 4 exploded note 7 in China (including one from Hong Kong)<br>and Samsung still announces that the Chinese version is safe... <br>i may become a former Samsung fan.
good and fair review.... I love this phone but sound quality. tks for this good vid.
have u Watched Huawei Mate 8 ?
Android Authority&#39;s reviewers should learn how to do reviews from Marques.
I want that t shirt plz send me the link i realy loved it
"First time I&#39;ve seen a very very biased review from MKBHD, sorry man but not cool. I still am a huge fan but the bias towards Samsung is quite literally visible."

"been an iphone fanboy since they released the first one until iphone 5, it was really good back then, then a friend introduced me to android and  after that i never looked back. i had the first note, s5, s6  edge,s7 edge and the first batch of note 7,wvwn theres a battery exploding problem i chose to get the note 7 replacement.because samsung and android are awesome."














This dude is late by more than a month.
Explosions
somebody noticed that huge earbuds ball?

That will explain why u didn&#39;t do a review a months or two on the note s7 it a alright phone but still think it slow so it not good for me to purchase I need to find out how to become a product tester to do reviews really but any way back to your vid I love the joke in it. It was fun also like your Snapchat about as well Brilliant as always keep up the good work p.s love what u done with your studio apartment jealous dude lol have a nice day from Mist

"I saw MKBHD ,i click"
Did he just troll iphone??😂😂😂
IP68
Things we learned in this video:<br>He has a massive tangled ball of Earpods
iPhone 6plus has its &quot;bend&quot; and now galaxy note 7 has its &quot;hand&#39;s grenade&quot; what a nice features
"Still waiting for my replacement unit! (Turkey) I do not have any backup device either! I believe samsung will manage to send my replacement unit faster than my backup device :D Anyways note 7 is a fantastic device, I would only hope for a bigger battery. On the other hand there are rumours around about the new devices for overheating and rapid battery draining. Marques I would like to ask you, if you have noticed any of these with your replacement device?"
You said &quot;it&#39;s easy to make jokes about it&quot;  and still everyone is here for their minute of fame and easy jokes.
"i like your shirt,just saying"
All the people hating samsung and shit but did the explosion happened to anyone here? I don&#39;t think so and even then i bet they got compensated and Samsung did recall on all of them
What!! So weird I just searched specifically to see if you posted this review about 2 hours ago and bam.. here it is on my homepage.
how about the the audio output of this phone through the headphone jack for hifi music? is it any good?
whoa i&#39;m early
Great Video Mr Marques!<br>worth the wait!
felt like it was sponsored by Samsung.
marry me 😍😍😍
"hey, man! where is the link for the skin?"
Is the phone available for purchase again?
Lamw😒😒😒
hey Marques which phone should i buy ??<br>i am thinking of <br>htc 10<br> pixel xl <br>note 7 <br>or<br> iphone 7plus<br><br>i am a very heavy user <br>before this i had a op2 and is slowed it down
do u use the snapdragon or exynos? because i heard that the exynos got a better battery life
owh my screen just exploded
"its IP 68 ,not IP 67, hope u made that correct loot at 7.30"
That shirt! 😱🃏👍

"Dont care what people have to say,this phone is amazing and best overall."
I have a  Note 7 and I love it but my favorite thing is this video was MKBHD&#39;s iphone headphones rubber band ball
the quality of the videos you make are just 🔥🔥🔥
ip68 not ip67
Excellent review as always. Do you prefer the Note 7 or the 7 Plus?
is this replace or old?
"&quot;And my favorite thing about the Note 7, the battery li...&quot; BOOOOMMMMM!!!!"
I&#39;ll stick with my note 5 until the note 8 comes out. Getting a slight upgrade isn&#39;t worth the money.
MKBHD the kinda guy to get turned on by a crispy toast!!! Just kidding love your videos man
"Explosions? What an absurdly ignorant and stupid thing to say. &quot;Burning&quot; isn&#39;t an explosion, as the biggest reviewer you shouldn&#39;t mix stupid memes and Twitter bullshit with a review.<br><br>Stop being so overdramatic. This happens to iPhones, &quot;hundreds&quot; of reported cases just like &quot;hundreds&quot; were reported for Samsung but iSheep are disgustingly autistic and petty.<br><br>Imbeciles."






now new one or old one ....... samsung really a good company but but but .... dependency is not good... I mean parts that have been using .. like battey...
i lost 5% battery while watching this woah and dont forget the lag
Nice t-shirt..
How about that it only charges up to 60% ??
Best Phone of 2016
Best Phone of 2016
Hey +Marques did u encounter any micro scratches on the phone u replaced... there are rumorurs note 7s are scratching very easily??
A great phone indeed. I am using it from the 4th of August. Had no issues. Got a replacement new one with green battery icon 2 days back. This is the best phone money can buy right now.
"@<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m18s"">7:18</a> HOLY BALL OF LIGHTNING EARPODS!"

"@mkbhd how&#39;s the battery on the new replaced phones, heard a lot of negative talk. Is it great or ?"
Where do i get this T-Shirt?
I was expecting not to win a giveaway on this one.
This phone is the BOMB! I like
I love my blue note 7. best phone I have ever owned. camera speed and quality is incredible.
MKBHD plz can u make a video on Samsung notebook 9 pro
"You like to take your time for your reviews, I like that. Sometimes it&#39;s not important to have THE first review of a product out there... but this was a bit out of time even by your standards haha I guess you were waiting to get your non-exploding unit from Samsung to post it."

Samsung present Note 7 at 2.August <del>--</del>&gt;MKBHD Review  26.September ??? WTF MKBHD ..
The best review in all youtuber.
Time to hang those Facets on...
Love the shirt you wearing. Where you bought it?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Mkbhd"">#Mkbhd</a> please review the iphone 7,7 plus watch 2 series can&#39;t wait for it and also tell which is better between note7 and iphone 7 ,7 plus"
So can i go swimming with this phone and take underwater photos?
can the explosion happen in Samsung note 5?
the elephant pun from snapchat ;)
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamnosleep"">#teamnosleep</a>. Was stoked to hear what you had to say about it with the recall. Great video as always"
"can we not discuss the elephant in the room, that pun.."
"dude all your complaints are gone with the new one, it definitely don&#39;t lag in any way, it&#39;s super smooth, and the battery life is much improved, i didn&#39;t see you point any of that out."


I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth it. It has the exact same specs and camera as the Galaxy S7 or S7 edge. The only difference is it&#39;s slightly larger and has a stylus. There no other &quot;crazy features&quot; unique to the Note.
waited for this video for a long time. Finally
thanks mkbhd
"+mkbhd could u do an explained video on Samsung opted to take away the ir blaster when they were the ones that brought it to market... Also why are Wall adapters so ugly? When u look at the phone you see a sexy phone w curves and slants but then u pull the charging port out and it&#39;s clunky, ugly and oversized"
the video look so real even at 480p on my u2412m
"at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m17s"">7:17</a> earphones rolled up.. a jab at iphone 7 ? :P"
I love this phone over the iPhone 7. Best photos out there rn minus the battery and the ui but that&#39;s a plus too for the s pen features etc. So cheers I will get it when it come backs to the Singapore market hehe
JIF JIF JIF JIF JIF
you did not just say &quot;jif&quot;
love ur vids......btw where do u live iwanna meet u once??😊😊
Man I want this phone but will android ever stop laggy so badly ?!!
how about the second elephant in the room the fact that the replaced note 7&#39;s have a even more deminished battery life I personally know I had and original and now I have a replace one I get a quarter less battery time on a full charge
And here I was thinking your phone might&#39;ve exploded. Dope review tho!
iPhone 7 plus or note 7 can&#39;t decide?
Why do digital cameras still use the 4:3 ratio? Most displays these days are 16:9 or wider
make your own gif?....whhaaaaatt
Are they finally re-available to buy?
"&quot;...and Explosions.&quot; - MKBHD, 2016"
You forgot to mention power saving modes which can give you up to 2 days if you choose max.
"Hi MKHB,<br><br>iam using LG G4 and planning to buy Iphone 7 plus. is it worth upgrade or do u suggest any other. And wat about google&#39;s 2016 flagship. should i wait until its release?"
looks like someone was hired to do some damage control :)
KA-BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
👍🏻
"Damn those Apple earpods @<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=7m17s"">7:17</a> what a trol"

where did you get that T-shirt from??? @mkbhd
finally
why now MARQUES BROWNLEE????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
still the best phone of 2016.
very crisp and neat video like always
Note 7 blew the smartphone market away!!
you are so biased towards samsung phones.
its because of this review that I am going to get a Note 7. Keep up the good work MB!
That ball made of Lightning Headphone. LOL
Isn&#39;t it IP68 not IP67?
this is twice now marque... its not ip67 its ip68...
This phone is as explosive as a phone can get!
everything was smooth... until JIF. JIF JIF JIF JIF JIF JIF
You should mention Samsung Pay.   It&#39;s so great.
I&#39;m tempted to put a nuke as my wallpaper when my replacement arrives.
It&#39;s about time u came around  😆😆😆😆😆
rumor has it that mkbhd would reply if you&#39;re this early?
Cool video. ...<br>I like the t-shirt you wearing. ...
Marques! That wallpaper please!!!!
When is Samsung going to tell At&amp;t to fuck off with their death star logo.
Would love to see the camera shootout between note 7 and iPhone 7+.
ip68!!! not ip67
Isn&#39;t it IP68 certified? You said IP67 though...
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=0m28s"">0:28</a>. Must be Wednesday..."
Good to know @mkbhd is safe and sound after reviewing the phone
I now know why note 7 is exploding....i think they all got possessed by techrax
"Hey man.. not sure how you didn&#39;t have performance problems. I&#39;ve had the phone for a few weeks now and it lags everyday. To the point where I don&#39;t want to use it. Very frustrating, especially Snapchat or chrome"
Can&#39;t believe you said jif...
Still the best there is today except that it doesn&#39;t have the  IR blaster anymore. pls put it back Sammy!
"Very professional, MKBHD. Keep up with the awesome videos!"
"Hey, was just wondering, seeing that the S8 will be launching early next year. Will it be a better idea to wait for that, or get the note 7? Thanks"
This video is 3 weeks after almost every other Note 7 review and doesn&#39;t include the features like the new secure locker etc. Overall a bit disappointing.
MKBHD the pinnacle of quality videos.
I heard some kind of vibrating phone in your video
Don&#39;t you think you&#39;d get more views and likes if you upload a tad bit earlier?
There have been reports of the replacement note 7&#39;s overheating. They should pull this product until all of the issues have been resolved!
"hey can you give away Note 7 it&#39;s a nice idea ,hope so....✌"
hey are u a patrol head ?
Did he say Jif? Ugh
"Been waiting for this video for ages, glad it&#39;s finally here 👍"
"Great video! I didn&#39;t have any problems with my first Note7, but I exchanged it anyways because it&#39;s better to be safe than aflame, lol. I got my new Note7 &amp; it&#39;s still just as perfect!"
EXPLODE PHONE
seems like motorola lock screen notifications - active display
"In <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m51s"">1:51</a> that&#39;s what happens when you tap on the marshmallow logo in about phone??"
"hey,doesnt note 7 has ip68 certification?"
iPhone 7 is better 👍🏻
Thanks mate!
I feel like the exynos version of this phone is the one to get.
I find your lack of explosion jokes disturbing.
My name is jafar <br>I come from afar <br>There&#39;s a Note 7 in my car Allahu akbar
Hey MKBHD can u please REVIEW &quot;MOTO G4 PLUS&quot;...🙏🏻
Did u design that shirt ?
That Model S vs. Huracan vid tho
"it has a rating of IP68, not IP67"
MKBHD Samsung Squad !!!!where are you at
BOOOOOOOOM!
"I&#39;m sick of that fking explosion joke! They has already fixed that issue! At least they don&#39;t forgot to put headphone jack.. Yeah their chipGate, BendGate, what so ever gate, they don&#39;t even responsible on that! Apple iPhone also blow up!! Still no one bat an eye on thatt!! Ohh newest issue..  Those speaker grill that on ip7 should be place for the jack either side are fake! Hahahahahha"
Honestly Samsung killed it this year and the iPhone 7 was kinda a slouch and not really worth upgrading this year but I&#39;m curious what they&#39;ll do next year for their 10th anniversary phone because I think it will substantially better

Crispiest Video af.🔥
I enjoy watching your videos .
where did you buy that tshirt?????
I&#39;m waiting for mine :(
incoming explosion jokes...
I NED THAT JOKER SHIRT WHERE IS IT FROM
Thanks for review.. 🙋🙋
should i get it or wait for the new Nexus from HTC Marques?
I&#39;d rather have a grenade at least it doesn&#39;t explode by itself. Frag Grenade &gt; Note 7
the software looks super slow 😐
"my name is jarfar,<br>i come from a far,<br>i have a note 7 in my car<br>allah hu akbar!"
by far the best looking phone
"Another clear and neat video with great voice :)<br>A bit sad for SS Note7 with the battery, speaker and... explosion :(. Might choose the edge 7 for the battery but still missing the stylus pen :("
"NO thanks, sticking with our preorder for the iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black."
if it only wasn&#39;t so expensive
so this &quot;power&quot; user phone lags? nice!
Bit old?
rocking again
It&#39;s kinda scary that one little &#39;defect&#39; could almost ruin a Great running company. SMH.
is that true that all Samsung&#39;s becoming laggy? even flagships








"@<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV70CxFlx7w&amp;t=1m30s"">1:30</a> it&#39;s a shame apple has patented the function where thumb touches the screen you can still use your finger to intetact with the screen. Next time apple might patent the air we breathe so we can to pay apple to stay alive."
FYI it is IP68 water resistant.
"Disapointing battery life, lags,  screen scratches,  expensive and yet recommended ? Weird..."

"I&#39;ve been delaying an upgrade from my trusty Note3 to newer Note phones because I use microSD expansion, USB3, and replaceable batteries.<br><br>I have the external battery charger accessory for the Note3 from Samsung and 3 batteries. When out and about I carry the phone and a spare battery (in the battery case included with the charger) while the 3rd battery is at home in the charger. If I&#39;m going to be gone longer than 2 batteries may last I can unplug the charger and use it as an additional battery case.<br><br>Replaceable battery and external charger from Samsung are all the Note7 doesn&#39;t provide that I want. I&#39;m going to try upgrading to it and see if I can live with the limited battery capacity.<br><br>Also, if the Note7 had a replaceable battery then Samsung and Note7 customers would only have needed to replace the battery, not the whole phone. Wouldn&#39;t that have been much simpler, more convenient, and less expensive all around?<br><br>Samsung: Bring back replaceable batteries!"
WHERE can i find that gr8 T shirt ?!damn sick man
damn mark ur reviews are soooo good I love it....from top to bottom it&#39;s PERFECT loved the video👌
"Really wish you could Custom ROM this, absolutely despise TouchWiz."

"The Note 7 &quot;bomb jokes&quot; are played out. They were funny, but not anymore. <b>Also, GIF is pronounced JIF!</b>"
Yet another great MKBHD review.<br>Keep the videos going

"Those of you who are arguing wether Samsung or iPhone is better than one another, please stfu. Reading through these comments raise my blood pressure."

Hey what&#39;s up guys Scarce here...
"Unbiased review as always, best part I love about you dude. Cheers.<br>Samsung made a mistake and they owned up to it, took looses and didn&#39;t leave their customer base hanging. Unlike another rotten apple of a company did when faced with the same explosive embarrassment in the past.<br><br>Keep keeping it real man. Peace."
"Okay, but is it worth the upgrade from my Note 2?<br><br>I think I&#39;d really miss the <b>beautiful</b> Verizon logo on the home button, but the possibility of an explosion might make up for that."
Can I charge the new note 7 with a powerbank??? Is it safe??
"you use a good note, the green battery means that it has a good battery and not a malfunctioning battery :)"
What did they do with the battery so it wouldn&#39;t explode?




"Well... Abit out of topic, where do you get that shirt? Haha"
From what app is that wallpaper background?
Please checkout my channel for once.

Samsung Galaxy Grenade review😂
Samsung galaxy note 7 isis edition
You shouldn&#39;t need a pen for the gifs. They just hold it back from the other devices. Shitty move samsung. It&#39;s like making things expensive and then giving a &quot;discount&quot; to make you look good.
How did you set MKBHD logo in left drawer of google play store?
Where do I get that joker t shirt? 😍

I test out GameCube games running on this phone. Thanks for listening
"I really do hope that they solve the smaller battery issue.. I mean, can&#39;t they just make it a bit thicker And not try to be as crazy as Apple is? I really do hope they snap out of the &#39;extremely thin&#39;  game abs realize people actually need bigger battery."

did anyone else notice that like rubber band ball of earpods?
TIL MKBHD wears contacts.
do a comparison of the cameras between iPhone 7 plus and note 7
i love being early
"Hey Marques, you said IP67, but I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s IP68. <br>Have a good day !"

That tshirt is dope 😁
"iP68, little typo there"
"Dear Samsung,<br>We still love u...we know u having a bad time....but we still 💗 u...<br>Your loyal customer 😊"
Waiting for the tesla series lol
Great video!
"sooo this beats the OP 3 or? this one has the snapdragen 820, but €700~800 is a lot tho"
"Yo, MKBHD! I recommend you check out Mt Mographs &quot;Motion 2&quot; script to smooth out some of your AE animations 😉"
nice t-shirt bro😉
find cover
"Ip68, not 67!"
"dayum, that is an early review. This phone just came 2 days ago and nobody has reviewed it yet too. good work mkbhd!"


where can i get MKBHD shirt?
more like grenade review 😂

Had to dislike because you said &quot;jif&quot; --

"seriously... after the booming phones, you are still doing the review… don&#39;t forget to get a good insurance"

seriously is that a bunch of apples earphones...
Great vid 🙂
been waiting for this.
"Nice review but.... Upgrading from the S7 edge to the Note 7 has more benefits than just a S pen. <br><br>1. Touch ID has definately been improved<br>2. The Iris scanner is very useful for wet or gloved hands and its hell fast once it get used wth your eye. <br>3. The S pen of course <br>4. The display is definately brighter and the HDR is noticeable <br>5. I have the dual sim so a 64gig HD is very useful <br>6. It is a much better feel in the hand and its best looking mobile in a market. <br>7. The USB Type C and multiple benefits <br>8. The upgraded software and battery saving improvements are very useful <br>9. Change over now and you get a good resell value on your s7 edge <br>10. The larger screen is always appreciated even if its only minor. <br>11. Finger print scanner is cool.<br>In s7 edge you need to light up screen then you have to use finger print, but in Note 7 you just have to click the home key , finger print recognize right away !<br>And it&#39;s fast i love my note 7.<br><br>Thank you,  hope this helps."
I received the notification after watching the video.
Where can I get the Shirt?

What are the chances of new N7 exploding? 😂💔
Does this device become over heated during charging? @Marques brownlee

Isn&#39;t note 7 ip68 ?
The new models don&#39;t explode so...why are people still acting like they do? The iPhone didn&#39;t receive this kind of criticism lol
Early AF
Which camera wins ? note7 or i7plus?
Did you just say &quot;jif&quot;?
I still say there was some alleged  industrial sabotage over the old phone. Jealous 🍎?
Very very late review
expierencing some lag every now and then on my end too.
I thought it was IP68? and of course iphone users making salty comments. I&#39;m already laughing watching people juggle 2 separate adapters just to charge their phones and listen to music 😂😂
Isn&#39;t it IP68? The iPhone 7 is the IP67.




















































































i dont like the fact that at 1 point. phones will b hable to b held the same.  all screen n nowher to actually hold it.  so yes i dont like the curved display. i like the 3d viewing from htc from a few years back.  why didnt any1 else go that route


can you guys like this so i can be in top comments? :D
yo i got a new note 7 from Samsung through their exchange program but mine doesn&#39;t have the green battery on the always on display. not sure if its just a Canadian thing but just thought you would wanna know for accuracy sake.


"you should make a &quot;budget phones of 2016&quot; video, between $100 to $500"

"Really appreciate how mkbhd always addresses the advantages and disadvantages separately. Not like people who just says that it&#39;s crappy just because of the explosions.<br>Google Pixel is still better, though."
"when using phones to listen to music or watch videos most people uses headphones or earphones like i do so the speaker good or no, it don&#39;t bother me"

I got my replacement exynos version and battery life is much better.. getting around 5-6 hours screen on time vs 3 before.
Im surprised it didn&#39;t explode during the review
Such a consistent high quality YouTuber. Big thank you Marques!
"If only if had dual speakers, stock Android and a wooden back."

"It&#39;s 2016 and still Samsung Phones lags, no hope for Samsung."
Marques just said JIF... I&#39;m unsubscribing
Marques how can you say &quot;gif&quot; as &#39;jiff&quot;<br> :(
When you realise that phone has been Marquees&#39; daily driver😮😂😂
Does it come with a fire extinguisher?















DID YOU SAY &quot;JIF&quot;?!
FACT: Time flies when we watch mkbhd video! :)

I should be sleeping. I have a flight later today and yet I&#39;m on Youtube watching a review of a phone I don&#39;t have anymore...
Things I&#39;ve learned. Holt is scared of speaking. Trump is smart because he doesn&#39;t pay taxes. Clinton didn&#39;t need a sip of water all night
Up late for 6min early crispyness
WU UH I&#39;m climbing up the WU UH
Ahhh just bought a phone recently and a week later this was released lol<br>It looks so good<br>😭 <br>Might get it sometime later on hopefully
hi
"Its gif, not jif"











y so late review
"The thing I like about the Note 7 is that you can use it with gloves on, you can unlock it with your eyes and use the S Pen instead of your finger so if it&#39;s really cold outside and you want to keep your gloves on, you can still use the phone."
I guess you could say that this is a very firey review
I love everything about it but never won any giveaway
"damn I&#39;m early, in the morning."
What took u soo long to make a review for note 7? (I smell favoritism here😅😅). Nice review.
Those S whistles hurt my ears
Dope T-shirt Marques 👍

Terrorists will love this phone.

"as it turns out, underwater is the only safe place to use the note 7."
It&#39;s time for 🔥
Is there any difference in variety of games than the note 5? Or the same?

hurry marques go plant the phone at B
It didn&#39;t explode
"Honestly the nutshack isnt that bad in my opinion, just some of the voice acting is iffy and some visuals/jokes are kinda hard to listen/look at but, its not as bad as some say it was. that said, i think if they toned down on the nasty jokes a bit and payed a little more attention to the voice acting, the nutshack may have stayed around for more seasons. The people working on the nutshack had a lot of fun on the show which is nice."
Do MKBHD reply to comments
