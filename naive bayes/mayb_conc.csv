Maybelline is a tried and tested brand. Love this concealer. Easy to use and apply. Make sure you choose the right color for your skin tone. I use a brush to apply. I have combination, sensitive skin and have no issues with it. Highly recommend.
I use these on all of my clients perfect Matte finish paired withe the loose setting powder, and fit me matte pressed powders , and ofc the foundation
Great value and it works fine.
i can never find this shade in stores and decided to order it online, i actually got 2! i love these
I love this concealer! It blends well, isn’t heavy, and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin or make me stuffy. Will definitely buy again, the price is a plus too!
It has light to medium coverage at most and I find that it oxidizes. It is easy to blend.
I’ve used it for years but usually purchase at CVS or grocery store. This was much cheaper than stores. I hv darkness under my eyes. This provides perfect coverage and moisture. I also use it as base for my eye lids and upper eyes.
My favorite concealer! Works great under the eyes or concealing blemishes
Easy to use. Blends really well. Doesn’t feel cheap. For everyday non-cakey coverage.
Works best for me
I like the way that it easily applies to your face and blends in as you do the coverage to your face,
I liked the moisturizing effect and how it covers.
I’m a little annoyed with this product. I’ve used this concealer for years - it’s a great product. However, I ordered the color associated with shade 10 because I’ve always used shade 10. If you look at the advertised picture of shade 10 it shows 10 “light”, but the REAL shade 10 is “fair”. I didn’t realize this until I received the product. I ordered shade 10 “light” but what I received is shade 15 “light”. Maybe this is partially my fault - I should have went by the shade name instead of the shade number, but I assumed ordering by the shade number would bring me the accurate product. I can and will reorder the right color, just be aware of the flip flop of these 2 shades when ordering this product.
This is not great for dark spots. I had to reapply a few times to get light coverage. But it does go on smooth and blends well.
I was scared of the shade match but it matched me perfectly (I'm between  shades11-13, depending on the weather, for sephora collection concealers). The coverage and finish is great. It covers my dark circles and blemishes well. It lasts all day too
very light weight in the skin blends in really easily and looks amazing
This is so beautiful foundation because after wear it’s looks like very natural .
Isn't drying or patchy. Applies and dries down really nicely, and doesn't turn orange. Will be buying again
Best cheap concealer that I have found! The colors go a little lighter than expected for me.
Nice product. Matches my complexion and does the job for the price
I’ll look for a more full coverage one but it matches me perfectly, I use Maybelline foundation in 336.
Easy to use and a good choice of colors.
It’s a great product except it arrived with the top completely shattered.
I apply concealer under my eyes every single day. I can't justify buying high end so often, so I was so glad to find this a few years ago. It blends wonderfully, non drying, and easy to find at any drugstore (now I buy off Amazon!) Give it a try!
This is my favorite concealer! So lightweight and easy to blend! It does not easily crease and it will take me months before I need another because a little goes a long way with this product! Does not give the heavy, greasy feel on my skin.
Works great don’t even need foundation anymore.
Price was good. Plan to purchase again
it’s pretty good
This is a pretty good concealer but it isn't going to be mistaken for a high end product if you look closely.  The concealer works best if you have moisturized skin, primer on and no wrinkles.  If you put in on dry skin, or on crows feet, it will bring attention to them, not hide them.I use this under my eyes with lots of primer base and it lasts a good 8 hours.  I also use this on some redness or blemishes and it works fine.  For the price, I'd say that this is #2 to my #1 Elf's Camo Concealer.  Still, a good item to have in your workplace makeup bag for quick spot retouches.
Usually when I get concealer, it never works out. Either it doesn't blend, it looks bad and dry or it's just not my shade/color. This one was pretty good, I general bought it because I couldn't find any that fit me, and I was going to use it for SFX things if it didn't work. I now use it for my everyday makeup ♡
If I were to apply only one beauty product before leaving the house, it would be concealer.  My undereyes and my eyelids are so prone to dark shadowy-ness that I swear it looks like I have a penchant for punching myself in the face as part of my morning routine.  If I want to run down the street in the morning to grab a coffee, I either need to put on concealer or wear sunglasses, or I fear that small children will run away from me, screaming in terror, convinced that they just saw a real life zombie coming out of their local Starbucks.As a result of my unrelenting dark circles, concealer and I have a very intimate relationship.  I swear that I have tried EVERY concealer and eye brightener that any magazine, beauty blog, or friend has ever recommended.  YSL Touche Eclat, Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage, Lancome Effacernes, Benefit Boi-ing, Smashbox Photo Op, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, Tarte....okay, I'm going to stop naming concealers I've tried because this is actually getting really depressing and kind of shameful.  The point is, out of ALL of the concealers I've tried, this Maybelline one is my favorite.I realize that my dedication to this concealer, out of all the concealers in the world, is kind of weird and random, but I freaking love this product and I've been using it for years now.  Actually, I take that back.  I kind of hate this product - I would love to not be shackled to my drug-addict-like attachment to concealer.  And no, it doesn't work miracles, my eye circles are still the bane of my facial existence.  (Yes, I know, my life is SO hard.)  But regardless, this concealer is the best one I've got.Sometimes I'll get curious and try something else, but I always come back to this.  It's not too sheer but not too thick, it's not sticky, and it doesn't crease (especially not if I set it with a tiny bit of Make Up For Ever HD Microfinish Powder).  This concealer comes in many different shades (sometimes I go lighter or darker based on the time of year, or mix a pink-based hue with a yellow-based hue.)  It lasts a really long time, it's inexpensive (especially if you buy it online), and it doesn't irritate my usually-sensitive skin.The wand applicator is great.  I've found that most concealers that have a similar consistency to this one are packaged so that you have to click a button or knob on a pen-like contraption in order to dispense more of the product, and then oftentimes too much concealer blobs out at once and you end up wasting it (which is especially annoying when you are dealing with a very expensive concealer).Several of my friends have started using this concealer based on my rave reviews (and this is probably also a good indication that my dark circles do in fact look far less horrifying once I have applied this product).
Maybelline has good quality products.
It looks very natural and the  price is  reasonable.
This is a pretty creamy, moist concealer. I like it quite a bit. It's supposed to be a good dupe for Nars Radiant Creamy, but that's out of my budget so I can only go by rumors. It may be a bit creasy if you have a lot of undereye lines.The image attached shows a dot of Maybelline foundation, Dream Urban Cover in the shade 115 Ivory. It is surrounded by five dots of different Maybelline concealers (five shades from four different lines).SS is Super Stay in 10 Fair. It's a little darker/ashier than Fit Me and Instant Age Rewind in Fair. I'll probably be testing 05 Ivory next.MC is Master Conceal in 10 Fair. It's considerably lighter/brighter than Fit Me and Instant Age Rewind in Fair. I'll probably be trying 20 Light next.Both FM's are Fit Me; FM-F is Fit Me in 10 Fair and FM-L is Fit Me in 15 Light. The former is a pretty good match for Instant Age Rewind in Fair, and the latter is pretty close to the 115 Ivory foundation (they were even closer afer dry-down). For other 115 foundation folks out there, Fair is good for undereyes and Light is good for blemishes.Side note: the shade numbers on Fit Me Fair and Light were flipped at the initial release and possibly in some countries now (they used to be 10 Light and 15 Fair). Fair is lighter than Light, so it now has a lower shade number (as is the standard for Maybelline). Keep that in mind when perusing swatches online. Sometimes 10 and 15 are switched, but Fair is always paler and cooler than Light.IAR is Instant Age Rewind in 110 Fair. It was still a little wet and heaped up at the time of the photo but dried down to be a pretty good match to the Fit Me Fair.Hope this is helpful to any other pale-skinned folks shopping for shades online.
Do not miss this
Appears to be a little thick and takes a bit to spread.  Coverage is great
This stuff is pretty weak. Also, there is very little product in this tube. I couldnt believe how quickly I ran out. This stuff works best if it goes on skin first. This may be weird, but I prefer to put my concealer/brightener on last (but before finish powder). I have no problem with the other brand I had been using (the one that you twist tube and it has a sponge on top. I intend to go back to using that one. The only plus side to this product for me was that the brush allowed me to put product in "tighter" places (like the corners of the eyes). I also did not care for the thickness of this product.
This concealer spreads easily and does not dry out the skin.  It is a bargain!
Right coverage
Really live it for under my eyes to brighten it up (:
Excelente producto
This product works very well for its price. I have struggled with under-eye bags for all of my life, and I decided to buy concealer to hide them a bit. I find that sometimes it takes two coats to fully cover up a blemish or eye bags, but one coat will usually do the trick. Very satisfied with my purchase!
It works great, but there's just not really a lot of it.  I can see me maybe only getting to use this at most 6 times before it's all used up.  This is however great for covering a quick blemish that comes up while out and about.
I ordered wrong color, returned
My wife has been using this a few weeks and loves it.  It goes on well and provides good coverage.  It isn't too thin and you can do multiple layers.  It blends well and the color matches her skin.  It covers well and stays on for the entire day.  It is available at a good price as well.  If she is happy then I am happy.  She looks gorgeous with and without makeup.
I got the light shade and it’s darker than expected. It doesn’t cover very well. Ok for the price.
This is what I use for a natural look. It goes on smooth and covers my dark under eye well. It also sets really well.
Report abuse
It's nothing special; not bad but not great either. Doesn't last very long, but for the price point it's ok.
good
Very light cover.
always a good affordable, medium to full coverage and not too drying or oily
Use all over face as a baseUse various powders and blushNever disappoints
This is my go-to concealer because it’s very cheap and overall okay. It gets the job done and covers up well. The first time I bought it, I’m not sure why but it would always be burning my face and I still could never figure out why. It would be stinging and hurting me a lot. I ordered this again recently and it doesn’t burn or sting my face anymore. Maybe the first product I got was expired or just had the wrong chemicals. Not sure why. But buyers should be careful. I think overall it blends nicely in and covers up my dark circles well but it can make my under eyes look grey which might be because of how dull certain areas of my face just are. The concealer itself I wish it had more product but I rarely ever wear makeup so it lasted for like two years or so. It’s small and carry-able. The color goes well with my face and it makes me look younger and less tired. It really brightens my look up.
Love this product. It covers everything it needs to
This concealer dries in to your skin and doesn’t leave an oily residue. This means your mascara won’t smear the first time you blink. I use it on top of my foundation and love the way it blends. Although I wish the cover up lasted a little longer I am a huge fan!
Used it couple times, seems a bit cakey.
it was so good it very moisturizing to the skin
Cover great
Put some on the right and a little goes a long way it is super cheap and stays on all day especially with it’s my fit me translucent powder !!
Not terrible. small tube. But it’s more pink than I expected. Works to cover dark circles to an extent.
Goes on smoothly and match’s some what but it works not to shabby
I used to purchase Nars concealer in shade Chantilly until I discovered this Maybelline dupe. I have a very sensitive and acne prone skin, but I checked all the ingredients on multiple websites prior to buying it, and they are all clean. It is a non-comedogenic, light and moisturizing concealer with sheer coverage. It's honestly amazing for the price, and I love it. Looks very natural on the skin
Nice but it does not look smooth on skin.
Covers problem areas well but the formula is a bit tacky and doesn't seem to blend well.
It's good enough for the price point.
I don’t review often but this came earlier than expected! I also received an extra one! Thank you so much I am so surprised at how much the color perfectly matched my skin. I bought the Honey shade :)
The color I got was a little too dark for me- I like a white under-eye concealer. But it works great and looks very natural. Definitely needs a setting powder to avoid creasing- but overall works great and covers blemishes as well
This concealer is very nice. It's lightweight, medium coverage and lasts well. However... I'm not entirely convinced that it's authentic. The silkscreening on the 2 I purchased was not exactly the same and the weight of the plastic used is sus.I don't actually mind considering cost and for the fact that it's overall a nice product. Just something to keep in mind.
this concealer is really good and cheap only bad thing is it’s very little product but other than that i like this concealer a lot and i recommended
I love this product I use it everyday it’s good
I love this concealer. It matches my complexion, it's conceals perfectly, and it blends well. It just doesn't last that long. If I put it on in the morning about 9am, it wears off by lunchtime. About 12pm.
I like this as a back up only to nyx
It’s for people who aren’t trying to cover much, so you’d probably have to apply a lot more if youre trying to cover dark circles! Also consider the fact that the tube is small! But the color is great and with some setting powder you’ll be okay! Lol
I have oily combo skin. My dark circles aren’t bad but they are discolored since I don’t get as much sleep as I need. This concealer works great on top of a silicone based primer (I use Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen as a primer/sunscreen). I made the mistake of applying this concealer on top of my skin without primer & it was not compatible with my skin type (it started dragging and not blending well & sinking into my fine lines). So if you have similar skin type as I do, use a primer! I just put a dot or two under my eyes & blend with a concealer brush & it’s great!
nice if your not looking for high coverage
it’s very cool and is nice
I got this to brighten up under my eyes, but found I could also dab a little on two imperfections on one of my cheeks and temple.  Age spots I guess. I don't apply all over the face foundation unless I am going out in the evening, but when I did the imperfections were covered even better by using this under it. It's light and creamy and easy to spread and blend.  No flaking. Does not dry out the skin. (I have dry skin) This is perfect for a gentle concealer when you don't want to apply foundation, and even better if you use it under your foundation.
Most likely will not use as much
Great coverage! I haven’t worn it outside for a full day yet but I’m excited to see how long it lasts. It goes on softly and I only need a little for great enough coverage for my dark under eyes. I like this a lot more than what I was using previously.
I loved the fit me foundation so I wanted to try this, and omg It’s perfect. Really light and easy to blend. Soft and there was 2 that came in. Definitely worth it!
super good really like
Great concealer. Works well
Gives great coverage
I wasn't married to any specific brand for anything specific so tried BoxyCharm subscription box to try new things. I love their service and their makeup was good but even after trying so many expensive brands, I wasn't sold on a concealer.After doing too much research I quit and ordered a cheap one from Amazon until I made up my mind on which to order. Welp, my journey stops here. For the price there isn't a ton of liquid in container so order many or save to order more later. This stuff is amazing. It looks completely natural and blends my dark spots better than anything. Def order.
A friend recommended me this product as a drug store brand with high end results. I'm so glad I tried it. It's such an affordable price and covers my blemishes so easily.
good for beginners ! 💋
The concealer itself is fine. However, it lasted me less than a month. There’s practically no product. At least it was cheap.
I’ve bought the same item before a few months ago and if I remember correctly it did have a seal and wasn’t opened. This one was and makes me feel hesitant to use on my skin/face
i would say this a light to medium coverage but it's light and it doesn't crease under my eyes
Been using this along with the fit me pressed powder for about 5+ years now and they are my absolute favorite! Also arrived super quick and in good packaging.
It's difficult to but makeup online without knowing how the color actually looks. It's inexpensive so it's with the risk. I bought one that was too dark based upon the recommended number paired with my concealer. So I bought another one and it was too light. It was my fault because the shade I needed wouldn't be delivered in time. Either way, I still use them. They work great and get the job done.
I use it everyday
I bought this because I wanted something to cover undereye circles that also had SPF. I used to use Neutrogena's formula that was specifically made for this issue and it worked great, but something is off about their colors is off now. This product didn't cover much of anything, and stung my eyes to boot. Not impressed.
Great product with good coverage but not too heavy. I wouldn’t say it is very sheer or moisturizing but it works great to cover problem areas or dark spots and as a highlighter.
Decent concealer! I do have to use two layers of it but it’s fine enough!
Many more colors are actually available from the manufacturer than you can order here. No color chart. Had to buy 3 and mix them to get a good color. Stays on well though. Worth the $3
I was never one to need to wear makeup but now that im older there are just a few pigmentation spots that could be balanced out making it blend into my natural skin color and boy is this the answer. I also wear glasses and have the annoying marks on the bridge of my nose so when i switch to my contacts i like to conceal those darker marks too. I am very pleased with my purchase.
Great price. Cheaper than in stores
Use this daily to hide my dark circles
I put it on and forget about having anything on my face.  Great product.
I’ve used this many times before I don’t know if they changed the consistency but it burned my under eyes
This is a very nice match in the Fit me line. It is very creamy and smooth. I was very pleased with my purchase if this and will deff be buying this again in the future. If you buy the same number as the foundation, it matches perfectly. And if you go a slight shade lighter, it is beautiful for a enhancer for the eye area.I have been using the Maybelline brand for at least the past 8-9 years and I don't plan on switching. Fingers crossed that they don't make and changes on their end. But the Fit me matte it perfect if your face is a bit on the oily side. And I have an issue with that by the end of the day. And this foundation is excellent at controlling that. If you use a really good moisturizer to set your face off and allow it to dry to tacky and then add a very good primer on top of that. And let that set to "bake" a bit. As you hunt for something to wear. And then apply your foundation. And then whatever eyeshadows, mascaras, liners, brows, etc.  you are going to wear. And then use a good primer to set all of it. You will be good for the day. Sure you could use whatever foundation and set it with a primer. But it all plays hand in hand. If one is bad, then it knocks it all out of whack. You have to use a good base and set it right. And this foundation gives you a very good base.
It did well.
As described.  Works well under eyes to brighten those dark bags.
I ordered one and I received two like an amazing deal Bess under eye cover up I have purchased
This is my everyday use to go choice. I love this product so much. Good price and coverage. Can’t complain
BUY THIS! As a 36 year old mom of two, I am always tired af and trying to hide it...THIS IS IT! Just as good as the $20 I was spending in Sephora/Ulta but a fraction of the cost and shipped to my house.

The coverage for this concealer is AMAZING! I was blown away at how well it covered my hereditary dark circles. I love makeup, but for a quick day to day I just stick with concealer to brighten up my under eye. I usually buy more expensive brands for good coverage but I'm allergic to the fragrance in them and I kept hearing great things about the FitMe concealer. I really can't say enough about how impressed I was with it and it's a fraction of the price. And the best part is that my eyes don't get itchy at the end of the day because there is no fragrance. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because of how hard it is to color match for me. I am fairly pale but I have yellow undertones, so I ordered "15 Light" because the others look too pink but it's a little too dark to wear as concealer. Would be a great overall color but it won't brighten under my eyes as much and so it just doesn't work. Luckily, they offered me a refund. I will go into a store and ask for a recommendation before I buy another color but definitely plan to buy FitMe concealer again if I can color match it well.

This is absolutely perfect. I really wasn't expecting it to be so great since it's not that expensive, and I tried the Fit Me foundation and hated it.But this concealer has really great coverage and feels so light. It hasn't made me break out at all and doesn't settle into pores or fine lines, though you can easily use a primer with it if you want for more assurance. I use this for blemishes, redness, and dark circles.Let me tell you something about my dark circles for a second. They're absolutely terrible, and no amount of makeup has ever been able to make them go away or be reduced by much. I fell deeply in love with this concealer because the lighter tones don't tend to have worse/sheerer coverage, which is a trend I notice with other concealers. It stays opaque and all you have to do is lightly pat it around the horrible gray/purple/ohgodwhyme colored area with your ring fingers. It doesn't look unnaturally heavy and it stays really well, especially if set with some kind of powder.The only very tiny problem with it is that the tube makes the concealer look very slightly darker than it really is, but it's really not a huge deal or something you can avoid with any brand. I would say it's quite true to color.The packaging is kind of neat, I think. It's very minimalist and chic, and you can very easily travel with it since the lid is actually quite tight and the tube is pretty durable. Don't let its thin design fool you; there's quite a lot of product in this, not to mention the great pigmentation means you don't have to use so much in the first place.I'm so excited over this that I wish I could give it more than five stars. Maybelline, as many problems as we've had over the years, you have made the only drugstore concealer that is any good for all purposes and is definitely worth the money. I think I'll have to buy enough backups to last for the next few decades. Talk about a hidden gem.
I ordered a 10 fair and it looked paler but besides that it was great!
Not as full coverage as one would expect with a concealer however, you get what you pay for.
Works great, easy to apply, lasts throughout the day, and it feels good on.
I really like this concealer. I use it beneath my eyes and to brighten up my veiny purple lids. It’s hard to find concealers pale enough to match my complexion, and usually they’re too yellow, so I’m very pleased with this shade.  A little bit goes a long way- I dab a few dots where I need it and then blend with a makeup sponge.
This concealer is amazing and I like it even better then high end ones, and this is a fraction of the price!

I bought this dreaming of getting expensive, department store results at a bargain price and you know what? This product accomplished that! It's nice and opaque, conceals and brightens the shadows under my eyes, while not being heavy, cakey, or chalky. It's nice and creamy, moisterizing, feels light on my skin, and a little goes a long way. Love this product. I've finally found the perfect concealer!
For years, my HG concealer has been Laura Mercier's Secret Concealer. But I wanted something for days when I wear just very light makeup, and turned to this after hearing lots of positive reviews on the Internet and also the Nars Creamy Concealer (which many people say the Maybelline is a dupe for).After having used this and the Nars a few times, I have to say that the Nars provides better coverage and blends a little better. However, for the price, the Maybelline concealer really is a star. It's got a lovely texture (not too thick, not too liquidy) and does blend well with either your fingers or a Beauty Blender, though it doesn't disappear completely into the skin. Still, it looks pretty flawless and works very well on light makeup days. I have very dark circles, so this doesn't cover them up completely (but then again, no concealer does, unless I use it with a color corrector).I am about an NC25-30 (depending on how tan I am), and I got this concealer in Light 10. When it arrived, I was worried it would be too light. But it looks wonderful once it's blended in - you can't see any lines (where the concealer starts and ends) and my under-eye area looks very natural, just slightly brightened, which is a great effect. I am thinking of repurchasing it when I run out.***edited to add the following***After using this for quite a number of weeks, I have to say that I think it's even better than Nars Creamy Concealer. The Nars has a tendency to settle into fine lines and look a little cakey after a few hours, but the Maybelline stays pristine and undetectable! Very impressed! Am definitely going to repurchase.
Bought maybelline fit me in shade 10 first and then 15. I have a light (maybe, even fair) skin with red/cool undertones and for me, 10 is a bit too light but 15 is perfect. It is spread easily with fingers or concealer brush and holds on perfectly for full 8 hours at least. I do not have darkness or puffiness under eyes, just a little dark on the inner corner of the eye and this product does a very good job on me. I use it also to conceal my pimples on the chin and overall, I am very happy with this product, especially, after paying twice for tarte concealer, highly claimed and praised one, which cannot be even compared to this product; so after wasting money on tarte concealer, decided to write the review for maybelline, maybe someone will not repeat my mistake!

Worked perfect for what I needed it too
It's my favorite! Brightens eyes, good coverage.
It’s ok for a regular day wear but it is not full coverage. On the first picture I only add the concealer and you still clearly see my dark under eyes. On the second one has a little orange color corrector, foundation, and on top the concealer. It did help but I wish it could have done a better miracle because you can see some darkness. I’m only 20 but since I was just a child I’ve had eye bags and dark under eyes. No concealer has ever really helped but it’s worth trying as many as a can.  If your eyes are not that dark this is a decent product.
Goes on great! No cakey or streaks. Great high light!!
Great cover … I use it everyday
The concealer is too thin and sheer. Very little coverage.
This item us pricey for such sheer coverage.  Tube design is not good.
Matched my skin tone perfectly!
It doesn't stay on though, I go out and my face starts looking like I'm shedding, dry flaky spots. I love how easy it is to use and it doesn't bother my awful acne like other cover ups have. The shade matched perfect with my really pale skin, worth a shot 😊
It's alright for the price, but I thought it would be more brightening. It spreads well but for some reason it makes my undereye look gray like when you don't use color correction on dark circles and put concealer over it, but I don't have an issue with that normally. It's good for spot treatment, not great for under eye brightness.
Like the item
Product was very good but the color was too dark.
I like that it is very easy to apply.  However, It does not work as well as other concealers.  Does not seem to cover up discolorations, etc.  Would not buy it again.
I'm normally skeptical of products I buy on Amazon, but this seems to be the real deal! And if not, it does a great job acting like it. The color online was true to the color I received, and it has pretty good coverage!
Works as good as my 35 dollar concealer for a fraction of the price. Got rid of my circles and made my eyes look fresh, best Maybelline product I've ever tried ( and I'm not normally a fan)
Good
First time trying this whole new makeup techniques using all the different products. I'm dark brown and I did a good job blendingWill recommend
This concealer covers up the red veins in my cheeks like magic! And it stays on. I no longer need a foundation. This stuff does the trick!
I like the applicator and smooth moist texture for dark eye circles. Surpasses the $30 concealer by far!!
This is my all-time holy grail of concealers. Just thick enough, long wearing & creamy. Have purchased MANY expensive brands and always  come back to this. Dupe for Nars.
Love it.
My favorite makeup product. I actually use this all over my face like foundation. You don’t need a whole lot, it is full coverage and stays on all day.
Lasts all day
Easy to apply but shows all your creases, burns my face when I put it on as well if you have sensitive skin don’t use
No applicator.  Use anyway for covering blemishes
I typically use high end concealers due to my lifelong struggle with severe hereditary circles. For me, money is basically no object when it comes to concealer  - I just want something that will make me look like I don't have two black eyes! I tried this stuff a couple years back and liked it, but continued to experiment. Several hundred dollars later, and I'm back to Fit Me as my daily concealer. Is it the most opaque coverage? No. But, now that I'm 32 I need something that isn't drying or cakey, and I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of coverage for a more youthful, natural look.  I played around with super emollient concealers like Tarte Maracuja and It Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereye, and I'm not saying I'm going to toss them out, but for every day this stuff wins due to its easy application and blending. The doe foot applicator is a boon on rushed mornings. The formula feels very similar to Nars Radiant, however I find this gives a more natural finish. The Nars tends to dry up and crack on me. I do use a color corrector first due to the severity of my circles (Armani, the orange one) and I set with Laura Mercier Brightening powder and a spritz of Mac Fix +. This combo is working beautifully. I say give it a shot. It's cheap as hell and if you think it sucks just throw it in your purse as a backup.
Easy to apply. Good coverage. Doesn’t crack.
I ordered three shades (25, 30 & 35); two out of the three were opened. I of course am returning the opened/used items and will be refunded. I also called Amazon to make them aware of this. I was asked to leave a review as well, so here it is.Now, it just so happened that the shade (30) that was sealed is a close fit for me; it blended in with my skin nicely and brightened my under eye shadows/circles. I've tried other concealers, but they were either too light or orangey. I do not wear makeup, but I got tired of people (mostly family) saying "you need to get some sleep" when I did get sleep.  😒I doubt I'll order makeup from Amazon again, but I do like this concealer.
a staple in my makeup bag. Was cheaper on here than in stores.
Easy to apply, very moisturizing with great coverage!
does not have much coverage
I received two of these in a package together for a nominal charge.  The results on my face are outstanding & plan on ordering again.  I highly recommend!!
Every few years I find a makeup product that works perfectly and is affordable.  Then the inevitably discontinue it!  I just found this, after looking for a few years for a new concealer with more coverage.  I am 32, fair, with freckles in summer, dark circles all year long, and newly developing fine lines around my eyes.  I used to use covergirl concealer with a blue wand top.  That still is the only other concealer that doesn't settle and make my lines look worse, but the coverage isn't strong enough now with darker circles.  This product is just as creamy and blendable, but gives more coverage.  I have been using it for two weeks and I love it.  I wear contacts and this doesn't bother them or make my eyes watery.  Light (10) is a perfect match for me.  I think I am in the middle between a cool and warm complexion and this color blends easily with my fingers and disappears, but makes my circles disappear as well!  My lines look about the same, or slightly less, than without concealer.  They certainly are not accentuated by this, as they were with the dozens of others I have tried and threw away.  I would pay double or triple for this, but am so happy it is affordable!  The price here seems to be comparable to other places.  I am buying extras now, in case it ever gets discontinued.  By the way, on the rare occasion I get a blemish, this covers that well too.  I am so pleased with this and recommend it to anyone with thin skin, fines lines, and dry skin who normally experiences the caking or settling of concealer around the eyes!
this is literally the only concealer that matches my skin color perfectly 😭😭😭❤️❤️
Whenever I use this concealer my skin gets redder than it already was and starts to burn. I have a lot of other stuff from this brand and have never had a problem though.
its nice and does the job, but i takes me like three layers, and smells like sunscreen. But for the price its rlly not bad i just needed foundation desperately since i ran out 💀(sorry for the grainy photo idk what happened to my phone)
This works great. The coverage is good and it's not dry..or shiney. Love it
Goes on very blotchy. It’s hard to blend. It doesn’t cover my black circles around my eyes either. I’m just glad I didn’t pay much for it.
I love this way more than I expected to! A must have to your makeup arsenal!
Nice product, no issues. Sits well with cream foundations. Sits nicely with primer
Mine came dried up with barely any in the container. Pretty disappointed as thought found a convenient way to buy this product through prime. I think maybe that’s why it contributed to turning out looking cakey and setting into the fine lines underneath my eyes..
This has always been my go to concealer and I’m so disappointed I haven’t bought it off Amazon before! My local stores sell it for over $6 for one so getting it for a little over $3 is a steal!
I ordered 40 caramel because the shades 45 and 30 both oxidize to a deeper red undertone. My skin is more on the golden side. If you are looking for a golden undertone concealer try fawn from the l.a girl pro concealer. All of these seem to oxidize and turn red. However, I have no complains for the formula.
So I originally purchased this for an under eye concealer to replace the one I had just bought that ended up being the wrong color.  This one was definitely better.  You can use this as your primary concealer, or your under eye.  I am not highly impressed, but I am also not disappointed.  It works for it's intended use, so I am happy.  I wish they gave more product in the tube.  I apply it with the included applicator wand, and then blend it out with a brush or beauty sponge.  It does tend to make the skin feel a little oily.  Removal is super easy as well.  Overall, it is a good product.  I actually purchased this in another shade right after using it once so I could use it as my primary concealer, and my under eye.  One con, the company needs to offer this is a bigger variety of shades.
Time consuming to assemble but worthwhile
The product looks good in the morning but by lunchtime it is dull and clumping under the eye. A couple times people asked if my eye was swollen too. I would try a different color to see if it just was the light one I have but only because it doesn’t cost much. Short term okay. Not an all day product.
I’ve worn this concealer for a while and the one from Amazon seemed older and a little dried up which caused it not to spread as well and to feel clumpy.
Sadly this didn’t conceal anything.
Drawing
This is good for eye makeup but I concealed my under eye, chin, nose, and forehead for highlighting and it’s pretty good and long lasting concealer.
love how easy it is to glide and apply the product, it’s almost like lotion. my only problem is that it’s not high coverage and blends away too quickly. you would need to layer it to get a higher coverage.
Easy to apply and blend into skin tone. Covered dark circles under my eyes so well. Very satisfied
This had been my go to everyday concealer for years. It does not crease, covers well and looks great!
I have purchased this product numerous times in the past and its my go to concealer. The only issue I have is that It leaks on the side where you put the cap on sometimes. But what do you expect, the product works well for everyday use at a good price.
Amazing for the price. I have purchased expensive ones and did not like them as well as I do this one.
Best concealer, so smooth and doesn’t crease. Blends easy and has variety of shades.
Good
Love that its always the same quality and colour
It gets the job done. Not the best or the worst. I typically use this for under eye and for contouring my nose and face. It could probably have more staying power. I use setting spray religiously and this still seems to not give the best conceal. Less water, more product please.
I wear for lupus “butterfly” rash. I was skeptical at first, due to cost, but it works to help with that red warm area that’s called butterfly ( bridge of nose and along the nostrils out to Cheka, looks like a butterfly)  it’s been hard finding a product to cover it. Mary Kay, until they discontinued.Overall covers the area well with drying time descent too. Enough time to spread it without drying too fast. I went down a shade of my skin tone. Not recommended as a base for entire face.  But great for spots needing  cover up before foundation applied.
A Lil on the watery side.... but still a good priced good product!
I used under my eye as a concealer, it was pliable but shade was off , too light
This doesn't conceal the dark under the eye. It's also too light for my complexion
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
I really like the concealer.. It's affordable, lightweight and covers dark circles well.
It’s such a good match to my skin and doesn’t break my sensitive skin out
I have really dark circles. I was born with them and they just keep getting worse as I age. I must have tried a thousand concealers over the years. Probably many more than that but I dare not think about all the money I spent! I ordered Fit Me in Light after seeing a YouTube video and how well it covered the woman's dark circles who was demonstrating it. I got light although my skin is medium. I always go one shade lighter with concealer because it has a big job to do covering brown circles like mine. This concealer comes in a convenient tube with a sponge applicator. It is creamy and the color is about what I expected.It isn't thick but not runny either. I usually use a peachy colored primer then apply concealer. I did this and my eye area looked great. BUT...within an hour, my dark circles were back. Not completely but they were in need of brightening. If only the concealer stayed put for even a few hours I would be happy. I do lightly powder the area but need to be careful or else my aging (I am almost 50) eyes will looked creased and worse than before.I like this concealer but it just doesn't have the staying power I need. Not many do so it isn't just THIS one that wears off. I have a couple that I like but even the high end ones wear off in a few hours. Hassle. This concealer would be fine for anyone  who wants to conceal mild circles, marks and blemishes but, if you need something to camouflage dark circles or other tough spots and you need it to last, I don't think you will be completely satisfied with this one. I touch up throughout the day with an eye brightener but for once I would like to go out and feel confident that the way I looked when I left is the way I will look two or three hours later. I am going 3 stars. The search continues and probably will continue forever!
I love how this concealer is so creamy and it’s not too thick , but just thick enough .
Great concealer
Purchased for my skin but it’s no good for that so I use to make my eye shadow pigment ed and last longer through out the day. I like my concealer on the thick side.
I was hoping for 100% coverage of the age spots on my face. This will lighten them, but you can still see them... even with 3 layers on. It's ok for lightening dark cicles...but nothing more dramatic than that.
It last all day but it could be a bit dry and creases a bit. Might be good for oily skin. I have combination skin and can make it work.
Product was not sealed properly by the time it got to me. I have requested a refund, which was easy, and should be processed  in a few days.
I like the sheerness
This gave great coverage and blended super easy.
This product is good just that it made me break out so bad, I had clear skin before it and the next day I woke up with a lot of acne, if you have sensitive skin don’t buy this
I was skeptical about this product but I love it for my dark circles under my eyes!Will purchase againVery easy to put on!
I may or may not buy  these concealers waaay too often. Love them
I was hoping that this would be a drugstore replacement for the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer.  It's not.  But it is very cheap compared (the NARS product runs $29 for the same size container).  The color of this compared to the NARS is a little beige-tanner, and the the NARS is a bit more grey.  The Maybelline is thinner and less richly pigmented, which is really the only issue that I have with it.  I have very dark purpley circles around my eyes (have since I was a wee lassy) and concealer has been my only fix.  I dab it around the inside and under my eyes and use a concealer brush to smooth out and blend up onto my upper lid (they're also very purpley).  Since the coverage isn't quite as good as the NARS, I go back over with a tiny bit of the NARS to hide things even better.  If my circles weren't so dark, I would definitely only use the Maybelline.  The Maybelline actually creases far less than the NARS does, so it's a better "base" anyway.  It has reduced the amount of NARS thatI have to use, and I am very happy with this product!
I'm looking to update my makeup look as I mature.  You can't wear the same makeup at 50 you did at 30.  So, I've been trying new things, looking for more flattering formulas for my dry skin.  The Fit Me line is really amazing.  It reminds me of the old Maybelline makeup of my youth.  Light, soft, and moisturizing.  It blends beautifully and covers without being heavy.  I have multiple health problems therefore I have permanent dark circles under my eyes.  This covers them nicely without looking cakey or creasing.  It covers red spots without flaking as well, because now I get to have spots and grey hair.  That's fair, right?  All in you can't beat the price, for the coverage and moisture.  Really impressed with this one.
I have serious dark circles under my eyes with deathly pale skin. Lovely, I know. I also have a box of concealers. White or skintone lipstick types, green powder, yellow cream, etc.  Nothing works and I have a bad habit of not bothering to return them.So........I thought, what's the harm in trying this one, I haven't added to my box of rejects this week, so I bought this.SERIOUSLY A GAME CHANGER!!!!I carefully do a somewhat triangle over my circles and blend down my nose. Then I use the matching foundation. I honestly look human!!! I recommended this to my daughter who has also been on a quest for the perfect concealer. THANK YOU!
I use this on my chin where the skin is a little darker on the sides. Many concealers don't really lighten well but I've been using this for years and still like it. It goes on easily and blends in evenly. Stays on for hours. The sponge tip lets you put it exactly where you need it.
I use this product around my eyes and it works great.  Doesn't burn, has a nice color, and it stays.
I love the fit me concealer. It doesn't look cakey which has been my problem with other concealers. It blends beautifully. I use it as a brightner since I don't need to cover anything. Since I use it as a brightner and I have pale skin with freckles and some red on  my cheeks I use the lightest concealer I can. I had purchased 15 fair from the store bc it was the lightest in stock and its very light and looks great. When I saw them here on Amazon I decided to get the color 10 light. This is why I took one star off, when I pulled the wand out I saw right away that it looked allot darker than 15 fair. I put them both on my arm side by side then blended them out and it was considerably darker which is odd bc it's supposed to be lighter. Keep that in mind if you're pale skinned and looking to purchase this concealer. I absolutely love it and I will continue to use it in the color 15 fair.
I purchased this on a whim for my dark circles and sporadic breakouts.  I've never picked my exact color match even in the store, let alone online, but I did so with this concealer.  I really like the amount of coverage this gives you.  It definitely conceals everything I need it to.  My one complaint is that it doesn't last as long as I'd like.  That being said, I will be ordering this again.  The overall coverage and feel of this fair outweighs the issue of longevity for me.
Kinda smells weird
I love this concealer.  I have a hard time finding concealer that is light enough for my complexion but this was perfect. I use it for full face coverage and it works and looks great. The price was perfect. It was an excellent purchase.
I tend to have oily skin so I thought this produce would work with my skin type. It didn't. It was too dry, hard to apply evenly and didn't last long.
I used to get Mac concealer but I can’t get it on Amazon and it’s a little more expensive. This is exactly like that concealer but cheaper and easier to get
It came a bit darker than i thought. It looked lighter in the picture though. Good coverage.
I'm recovering from a bout of terrible cystic acne. I have dark scars around my jaw and kind of all over my face. You don't have to use much of this to get full coverage, so you don't end up looking like you're caked with makeup. I use a little bit of this to cover the dark spots and in the corner of my eyes, and then use a mixture of their foundation in 110 and 112 with a drop of argon oil with a beauty sponge to blend it all. Seriously and highly recommended. It stays on all day too. (Unedited photo, you can see my scars/texture, but this concealer doesn't make it worse like most).
This this product creases and is rather drying
It’s ok but I’ve tried better concealers as this one appears a little cakey
Matched my skin & wasn't cakey
Best concealer.  In love with it. Doesn’t cake under my eyes and last all day. Perfect match for my skin
I have used this product for years.  It works great as a cover-up for unwanted flaws.
I would rate this 4.5 if possible since it was perfect for what I ended up using it for, but it was not quite right for what I intended it for, that being, covering my dark undereye circles. I read this was a very popular concealer amongst beauty artists so thought I would give it a try.It was not a good color for me to conceal my dark undereye circles, but it largely stays on during the day, albeit it seemed a bit dry looking as the day wore on. Maybe I needed a peachy-er shade.  It seems not be able to counteract the dark bluish tone to undereye circles despite being highly pigmented.It WAS perfect for covering a bruise on my leg, it blended perfectly and did not come off all day. At the end of the day, it stayed on even after a shower, and I had to remove the concealer with rubbing alcohol.  I am not sure if this could fully cover a tattoo, but it probably could cover some tattoos.  The bruise was pretty dark, and this concealer still looked natural on my skin
wide variety of shades and overall a pretty good product especially for the price
For the price this is an excellent product with good coverage for under eye
This one and nyx concealer are the ONLY ones I will use. Light weight but definitely not sheer . Doesn't crease as long as you apply it on one thin layer at a time and allow those layers to dry between applications!! Very efficient and the light shade is super light!!
No matter what I do, this concealer immediately settles into the creases around my eyes, so it's a bust for under eye concealer. However, the formula is so smooth and silky and the coverage is lovely - not at all sheer, and yet not too heavy like a lot of full coverage concealers. Because of that, this has still become a staple in my makeup bag. I use it on my cheeks to cover up discoloration from sun damage, and anywhere else I need extra coverage instead of adding extra layers of foundation. It blends beautifully with my foundation or my bb cream. The shades are darker than expected. I ordered light and it matches my skin tone with a medium summer tan.
The product is heavy and very drying around the eye area. Also, there is very little product in the bottle. You might get 10-15 uses before it’s empty.
I wouldn't use any other concealer besides this brand . Blends beautifully
I love how well this blends with my foundation and it's a quick fix for blemishes!
I use this as my foundation touch ups and it works great it small and convenient to carry anywhere.
im a warm toned brown and this looks like my shade in the picture but in real life it is more orange and doesn't blend into my skintone. its like a fake tan brown instead of real brown skin (i am naturally brown)
this concealer is good with a lil bakin powder but idk if it’s meant for dogs to eat yk like my dog ate it he had to be put down
I really enjoy this concealer for a daily use. It’s not high coverage, but decent.
For me this concealer did not work because it was on the dry side never really set properly and look tacky and dry.
Did what it is supposed to do but not completely. Must use a primer before starting this concealer and foundation combo so it doesn't cake around fine lines wrinkles or larger pores.
mean no objections here it even came with two so I must say this is a must buy.
Dries down fast, unlike the shape tape which is what I normally use. I like that it doesn’t feel heavy or too full coverage. I have to do one area at a time with this one, instead of applying to all the areas and then blending. Also it does oxidize at least on me, I’m very fair and red headed so it turns a little orange.
The tip is small and fine, so you can be focused on applying to the tiny area.lightweight and not greasy, but has good coverage.
This was the first liquid concealer I have purchased (previously didn't use any or got a lipstick-looking cream sort of one as a gift and didn't like it). After reading reviews and figuring out which on would be good quality, but cheaper - since I hadn't used it and didn't know if I'd like it - I came across this one.After having it for a few months now - I love it. I would definitely buy this again. I use it to cover imperfections or to hide dark circles under my eyes as a touch-up after work etc.I was a tad nervous to pick a color online, but the one I ordered worked perfectly. (I'm quite pale and have a slight red undertone and ordered 25 medium.)I have had no discomfort or irritation occur, which is not something I normally have to worry about - I don't have particularly sensitive skin. I am on the oily side, but wearing this had has no ill-effects.I do notice that after a long day sometimes bigger imperfections will end up showing though, but I chalk this up to normal make-up fading that happens as you wear it longer and am experimenting with make-up setting sprays and primers. :) This is easy enough to keep in my purse and dab on touch-ups if I am going somewhere further after work, so I have no real complaints.
The coverage is amazing and blends like a dream!
The black stripe (near the top of the bottle by the applicator) rubbed off onto my hands. At first I had no idea why my left hand had black smudges on it. Turns out its from the container! Just holding it with my left hand while I applied concealer with my right hand somehow melted the paint. Is this a counterfeit product?? It's happening with 2/3 of the concealers I bought.
It’s good to use
Nice
The concealer it’s self was not bad for the price, whoever I immediately broke out in hives all over my face.
Too sheer for decent under-eye coverage unless set with powder (which is not an option for mature eyes, as powder emphasizes fine lines). Even so, the coverage looks patchy instead of "natural." The price definitely reflects the quality. I tossed this concealer after finding another affordable drugstore brand that actually works: Milani Conceal + Perfect.
Love the way this covers, not Cakey. But, it is very thin and there isn't a ton of product.
i really wanted to try this product.easy to use, light coverage but good.
Best under eye cover for a reasonable price.
When this product came in, it had obviously already been opened. Amazon was quick to send me a replacement though! For the price this is a pretty good concealer. I will say that “light” is a little dark, so if you have fair to light skin I recommend getting the lightest shade that they have available. I had this concealer on (over my foundation) for over 8 hours yesterday and even took a nap in it and it held up pretty well. I had a little mascara smudges under my eye but i’m not sure if that is from the concealer or the new setting powder I used. I give it 4 stars because the color isn’t exactly “light”.
It's just "ok" I never used concealer in my life till I hit my late 40s and noticed some duskiness and uneven color under my eyes and around my nose.  Granted this one is very low priced and low tech,  so I didn't expect much and I'm not accustomed to applying it,  so don't put a lot of stock in my assessment,  but i feel like the more I try to blend it with my beauty blender, the more uneven it looks,  so you have to work very quickly and maybe even use some moisturizer over your primer to make it more workable.
I finally found a concealer that matches my skin tone! I was nervous because I was purchasing this concealer off Amazon, not knowing if the color would even match, but I am so glad I took that risk. Definitely purchasing again.
I bought this because the price was unbeatable and I wanted to try it out as a possible wedding product. I know next to nothing about makeup, but I’m in love with this product. It’s a lightweight formula and doesn’t make my skin look cakey and matched my skin tone perfectly while really brightening my under eye. I have super dry skin and this product laid on really well, and almost felt like it added more moisture to my skin. The coverage i would say is medium, as it covered most of my dark spots and blemishes, but then again I only put on the tiniest amount. Overall I’m very impressed with this product.
It is a great low cost product
Good color similarity to the pictures, blends very nicely and stays for 4-9 hours so it definitely is a good concealer
Maybelline Fit Me concealer did what I wanted it to do, cover the circles under my eyes. I didn't pay attention to how well it moisturized and I didn't want it to be sheer. It worked all day and I was happy with it.
Nice product
I'm brunette, fair skin, dark circles under eyes. I keep searching for a concealer that could help with that but this wasn't it. Have bought various shades and it doesn't seem to 'conceal' anything very well or for very long. But it might not be the product, it could just be my skin.Note* I am 54 and the undereye area is also showing slight wrinkles so the concealer does tend to get a little 'cakey' in the creases. Maybe not the best product to be using for my skin type so as my search continues, I can't blame the product if it is all me.3 stars for not concealing other areas it should as stated in it's description.
Overall, I am quite pleased with the product. It is a little lighter than I had expected, but seems to work well. The application is simple and it hides the freckles I want it to hide. A simple applicator brush to get the concealer exactly where you want it!  I don't use the product daily, but have used it frequently and know that it does not cause any skin irritation.  The price point is good.  It's a nice product to have in your cosmetic bag, even if you have flawless skin.  Every now and then, there seems to be something we want to hide even if it is just for a special occasion. Isn't it funny how one tiny thing on your face makes you worry so much? This helps give your security and confidence back!
This is a decent concealer.  I have tried lots of different ones (my current favorite is Ulta's full coverage concealer), but this one is pretty good.  The color was a nice light shade for when I'm not tan during the winter.  It did a decent job of covering under eye circles, but perhaps was a bit underwhelming on a pesky healing blemish (I had to apply a little more and then ultimately applied some of my full-coverage Ulta on top).  All in all, for the price, this is not bad.I should mention that the first time I received the product, it did not come in any kind of cardboard/plastic packaging and, moreover, there was a piece of tape around the seam between the top applicator and rest of the tube, which was a bit disconcerting.  I contacted Amazon and they promptly sent me a replacement, which had an actual company-labeled seam between the two parts of the container.
I recently purchased this concealer after seeing a demonstration on a YouTube video. It looked like it went on very smoothly and covered the dark circles on the model so I went ahead and ordered some for myself. I purchased the Sand color as I was hoping for a good match to my fair/med skin tone. It it a bit more yellow than I thought it would be and I was skeptical before applying it but it actually did a good job of covering up the dark circles under my eyes. It didn't crease, fade or cake on me for the 10 hours I had it on my face and it stayed well despite the heat and humidity. The Fit Me concealer did do the job for much less than the department store brands of concealer I have bought in the past. I like the applicator, the sponge tip made it easy to put the concealer where I needed it. It blended easily with my fingertips and it stayed put so I have to say I am pleased with my purchase.
I bought the same concealer a couple months ago in a drugstore and it was the same color(15) but when I ordered this one the color was way darker :(
I guess this concealer is not the same they sell at retail stores. It wasnt what I expected and seem like not very good quality.
its super dry
Gives good coverage, but doesn’t have the best shade range. Don’t really like the small, thin applicator either.
First off, I should say this concealer is amazing. It is thick enough to cover blemishes without being patchy or clinging weirdly and it lasts all day.It doesn't look heavy or oxidize, and it covers my spots enough that I can wear it without foundation.Unfortunately the shade the shade range is confusing and unimpressive. I am on the fairer side, and the shade 15 fair only matches the areas of my faces with more pigmentation, like my cheeks and nose. I would never be able to use this under my eyes because its too dark. It doesn't seem like the shades go very dark either, for people with deeper skin tones. That;s particularly disappointing because the Fit Me foundation goes much lighter and darker than the concealer shades. Seriously Maybelline, how do 9 shades (6 originally) "fit" everyone?*As a side note, for some reason the shade 15 is lighter than 10. I'm not really sure why they ordered them that way
very natural finish. Not really buildable or full coverage.
Super hydrating and good coverage
Great. I use to cover undereyes for coverage and highlighting. Works great
I was looking for a contouring color.  I picked this one worried that it was TOO dark for me.I understand that there’s always a difference in color based on monitors but I can use this as a HIGHLIGHTER.The colours are so totally different than the actual product
The color compliments my skin just right especially without being able to test it first! Great product!
It’s so smooth and easy to spread out liked it
My favorite concealer. I used to not use any kind of liquid makeup until i tried this product on a whim, for my under eye area. Now i use it all over! I use a damp beauty blender and use the fair color under my eyes and everywhere under where I highlight. I also blend in light sometimes around my forehead and cheeks because i usually look so pale, and it blends really well into my skin without looking too dark. I will also use fair under my brows to make them look more defined.The best thing about this product is that it doesn't feel heavy on my skin. I have very greasy skin, and as long as I go back and set my makeup with powder it stays on without making my face look like a complete greasy mess by the end of the day.The coverage is just okay. Under my eyes, it does great but for covering redness around my cheeks and nose, not so much. That goes for concealing blemishes too. It's probably not the best liquid makeup in the world, but I'm not complaining. And i'm definitely not complaining about the price. It's a small tube but it lasts me awhile.
It doesn't show up like I was hoping but it is light weight
This is perfect for my undereye area, and it conceals other spots pretty well. I do bake to help it set, but I typically don't need to reapply during the day. Keep in mind that I'm not exactly active, so I can't speak to staying power when someone sweats a bit more, but it does work for someone like me, who is more sedentary at a desk job. It's light enough that it does help conceal and brighten around the eyes. I'm not a pale princess, but I also can't use it as contour besides the area under my eyes, so it still works pretty well for someone like me.It hasn't irritated my eyes, as far as I know, either, and they tend to be fairly sensitive to irritants. I haven't had breakouts, either, in the areas I use it to spot-conceal, so it appears to be fairly good for my combination dry/oily skin. (It's a weird place to be skin-wise, but I work with it.) I haven't noticed oxidation, which was a problem I had with another brand.As far as drugstore brand concealers go, this one is perfect for me.
My office coordinator told me about the "Fit" makeup line. So, I decided to try it. Let me tell you...it is AMAZING! The concealer fits my skin tone, to a "T". Plus, the price was super inexpensive! I had previously spent $80 on a product, that wasn't even close to matching my skin tone; even though I took a "match your skin tone test." But, the Fit concealer is definitely a keeper. The transaction was smooth and the shipment arrived super quick! Thanks bunches! This will be a repeat purchase for this concealer.
Probably my fault but I ordered to dark of a shade and so now I have an orange concealer lol
This product never disappoints! Ive been using it for years! I love the coverage it provides me with!
The product is nice and was well shipped and packaged even though amazon always uses a way to big box but it still works. It’s a nice color but it didn’t really match my skin tone but that would be my fault for not picking the right color but it was a bit orange. When first trying the product first thing I noticed when blending was it was not at all covering anything. It was almost just wiping of my face on to the brush. I gave this to my sister to try and she used a Beauty blender and still no coverage wiped right onto the brush nothing on her face. Don’t bye this unless you really want it to be a no coverage concealer
It covers but you need Spf tinted moisturizer before you apply this
It’s so smooth and easy to spread out liked it
Price, good coverage and last a long time.
I purchased this accidentally while looking for a different brand name -  you know how the ads pop up when you type the name of the product you want in the search bar?  So I thought I was buying my regular brand and was surprised when I received this brand. I had to go back to look at my order to see that I actually ordered this one.In any event, it works fine.  It would be nice to receive a little more product in the container, but it covers and blends well.  I would probably buy it again... even on purpose!
I found this concealer to be very drying. It doesn’t spread easily and the color was a poor match for me. I like Maybelline products, but this was a disappointment.
Not bad at all, only flaw is it could last a bit longer tbh
Won't by this again. Color is good but it cakes really bad and dries my skin out.
Cakey not easy to mix in,don't like it
My dermatologist recommends this fit-me line of makeup because it is non-comedogenic. I used it as foundation without using any powder and the look is more natural with very good coverage. The only problem is it is small tube and does not last long. I just started using it and not sure how long the small tube will last me. It can end up being expensive because I use it as foundation instead of concealer. As a concealer I think it is perfect and good value.
The coverage was exactly what I needed to even out my dark circles and lasted all day. This is my go-to concealer.
I chose shade 15 fair.  Surprisingly, it was the perfect match for my skin.  I also got the foundation in shade 115.  Perfect.  For comparison, I am shade 202 in Loreal's infallible foundation, shade light beige in elf's concealer, light in benefit's the big easy foundation, and porcelain in too faced's born this way foundation.I have dry to normal skin so I hate mattes.  This one is definitely a very dewy foundation and it lasts all day.  I love it.  Will definitely repurchase.I also have very sensitive skin.  I have found that I am allergic to neutrogena and catrice and la girl formulas but this one is gentle on my skin.  So if you have sensitive skin, this is for you.Only reason why I didn't give this four stars is because it doesn't completely cover dark circles all day, it will fade.
This is a good product to enhanceUnexpected, I was using it to cover up a part of my face and it really does a good job at highlighting. So if you apply it in just the right amount (easy to over apply with the tool given ... which is disastrous) it can be an attribute as well.The amount was good too for the price. No issues.The color... I was scared by so many reviews so I went with a bit lighter than I really consider myself. I think it could swing either way. If you over apply you will look ridiculous no matter what the color is so that is the key thing... to be subtle.Did well in covering up what I was trying to cover up for a few weeks and I only had to apply once a day.Note: I do not have PRIME since Amazon.com does NOT stand behind their BS mark-up service and have become WORSE since they started pushing it so much at delivering non PRIME items.
Great
Okay, this doesn't last for an exceptionally long time. But the product itself in terms of the container is amazing. It's really amazing to use and does a fantastic job of helping to spread the makeup. I've kept the case since I ran out of the liquid and I just put my foundation inside it now. It can be a little difficult to fill it up, but it's so worth it considering how easy the dabber makes application.
Very exceptional quality! Glorious delivery. The packaging was ever so ideal. Service was excellent.
I love this concealer and keep going back to it! I've been using this concealer for probably about 8 years, and I use it to conceal my dark circles nearly everyday. My dark circles are a result of thin skin under my eyes (so they're bluish/purple in color), and I instantly look more awake after applying this concealer. I love that I can put a small amount of this under my eyes in the morning and it lasts all day and doesn't crease. I don't like heavy makeup and never wear foundation, so I like that this is lightweight and easy to blend. I use it as a spot concealer for any redness as well and it works great. #15 is also perfect for my pale skin, I've always struggled with concealers being too pinkish or yellow for my skin tone, but this one matches me perfectly. Also, I once accidentally bought #10 instead of #15 because I was in a rush at the drugstore, and #10 is actually darker/warmer than #15. So if you're pale, go with #15!
Covers up my dark circles under my eyes… doesn’t last as long as all day but great for an evening out
The products of Maybelline New York always meet my expectations!
I got probably the lightest shade and it was darker than my foundation shade!! It's a great concealer if you have tanner skin, but if you're even slightly paler than most, I do not recommend.... Unless you looking for a contour shade or something.... 😬
I do not know how this stuff stays on so well. It's like paint, but it's not uncomfortable nor does it crack. Somehow I put this concealer on after I put on sunscreen and it stays in place. I can't get the color to match my skin perfectly, I've tried a few shades. But I just blend it in and it's fine, set with powder. But the effective and longevity is EXTRAORDINARY! Ordering a second container. Seriously, this is phenomenal. It still looks good 6 hours later and I'm 42 with 3 kids running around inside and outside, working at home, playdates at the park... I'm shocked. Can you tell? Lol. Great product.
So, this is my first concealer. My second Summer pregnancy was not kind to me and left me with ALL the melasma. (And the baby has gifted me dark circles lol)  For only 3 bucks, I'd say this does a pretty great job. I am in no way savvy with makeup...i just applied it with my finger. I am sure it would be even better if I used the correct tool. You can definitely tell a difference in my example photo. It seems to last as long through the day as any of my other makeup. Will purchase again for sure.
I’ve been using this concealer for over a year and I love it.
This is the only concealer I use. The shade matches my skin perfectly and is perfect for dry skin.
Great value
Loved it!
perfect definitely my fav brand!
Great coverage and it’s doesn’t cake on
the only concealer i use !!
Really Love The Application Of This Product Covers Really Well And The Look Is Flawless.
The applicator was just about bone dry as well as what was remaining in the container.  It appeared that this particular product was sitting around somewhere for quite awhile to be so dry.  Very disappointing!  Understandably the product has to be returned within (2-4 HOURS OF RECEIPT) being a cosmetic, however not knowing this fact and not opening it until three days after receipt, I own it.  I’ll know better next time.  Just be aware when you purchase cosmetics.  Glad it wasn’t that expensive! Oh well, live and learn.
It covers imperfections in my skin and looks natural!
I like it, but it does not cover so much. It is something more basic, for people who like a natural look.
I bought this after hearing the rave reviews from one of my favorite makeup YouTubers, Marlena from Makeup Geek and couldn't wait to get my hands on it and was ecstatic to find that it was cheaper here than at the drugstore.  I haven't been able to find a concealer that has staying power on my pale oily skin while simultaneously hiding the dreaded eye bags and occasional face demons.  The color is perfect, (I am very pale and it is hard to find a good color,) the texture is wonderful, it glides on like a dream and blends effortlessly.  The only issue I have with it is that it doesn't like to stay put very well, even if I apply primer and "bake" with powder.  I usually have to touch it up at least once during the day.  However, with the coverage, color, application and texture, I really don't mind.  I very much recommend this product.
It did its job as a good concealer that hides my sins but for the few hours I did put it on, I immediately had some acne flare up I noticed once I took it off. It’s covers up, but for more sensitive skin; it may clog pores. I got Sand and for my cool tone skin, it was a little orange but hid my lack of sleep well. I want to like it especially with this price point, but my skin says no.
Very happy. Price was right product was good
Matches perfectly
Quite thick. Blending with sheer lightweight moisturizer which thins & improves application. Good price & value.
Love longevity of the product feels really silky really bendable
The best for great price.
this is my favorite concealer and pretty good price
But looks great
Great for the "I'm wearing makeup but that's non of your business" look. This color is perfect for someone who considers themselves pale but peachy. I have red undertones due to facial eczema or psoriasis (don't remember which) If it were winter I'd need the lighter shade but it's summer so I need the slight yellow tone to match my slight tan. It's not meant to be matte so it doesn't dry your skin out! It looks very natural. I put some powder on top of it after a few hrs of wear because it can get a oily if not.
I have tried many under eye concealers for my dark circles. This was my first time trying this one and I tried it based on it's great reviews. Well the very first day I wore it I had more than one person ask me if I had a "black eye", which told me it must not be working well for me. I have now re-ordered a completely different brand and will toss this one and the other shade I ordered once my new brand arrives.
cheap and perfect seriously!
it’s rlly creamy and doesn’t dry up and lasts long
Excellent coverage for red spotsand  evens skin tone. I prefer to add to areas on top of foundation so it doesn’t spread too much.
I can always count on Maybelline. I have used their products for years. Great coverage and easy to apply. I would highly recommend it.
Nice coverage
I have sworn by this product in Fair for three years now - a friend had it, I tried it, and I had to have it. A tube of this stuff will last me nearly a year, as it has such good coverage! I have awful undereye circles, and this stuff covers it like you wouldn't believe. Considering the price, I can't recommended any makeup product more than Fit Me Liquid Concelear.Just a bit of a heads up, the tub lid does leak a little bit. Not a lot, but as you'll have it for a while before you run out, the outside of the tube will end up covered in a thin layer of the concealer. Worth it considering the price.
It’s really creamy. The color matches perfectly and I think it’s pretty moisturizing. Price is amazing for it too! Surprised because of the quality. It’s a little small but for the price I can’t complain.
Very good concealer, i got a color that is slightly darker than I expected, but that’s not a big deal, it blends nicely and holds up pretty well, not too light and not too cakey, it’s just right, does not seem to oxidize, very good price. But i will say that there isn’t much product in my opinion it lasted a lot less than other concealers I’ve had in the past. It is a pretty good concealer, nothing mind blowing though, but you really cannot complain much because of the price, i will say for it’s price it’s pretty good. But I don’t think I’ll buy it again, I’d rather have a concealer that is just as good if not better for a few extra bucks and that would last a lot more than this one.
Men don’t use concealer, right? Wrong. Smart ones do, very scarcely, here and there. I always keep it around with Skin that is unpredictable under stress. This comes in an insane amount of shades, holds up well enough and is a great bang for buck. Skip the fancy men’s concealers. You’ll pay double for an inferior product in a more elegant & manly package.This works well for me, only in rare situations.No one has ever been able to tell. That’s the key. Highly recommended.
Very full coverage but rubs and sweats off easy
I like the applicator tip. I've heard that this is supposed to be a dupe to NARS Radiant Concealer.  I didn't want to pay $30+ for that, so I decided to try this. Picking a color was difficult online, but I went with Hazelnut. For reference, I'm a medium brown skinned African-American woman (like the color of mahogany wood). It goes on looking light, but blends out to a darker shade. The coverage is medium. Not full, and not sheer. It is, however, buildable. I can't speak to whether it creases or not, as I have not worn it for a full day yet. I'd definitely recommend a setting powder if creasing is a concern for you. I'd say this concealer is worth a try!
I am upset and extremely disappointed in Amazon.  This product appears used.  The product was delivered with a broken safety seal and some kind of sticky residue on the applicator...showing signs of use...disgusting.Update: I have changed my initial 1-star review to 5-stars.Reason for update:  I requested a refund from Amazon, which was immediately approved.  Additionally, Amazon promptly sent a brand new replacement which I received today (sent within two days). Thanks Amazon!
I love this concealer. I use the shade HONEY 30 which is a perfect match for me. It has a golden undertone and is for medium skin tones. The finish is so natural, yet it has enough coverage to cover up any blemishes. It's also perfect for acne-prone skin.
This is easily the BEST concealer I have ever used!  Once upon a time when Maybelline still made their Mineral Power concealer in my color (Ivory) I thought I had found the best concealer.  But when I switched to this one, I realized that THIS was the best affordable concealer out there.  I use the shade 15 Fair, which actually matches my skin better than the Ivory did.  Most mornings I dab a tiny bit on each of my blemishes and lightly blend it in.  My nose gets pink whenever I get too hot or too cold, so I always blend a little of this concealer on it in the morning to maintain even coloring in my face.  The fantastic thing about this concealer is that it looks about as good by the time I go to bed as it looked when I first put it on fresh.  Because some areas on my face are oily, and other areas are dry, I always apply Olay face lotion first before applying this Fit Me concealer so it goes on smooth and even.
Always on the hunt for my holy grails but this has been it for the concealer category for years. It’s difficult to find your shade as a fair skin girl like others have said. They stopped selling Ivory in stores I think because I can only find on Amazon. But Ivory is better than fair for pale with yellow undertones. And as others have stated the Light shade is very deceiving name and is kinda tan and makes the red worse in my skin.But this stuff is the best and literally all I need. Proof expensive isn’t always better.
Update: Oct/2020:I still feel the same way about this concealer, you absolutely cannot go wrong. I still use and love it.This is probably my favorite concealer at the moment, which is saying a lot considering I have so many both drug store and high end concealers. This is perfect for the summer time when you want decent coverage but nothing too thick and that sweats off. It blends perfectly with a beauty blender and conceals all redness, and my favorite is that it is very lightweight and not cakey whatsoever.Many people would compare this to the NARS creamy concealer , and they are simular in packaging however this one is much less creamy and in my opinion, easier to blend and more build able. I feel like the NARS one sinks into any fine lines and creases way more than this one, I never had a problem with creasing with the maybelline fit me concealer. Overall, I would definitely buy it again it's just perfect and the price can't be beat. Buy it, you won't regret it.
Lasts all day, THE SHADES AREN'T WACKY, and isn't drying, can be built up if you want less of a natural look, I'd take this over the camo because elf just makes the oddest shades with the oddest undertones with gaps in their range
My favorite concealer! So easy to color match (I held my wrist up to compare colors and it ended up being the perfect one). It goes on creamy, blends very well, and lasts all day!
I had used expensive Clinique for years, and their similar product was discontinued. I saw this and decided to give it a try for a fraction of the cost. It is fantastic!  I like it even better! It covers my dark circles under my eyes, and blends in perfectly. My husband is a retired dermatologist and he gives it a thumbs up!
I bought this to try and Wow what a shocking disappointment! I am Fair skinned and wanted a hint of color more than the Ivory under my eyes, this seemed like the best choice before getting into a beige.As soon as Started to apply lightly it looked yellowish in my 10x mirror. I finished my normal light dab and when i looked into the regular mirror ...I was correct--It has an extreme Yellow base instead of being the color they show as Sand.  There was no second thoughts , I had to wash it off and apply the Ivory.Absolutely a waist of money when the product does not even resemble the perfect color you see in the container........I guess there really is a "First" for everything.If you do not want a Yellow base then do not purchase this product.I will be staying with the Porcelain or Ivory which matches my complexion.
Lots of different different colors to choose from
Love this it works well and it is so much cheaper than in store
Yes
Definitely offers good coverage. Burns sometimes when applying to eye and nose area, but only slightly. The sensation goes away after blending. Covers acne pretty well and dark spots VERY well. All in all, offers great coverage. Does crease if you apply too much. This concealer has not made me break out.
Under eye dark circles
Great product! Coverage is awesome!
It matches and blends well
It definitely covered up my dark circles, zits, etc. but it’s soooo cakey and looks weird on my skin. I have normal, oily but dry skin and it just didn’t work for me.
I returned the highly priced Chanel concealer and bought this concealer to save money. The concealer works as good as or better that the Chanel concealer. It has more products in it than the Chanel concealer. When using it, best to pat and blend with your finger or beauty blender, don't use the brush as it will move the concealer. Leave until it is kinda dry, then can put translucent powder. I love this and I will buy it again.
This seems to be a good product, but it's hard to select makeup colors online.  I have light skin, and need a cooler color tone.  I did my best to match my tone from the online photos of each color.
Great for under eye circles.
The problem with buying make up online when you don't know your shade is that you can try to look for the right one but it won't always line up. This is what happened to me
I have used this since it first came out - I think it is one of the best drugstore concealers. It is easy to blend, has the right amount of creamy/tackiness (which makes it easier to blend). The only downfall, is that it may be difficult to find a perfect match since there are so many different types of skin tones. It also does not stay on as long as I like, even with setting with a powder. It doesn't cake up, unless my skin is really dry.I have been using this in my quick morning routine. I first apply a moisturizer, let it soak in - then apply a powder foundation. Then I use this concealer and Maybelline's undereye concealer and let it sit a few minutes before I blend it out. It is quick, easy, and gives a flawless look.
Works great for it’s price
I'd normally suspend judgement until after I've worn it but I just put it on and it's great! It really covers up blemishes. I've been struggling to conceal a bit of acne on my chin and it did it fantastically. the only problem I have so far is that it stings a little when added to acne or something similar.
This is an extremely small bottle, so you use it up fairly quickly and it doesn’t seem to last long
So far, my favorite drug store concealer. I typically shop high end products, but things just tend to fall into my cart whenever I'm out and about lol. I tried the fit me foundation, and its become a holy grail for me, so I figured I'd give this a shot, It's not full coverage, it has a natural looking finish, and it's lightweight. For those reasons I enjoy using it on light makeup days under the eyes. Their shade range isn't that great, and this brand also does animal testing, which are huge cons in ny book, but overall, I do enjoy the product. I bought it mostly for testing and review purposes, otherwise I stay far away from anything that isn't vegan or cruelty free.
Ordered 2 of these. I was a little sketchy that they did not come with the tamper seal on it like this product does in store...it seems ok though.
The shade was a little too light but it was very easy to apply. It also completely covered my dark circles. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product.
I bought Medium 025, Cafe 030, and Deep 035. I assumed based on the number system and names that Medium would be the lightest of the three with Deep would be the darkest. In actuality, Cafe is the darkest and the match for my skintone. As far as contouring,  the purpose of these purchases, two lighter shades and one matching shade is not quite the ideal one lighter one matching and one darker like I needed. The reason this particular color received four stars and not five, like the other two colors did, is because I fully expected 025 to be the lightest and 030 to be my match. I did NOT expect 035 to be in between 025 & 030... it's actually kind of blowing my mind...I thought I had thought this through well enough before my purchase.
It didn't  do much for me. Was watery and didn't cover anything
I have this concealer in two shades, 10 Light and 25 Medium. I use a combination of both for my under eyes and just the 10 Light for spot concealer. Two things to note: 1) This is a medium-coverage concealer so it won't necessarily cover everything in one go and; 2) It's buildable, which is great because I can use a dab to cover a dark spot or healing zit, and then build up layers in another place that needs a little extra coverage. It's not the type to replace foundation like some of the other concealers do but it does the job. And it doesn't break me out even with consistent daily usage! Win for me!
I found this concealer doesn't cover my rosacea nearly as well as ELF concealer. ELF concealer offers total coverage. This is lighter coverage. That being said, it is moisturizing and lightweight. I'll keep it around for light touchups or small blemishes.
I just bought this for a second time! As far as cheap or “drugstore” options, this is one of the best concealers out there! Obviously Tarte’s Shape Tape is the market leader and for good reason: it’s an incredible product but sometimes I just don’t want to spend that much on makeup! Sometimes i just want to have a cheap option that costs $5 that I’m not going to be tempted to ration out or only use on special occasions. If you’re like me, try this concealer!
sheer, also too dark.
This concealer works great. It has the perfect size doe foot applicator. Most concealers work on my under eyes but very few look good and completely cover healing zits but this one does. It is just moist enough to not cake but not too liquidly that you need to chase it around your face and hassle with setting powders. My skin is on the drier side and sensitive but this does not cling to my dry patches or break me out.The reason I took one star away is because of the colors... light is too yellow and medium is a little pink therefore it looks a little off on my light-medium, neutral skintone. But overall great concealer... one of my favorites. No smell, no gross separation, not drying, not runny, and didn't break me out.
Good
Purchased to cover under eye, dark circles & it was the perfect color, nice blend overall very happy!
Love this! It covers really well and lasts all day. I can use it alone or with foundation. I have a light complexion and blue eyes and the fair is a perfect match for me. Doesn’t look cakey around my 62 year old eyes. Will order again.
I really like this product. It doesn't make me break out, and even though I'm in my 20's, I have very sensitive skin. It's a bit lighter than expected, but I still used it for highlighting and covering those pesky spots, when they show! I recommend this product to anyone because it is lightweight and I used it during my internship while working at Disney World in the summer in that hot and humid weather and it still seemed to mostly last. 4 stars and not 5 because it is definitely worth the price, and I can tell it is on the lower end of the spectrum when it comes to make-up, but the price is right and I'm about to buy it again!
So easy to spread on.Feels so good to your Face.
This concealer is the worst ive ever tried. When I used it for the first time it was ok, but then after a few days of using it I broke out, my skin got super dry, and my skin gor super oily. I do NOT recommend this.
Love it
I like that it looks nice. You have to put it on lightly, other wise it can be thick. It lasts pretty long & moisturizing I didnt notice it.
My skin is a bit sensitive and I'm really starting to get those fine lines all around my eyes where the skin ages a little faster (plus, I'm closing in on 40!). The color worked great for my skin tone, and using a beauty blender with this helped keep the coverage even but light all around my eyes, making it look a good bit softer, and helped mask the lack of sleep the night before. :) I usually get a breakout feeling from foundation and concealers so I've never really used them, but I had no issue with this. My skin has always been normal, but is leaning toward dry as I get older. This didn't feel oily or create that ugly shine, and the wand helps place the product in a nice even way. I think it's a fantastic product if you're cost conscious or cost-prohibited from getting different brands, well worth the money.
This is a fantastic affordable concealer. It has a doe foot applicator, which makes it easy to apply. This concealer has great lasting power. It holds up through my entire work day. I haven’t experienced any problems with melting either. If you’re looking for an affordable medium coverage concealer, this is the one for you! I like using two shades—the shade Medium for covering any spots or discoloration on my face, and the shade Light for under my eyes and on my forehead to brighten those areas, kind of like a highlighter without using highlighter if you know what I mean.
I love love love this concealer! I used a bottle of NARS vanilla and needed a new concealer but did not want to spend $30 on one bottle. After spending much time watching reviews, I finally ordered this concealer. It is fantastic for the price! It is a little less creamy than the NARS creamy concealer (go figure) but it works very well and lasts a long time! I was my face occasionally throughout the day so sometimes I have to reapply, but it is never completely gone. When I was at Sephora, I was told by a worker to buy a shade lighter than your skin color to help brighten your eyes. I ordered both the light and fair, but the fair was a bit too pale for me. Even now during the summer, the light seems to be getting a bit light (as expected since I am more tan, but I may order a shade darker to use during the summer
Haven't had a chance to try out the product ( other than a swatch test ) and I already like it! I was a bit worried about matching my skin ( cuz I'm pale as a ghost👻), but did well with this! It is definitely going to blend in well and give me that sun kissed look🥰And for my swatch test, a little baby dap went a long way❤Can't wait to use!!
Perfect match
I did not like this concealer at all. The coverage was horrible, creases and was too oily.
Really happy with this inexpensive product.
I own both the fair and light shades.  I wear fair in winter and light in the summer when I have a little bit of tan.  This is a great concealer for the money.  I wear it almost every day on my under eye area and I’ve already repurchased once.  I honestly like this better my Nars and Benefit concealers.  It goes on smoothly and covers well.  I blend it with a real techniques brush I got at target
I loveeeeeee this concealer! The color is perfect and the coverage is pretty good. My friends also complemented me and told me my skin looked really smooth. The only small problem is that I have oily skin so I can’t rlly tell if it’s good for all day wear. But overall this is the best concealer I’ve ever had. :)
Absolutely love this concealer. When it comes to foundation, I usually opt for the more expensive brands just because they've worked better for me. However, I find that this concealer has worked just as well - if not better, than the designer concealer brands I've tried. It's not only the perfect color for my skin but also an amazing consistency. The wand makes application mess-free. Love this product and the fact that it's on Amazon makes my life that much better.
This does not seem like the same concealer I have bought from beauty store. At least it works for a an hour or so. But the same one I have bought from the beauty store lasts me all day without re-applying.  I have to use a lot more of this one and gets used up faster.
Good concealer but I got the wrong shade. Shades are not very accurate .
a lot darker than the picture :( i have pink undertones so it was too orangey on me
First time buying this… not disappointing at all considering the price
It worked for my darkskin
I like the coverage and and the price and how easy it is to use
This concealer goes on wet but immediately thickens up and blends very well. I think it has very good coverage and I like the applicator. The color is lovely, my only gripe is that the very palest color (10) is too yellow and too dark for my skin tone, but the 15 Fair, which has great pink undertones for fair skin like mine, is a bit dark. It is definitely way too dark for my winter coloring, but I use self tanner in the spring/summer and it will match that so I will still get a lot of use out of it. However, if you are super fair and never self tan, you might want to find another product because this will be too dark.
Love the coverage. Great for undereye circles. This is a good concealer.
i bought this thinking oh i usually buy it slightly more expensive at walmart/target. RED FLAG NUMBER ONE. i don’t think too much of it but then it comes in the mail with no seal no sticker nothing!! so i request a replacement because hello this was clearly used before! my replacement comes in and it has the same exact issue. RED FLAG NUMBER TWO so i’m just like whatever let me try it out and my under eye starts burning along with the spots of concealer that i used to cover my other blemishes so i’m horrified! RED FLAG NUMBER THREE!!in conclusion i think this is a fake maybelline seller like it’s probably off brand because i have used the original maybelline with no problems and it definitely comes with nice packaging but this one did not. oh and i purchased the shade 25 for references. i’m not sure if all the other shades are like this but beware!
I usually use a fairly light shade, so I went with this. Well, it’s waaay too light, and aside from that it provides very little coverage. I’m really not sure what to do with it now, but it’s definitely not for me. I’ll stick with my NYX
I have terrible bags under my eyes and I try and comaflague them with this.  The bags are still there but it does make them blend in better. It also helps freckles and age spots or blemishes if they are in healing mode.
I have EXTREMELY bad dark circles under my eyes and I’ve struggled to find a concealer to cover them and make them at least somewhat disappear. This concealer did just that! My complexion looks smooth and you can’t tell that I have dark circles at all! I would recommend pairing this with the Maybelline Fit Me Pressed Powder if you’re using it for under your eyes so it doesn’t look as shiny. 10/10 recommend! Very happy with my purchase!
It's a fantastic concealer and easily buildable!
Wish it wasn't so expensive but it is what it is. wish it hid my acne a little better
The product doesn’t spread and it seems dried uo
Try as I might with other concealers, I always come back to this one. The formula is perfect. I have combination skin that usually goes oily and separates the product. But when I wear this my skin never looks too oily or too cakey. It doesn't suck up my pores or transfer. The coverage is perfect and also buildable. I don't wear foundation, I just use concealer to cover up discoloration/spots, and this is the only one that has matched my skin so perfectly that I don't have to cake on my entire face. Save your money with concealers $10+, $15+, $30, I've tried them and am always amazed that this one is just BETTER!
I’ve used the fit me foundation in golden caramel for a few years and it’s a perfect match for me. This concealer is too orange and a bit too dark.
Good concealer. Not drying, yet not oily either. Creamy thick formula, so it stays on well...moderately well. I do need to touch up blemishes throughout the day. The price is reasonable. Doesn't break me out, nor does it have harsh ingridents or scents in it. Gives decent coverage too. It's very much like Nars creamy concealer.
Ok for the price, still not great though.
I really did not like this at first. I am PALE and this concealer was too dark for me. The coverage was REALLY good though. I was not expecting that. I bought this to use as an under eye concealer and to lighten my nose and forehead. I was really sad that it was too dark for me. I seriously need to invest in white paint lol. Everything about the concealer was great except it wasn't light enough for me. I still use it, I just cover up and red areas or blemishes then put my foundation over it. The wand is great to. Makes it easy to apply and you dont have to get your fingers messy!
For a price is a good product
It feels good on the skin and it is really high quality for the price! Great coverage
everyday bc i have ugly skin so it covers it, 5 stars
The product box was not tampered but the product itself was already opened and used I am seeking a refund for it. They tried to hide the fact that it was used by putting a white sticker on it. But the actual sticker that came on the product was already used and most of the product is gone.
For the price and quality, this concealer is a winner. I have this both in shade 20 and 10. When I'm in a rush, I can use shade 20 in lieu of foundation. If not, I just use it to conceal the mild redness on my cheeks, uneven tone down the center of my face, and under my eyes. I have combo fair skin with a yellow undertone, so it doesn't crease except for right around my nose and blends well on the rest of my face. I use shade 10 as a highlight and for hyperpigmented spots on my face. I've gone through 2 tubes of shade 20 and am ready for my next S&S shipment where I'll receive a fresh new one. I highly recommend this concealer, especially to my fellow budget beauties. Just be careful not to purchase when this product exceeds $6, usually it's $4-5.
This is good if you’re going for that natural look. It does not cover dark circles  all the way though
I ordered this because I recently went to the beach and needed a tanner concealer. It was a little darker than I expected but what can you do when ordering makeup off the internet. I own about 5 of these concealers in different shades and the main complaint I have is that while they are dewey, they really bring out the oil in my skin. Like I love how they look with no powder but since I have combination skin, throughout the day their on my t-zone really comes out with powder, I couldn't image how bad it would be without. With that said really good and affordable concealer. Will be buying again.
I use this product as a highlight for my contour. This product was recommended to me by one of my favorite beauty bloggers so I thought I would give it a shot. I really do enjoy the way that it accentuates my contour. The reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because if I was thinking of this as a concealer, it really did not do much when it comes to covering up the dark circles under my eyes or my blemishes which is ultimately what you want a concealer to be able to do; however, for the price, it acts as a really great highlight so I would recommend it for that purpose.
I took a chance buying this without ever trying it. I was lucky to get a match right away for my skin tone. I was pretty impressed. I usually use Clinique because I don't like how department store foundation and concealer feel, but this is smooth and light and lets my skin breathe. I really like this and plan on buying more. I'm thinking about trying the foundation too, but im a little worried about finding the right shade. Luckily, Amazon has a great return policy on both products!
Love! Just the right color for my fair complexion (not too much yellow like some other brands). I don't have dark circles or anything but this definitely helps brighten up my eyes and give face a fresh look. I also use it to cover up some hyperpigmentation on my nose and chin. Tested it while out wearing my mask today and it stayed put pretty well.
I decide to try this one  for the price ! I just give it a try and it was so so good  it match my skin so goodit doesn't crease  at all and i've tried expensive ones but this one just become my fave  I dont feel my pores clog it covers very well its such a great product for a natural look :)
I haven't used the product much yet but I noticed a lot of people were writing reviews about how theirs was open. Mine was not! It came in the mail perfectly intact, if I decide the skin tone fits me and I like the product I would totally purchase it again!
at first I thought the color was too light but then in normal light it was fine. I used shade 10 fair.
really great coverage
I purchased this item after searching for cut crease concealer and reading the amazing reviews. It has minimal to moderate coverage. Definitely not full coverage, and virtually useless to those that like a smokey eye with cut crease. Might be nice for those wanting a sheer to minimal, maybe moderate coverage concealer.
This concealer is perfect for my mocha/cocoa skin tone. its not too thick so i apply just a tad under my eyes, top lip and bridge of my nose, i usually let it sit for 2-3 minutes before i blot away with the beauty blender then i add a setting poder over it, but in all honesty, it does not make my face look ashy or dry. i have not broken out and its also been easy to wash and wipe away by the end of the day. its given me an all day stay. i'll be using this concealer from now on because the others ive tried have been to thick and made me look like a ghost!
So I bought this concealer to show these girls that men can pull off makeup. To my surprise this concealer made me look great I got many compliments. People asked about my skin care routine and I told them I use this concealer! Still use it too
My wife absolutely loves this. She says it’s perfect to hide the dark circles under your eyes.
I use it every day for a year and a half and I couldn’t be happier. Before I discovered this, I was using an expensive concealer from Sephora which was drying my skin under the eyes and it made my wrinkles even more obvious!! But FitMe is very soft, blends good and covers all the spots and blemishes which I have on my skin. I also ordered their foundation which is perfect!!! Not to mention that it stays on the entire day. I work in a restaurant, it’s a physical work, I sweat a lot and I touch my face A LOT. It even stays ON even if I use napkins on my skin (like blowing my nose)
love how natural it looks on my skin, I bought 15 light and 20 Sand and it’s a pretty good match. I used it all over the face instead of foundation and it does the job! The only problem is how fast it creases under my eyes, as soon as I blend it out I have to set it to prevent serious creasing. It’s a good medium coverage concealer and if you build it up it doesn’t look cakey and I mean for the price it’s worth it!
Love this product and used often without applying makeup over. Would order a lighter shade next time as this was slightly yellow than expected.
I liked the coverage of this under eye concealer and was amazed it wasn't like the other product I use to buy.I like to cover the dark circles but want it to feel light not heavy.I will definitely buy this product again. great company I like honest advertising.
it felt it was Burning my eyes! next day got sore eyes!
The product itself I had bought before and works great, I just never bought from this seller. The product never arrived that is why I am leaving a 1 star review-
I am totally satisfied with this product. The color is perfect and it blends perfectly. An excellent choice for the price.
The color was a little off, but that’s not the company’s fault. I ordered the light shade when I should have ordered the fair one as I am very pale. It did cover well, but for some reason when I put it under my eyes it stung a little (not enough to quit using it or anything).The lettering came off on my hands as well.
It's a good concealer but it doesn't conceal certain parts of my skin as much as I thought it would but it does the job. It does stay on for almost the whole day which is good.
I have used this product many times before, and have sometimes switched to other sometimes more expensive concealers but keep coming back to this one.  It's very reasonably priced and a little goes a long way so it lasts.  I prefer the color "Fair" as opposed to the color "Light" but Fair always seems to be sold out at my local stores.  Fair is better for cool toned skin (like mine). 'Light' is too yellow for me and looks much better on warm or more olive skin tones.  A little dab, gently patted in with a clean fingertip, does the trick, either under foundation or over. Not waxy, chalky nor greasy. It stays put. Really like this product.
I bought this product in combination with the "L.A. Girl Pro Coneal Hd. High Definiton Concealer 0.25 Ounce 990 Orange" . They both together is a power pack. It hides your dark circles very nicely and you don't even see it in the camera lights.
I love all Maybelline products. I had a fit me phase where all I would do is buy the fit me products. The foundation, powder, concealer, etc. And then I stopped buying the fit me and went to superstay and then one day i decide to buy the fit me concealer and it reminded me just how much i loved it.The coverage is great and the concealer itself is liquidy and not that thick, which i love and it’s easy to blend out.
Maybelline products are timeless. I love this concealer. It has great coverage and the concealer matches my skin color. I apply with my finger or a slightly damp sponge. It lasts all day
As we all know, covering shadows under your eyes is very tough. I once knew a woman who successfully covered her shadows, but she used six thin coats of concealer and it took her two hours.This stuff is good, but I think you’d have to make a serious effort to cover your shadows. For most of us, two hours is too much. At least I wear glasses and can cover the shadows that way.
This is good concealer, but did get creasy after two applications. I bought foundation, concealer, and powder in this Fit Me line, and I'm very happy with them. This concealer has a very nice cool tone - I have trouble finding concealer that doesn't turn my under-eye yellow - and blends beautifully. It doesn't cover perfectly, and when I applied a second layer with powder, it creased pretty badly. However, it was very light and comfortable to wear, and looked very natural. I might try a higher end concealer at some point, but I'm pretty happy with this one for now.
I had given up trying to find the perfect make-up for my finicky, fair skin when I purchased this concealer. My expensive, less-than-stellar BB cream had run out, so I figured for $5, how could I go wrong? Even now, I can't believe how RIGHT this product is for me (especially for the price)! This covers every blemish perfectly, yet still somehow allows some natural pigmentation to show through. After applying the concealer, I finish with Maybelline's "Fit Me Matte Poreless Powder", shade Porcelain. Next time I will try Translucent for an even better match (seriously, my skin is Vampiric). The combo creates a naturally flawless look, blush optional!Note: I received no incentive to purchase this product or write this review. Just a VERY happy customer!
I use the fit me foundation and love it...so I thought I would give this a try too.  It is perfect!  I did get a shade lighter then my foundation and apply it over my foundation in a "V" shape.  Once I lightly brush it through I dab a few times with my foundation brush to achieve the perfect match.  I have very dark circles for lack of sleep and this is the best priced and very good quality concealer.  I am going to purchase a shade closer to my foundation shade to use around my line when touching up during the day with a lipstick brush.  I am 59 and this works very nicely for me.
I was using a very expensive department store product to cover up the eczema patches on my face about 3 years ago. I’m extremely self conscious about it and was convinced I needed an expensive product. I saw this on a newsfeed about great value products and bought it for my travel kit. It goes on smooth and creamy and doesn’t irritate my eczema. I actually prefer it over my expensive concealer that was almost 10 times the price.
I've heard many great things about this product and was anxious to try it out. I have slight dark circles under my eyes and this concealer does a marvelous job at concealing them and also brightening my under-eye area. This concealer is a not too thick and and not too thin, so applying it with a damp beauty blender is my favorite way to apply this product. I only have to apply once and it does exactly what it's supposed to do. I'd say that it's quickly becoming one of my favorite and must have concealers due to it's high coverage, on par with some of my higher end concealing products. This a great product to try and I highly recommend this! I'll definitely be buying one again when my tube runs out.
Color and texture was perfect.
It's very sheer.
I liked it
I don't like a lot retail store make up but this has been my go to concealer for 5 years now. I have oily skin so I like that it's  lightweight but gives me amazing coverage without settling into my pores or creases. Easily blends and is buildable. Best advice because of it's light weight feature is to let it "bake" with face powder before applying your foundation for maximum hold and that matte finish. I also like wearing it alone around the shadowy areas of my face and notice I don't need foundation afterwards. Which is perfect for my days off or when I want to give my face a foundation break.
Once you find the right shade it's a good product
Good product for the price. Color choice is nice. It's best to use a concealer brush with this product versus a beauty blender as the brush makes it easier to apply evenly.
I was skeptical about it because I’m ordering online but omg it really is fit me lol! I really don’t wear makeup but this is so natural it’s great to wear!!! I don’t leave reviews.....
The color I bought was too light & it didnt go well with my skin tone. But there's nothing wrong with the product itself. If I find my right concealer shade, of course I'd buy this brand again. Eventhough it wasn't my correct shade, it was a thick, all over concealer, which I will recommend this product. Just mke sure u knw ur correct shade. This seller was so understanding & refunded my money without any issues. He/she has a great customer service & wasted no time getting bck with me, after I had sent them an email.
This concealer had been opened and was not sealed at all.  The applicator wand was messy and obviously had been used.  Had to throw away.
I guess I didn't feel it was fair to leave a one or two star, since the concealer SEEMS good. However, if this is the "lightest" shade they have in existence right now, I do wish to request they keep us really pale people in mind during their next meeting! Because this is WAY too dark. I'm what I like to call "Casper shade with a hint of corpse".I can't wear this. And it's so much lighter looking in the screen than it is in person. This photo was taken in my bathroom but with natural light from the window.I'd make an oompa loompa jealous with the shade of orange id end up with if I wore this on my face.
I bought Hazelnut and Cocoa. I first purchased Cocoa and that was to dark for my face. So, I decided to try Hazelnut and that was ok but I don't like the red undertone.They both are really smooth and are easy to apply. You don't need at lot unless that's your thing. So a little goes a long way. It doesn't have that heavy feeling when you are wearing it which is great.
Amazing product dark circles and covered them! So inexpensive better than the 100”s IV spent in the past! I ordered four more that’s how much I love this product
I got the light one and the moment I applied under my eyes it looked really dark and orange.i wanted it to brighten my eye but instead it did the complete opposite.
Product is great, mine arrived unsealed.
i bought my daughter this because she was asking for it and she was doing very well in school so i decided to get it for her and she loved it and it looked really nice on her
I wish I would have taken a picture, I saw the concealers were on sale so I purchased 2, a dark and light shade, I use the dark concealer to contour and what I first noticed was the safety seal on my concealer had been really carefully sliced to look like it was still connected but was not, I still ended up trying it just to see if it was a fake and it went downhill from there, the concealer was SO dry and difficult to spread, piled into one spot when I tried to blend it and just looked terrible, I didn’t even try the other concealer I ordered.
I love this concealer. I have used it just about every day for the past 2-3 years. It's a great product. I will continue to buy it over and over again. I use it on imperfections, blemishes, and my terribly dark under eyes. It is very creamy and doesn't dry too fast, so it's easy to blend. I do notice it can crease a little under my eyes if I don't set it with a powder, but it is better than almost all of the drug store concealers when it comes to creasing, and with a little powder it will last all day. I would (and have!!) recommend this to friends or anyone who wants a high quality concealer that comes at a great price.
It’s nice for natural look. It doesn’t do a lot if coverage which make sense Bc it’s not expensive. But it’s good for a short amount of minutes/hours. As someone with genetically dark circles, this is not really coverage. So if u want something for coverage this is not it.
To be honest this arrived not sealed and it feels empty as hell. Like really only in the sides of the bottle. I like how it applies but it’s new and why does it seem empty? And not sealed??
This review is specifically for the shade MEDIUM - 25.I have the same concealer in sable - 20 and love it for highlighting under my eyes. I got this shade to neutralize darkness before highlighting.  Unfortunately, this shade (25) is too pink for me and women with similar undertones as mine (olive/yellow and gold) will find it hard to use. It's pretty pink/peachy in coloration -I tried to make it word but it came out looking odd. For Medium -medium tan skin with olive/yellow/gold undertones I recommend Maybelline's age rewind in Medium (for the right tone).TEXTURE- is fine for medium coverage, a little runny. Works ok by me but not meant for covering heavy dark circles/ blemishes.ADVISE FOR FUTURE BUYERS: Maybelline number their pink/peach undertones face products (concealers foundations, powders) with a 5 in the end. Example 15, 25, 25 etc while their Yellow/Olive toned products end with a 0 example. Keep that in mind before making a purchase.
Like: I’m an old gal, with more brown spots on face, yearly, and yet fair skin tone. I tried pricey cosmetics, science-created drops and photo light drops, and none worked. Rechecked products from decades ago. Found on Amazon the stock included a lighter tone than now-closed stores ever kept available. The lightest tone is pleasing me.
Color is a great match, and it is in a nice tube
Good
I haven’t used this item I gave it to a friend as a gift but before I could even give it to her the writing or brand name came off it looked like I used it but only had it for 4 days and never opened it .
Wish I could find a lighter shade; I'm the very lightest in their foundation range, and this was just a hair too dark on me. I can adjust it with powder and such, but still sort of saddening. Aside from the color, though, I like it. It's like a cheaper alternative to the Nars Radiant Creamy concealer; blends about the same, still needs to be set with powder. It creased a little under my eyes, but that tends to happen no matter WHAT I use, HOW I use it.
good product it covers my black circle but not 100% still good to the price I will buy it a gain
I have yellow skin but this color worked perfectly for me!Just as a blob it looked like it’s never going to blend in with my skin, but what do you know? Just a few little dabs made my skin look like clear jade.And it didn’t feel suffocating at all! I have combination skin and this worked for me!I 100% recommend!
Was not sealed at all.  Is thick.  Not sure if this was used already by someone!
The color is different from back in the day
This is one of the only beauty products I have used up completely and re-purchased three times. Being a beauty product junkie, this should speak to how great this concealer is. I love that it's creamy enough to use under the eyes and not cause dryness/creasing yet not SO creamy that you can use it on other areas of the face and it won't move around. I feel like this is comparable to the Nars creamy concealer for just a fraction of the price. The color is perfectly warm, yet fair so that you can also highlight your face without it turning ashy. I will continue to use this concealer for years to come.
Great for the price! Covers up my major under eye circles and does an okay job covering blemishes. Have bought about four of these in subscribe and save and keep using them again and again. Easy to blend and wears well!
You can create so many looks. I like the different shades they have. They are easy to blend.
I have to mix white consealer to take away the orange in this product
I really love this concealer, both as an under-eye, and blemish concealer.  However, I've found that there is something in it that causes burning ONLY under my eyes after I have used my face wash (Cerave Foaming Cleanser).  Nothing bad enough to make me not use it, I just try to wait longer after showering to use it, and make sure there is no other product under my eyes first.  I haven't had any issue with creasing, or melting, with or without primer.
Just received it today, I applied it with my whole makeup routine and it blended really well with my foundation, so happy and excited to finally find my shade.
Perfect color for my complexion but a bit thin.
I'm not clear on what this would be used for. It's too thick and gooey to blend nicely. I tried it under my eyes, and it would not blend without glopping in to under-eye lines. I tried it just on red spots under foundation, and it was too noticeable. I'm very fair skinned, brunette, and with "combination" skin. This didn't  make me break out, which was a plus, but it also didn't work as well as the regular cover stick method. If you had just a few spots, you could probably blend this out like a foundation to hide them, with some powder to "fix". It seems geared to a very young woman without lines or dry patches.
So I really love the color and the product!! The only downfall is that it doesn’t last all last long (which I think is part of longevity), because there just isn’t enough product is what I mean. I guess I expected that (why I gave it the 1 less star) but I get bummed having to rebuy it so maybe I will look for a full coverage product of theirs that comes in a larger size like for foundation. But I love the coverage and the wear. I will buy again though for sure.
I love this brand and I always buy it, it’s lightweight, and as long as I know my shade it looks great. It lasts me all day and i’ve never had a bad experience with this brand. I will be buying again!
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! This is the first concealer I've found that doesn't dry my face out and doesn't cake. I use a beauty blender to blend it in and that works great! Definitely covers everything I need it to.Will definitely be buying this again and again!
My favorite concealer
Wow,  I love this stuff.  What a surprise.  I've avoided all Maybelline products for years because I react badly to their eye makeup.  But I tried this because it was so highly recommended.  No bad reaction.  It looks like it's going to be too dark at first but it blends in perfectly.  It looks smooth and doesn't accentuate your wrinkles like most concealers.  A little goes a long way so you don't need much.  It will migrate into lines if you don't set it with a little bit of powder.  That's fine with me.  I really love the way it looks and I've tried tons of different ones,  most of them way more expensive.
Maybelline makeup works better than brands that cost triple the price.  The color!assortment is good.  The cost is great.  The quality can’t be beat.
🥰
I LOVED this product! I'm fairly pale and I was worried I would get too light or too dark, but it wasn't! I will definitely be purchasing this product again! It shipped fairly fast as well!
It’s so good I’m in love
I haven't had it very long so I don't know how much product is there, but I do know I like the product.  It creases much less than other concealers I've used and the color is true to what you see on screen.
Fit Me concealer is very light and easy to blend- it's often considered a dupe for Nars radiant creamy concealer. I'm fair-skinned and I have very strong yellow undertones so this can look a bit orange on me, but it works beautifully when I'm tanner in the summer. It does crease on my under eyes so I need a translucent powder to set it. The coverage is good, not mind-blowing, but covers up under eyes and pimples fairly well. I do need a color corrector if my dark circles or acne is particularly bad.
Very , very easy to use , the thickness was perfect, the coverage was amazing ,was very happy with coverage ,use this under my eyes and was very very impressed,will buy again !
One of my favorite makeup youtubers suggested this as a great drugstore concealer.  I bought it , used it and fell in love. I then bought it two more times after my first purchase with Amazon. You can actually build on this product for more coverage under your eyes without it becoming cakey and it is easy to blend out with a beauty blender. Being a WOC (women of color) and this product being a drugstore, it is usually hard to find concealers that match or can be used for a highlight, this product on the other hand, didn't look ashy and was not too light to use as a highlight under my eyes.
This works perfectly with fit me make up. It is so easy to blend in. It dose not crease or crack. Stays in place all day. This is my favorite concealer to use for a highlight.
Favorite!
I wanted to like this concealer but I just didn’t. I’m sure it’s a good concealer for a lot of women and it definitely got many great reviews but I was disappointed.  I’m sure I’ll find one that works well on my skin.
I bought this after seeing it used in a make up YouTube video, I use it when I want to do highlight and contour. Or if I have a blemish. I don't realy recommend using this daily on top of foundation because it is heavy and for me would cause breakouts if used often. But when I want to go out and do full make up, it work very well. The color matched me when I bought it, but after tanning it seems a bit to light. I will save it for fall/winter make up when I pale up again!
I like this concealer The only problem with it is I had to add two coats because I have Dark spots that I'm trying to conceal and it does work very well
This has been one of my favorite concealers so far. It is easy to blend, does not crease as much as others (I have fine lines in my eye area). I use a sponge to blend this in and it works very well with either a wet sponge or a completely dry one (for more coverage). I've tried blending it with my fingers too but I found it creases a little bit more than with my real techniques sponges I use.I highly recommend using this in either young skin or more mature skin (my mom uses it too and she looks flawless).
I was excited to receive this product because of the rave it got on makeup review sites. I got #15 fair and it is a little bit too pink undertone for me. To cover red zits, I don't want a pink toned concealer - it just makes it more pink and not necessarily similar to my skin color. If it were more yellow, it would be easier to blend and hide blemishes and dark circles. However, it does cover up these things very well. I do not have to reapply it throughout the day or 2 minutes after I put foundation on top of it. I am pleased with the coverage. I may repurchase this product.
I have been using this concealer for years now, and every time I try something new, I always gravitate back towards this one! I am an nc20, and purchased the shade Sand, which is the perfect color match for me. I use this for concealing blemishes, hyperpigmentation, priming my eyelids, and underneath my eyes. It is a thin consistency, that is buildable. So it is perfect for no makeup, makeup days. I also love the Maybelline Better Skin concealer, but they don't have as good of a shade range. The Fit Me will always be my go to!
Since the question of presentation came up , yes it could be a little better looking and the wand portion is cheezy. I don't like this kind of applicator. With that in mind, this is my perfect shade of skin. This is exactly my color. I bought this online to try and see and it worked out wonderfully. I would like to find this shade in a foundation. Please let me know if there is!
I've been using this Maybelline concelour for quite some time now and I was happy that I found it on Amazon for a cheap price. However when I started using it, I had really dark under tones, which I don't have and I can immediately tell that this isn't the same formula that I have been buying before. It's still the similar constincey but it's not as good as the real thing. Instead of brightening my face, it darkened it. Presentation looks the same.
THE CONCEALER IS GREAT
Great concealer - it's not too heavy, but not so thin that it doesn't give good single-layer coverage. The 10 Light color is a little bit warm-based - I've read that the 15 Fair is more of a cool undertone, so I'm going to try that, too. I have a weird splotchy complexion that's pink in some areas and a little warm/neutral in others; this is perfect for the warmer areas. It covers blemishes wonderfully, and stays put during the day, especially with a setting/finishing spray. It doesn't irritate my cranky, sensitive, zit-prone, 40-year old skin, and doesn't look crusty or chalky.
This concealer works great, i love it. I was a bit weary that it would be too light for my skin tone but it’s perfect!
If you’re looking for a medium coverage hydrating concealer this one is perfect. Looks extremely natural and doesn’t cling to any dry patches. Only complaint is when I re ordered it again on amazon the shades seem different. Re purchase did not match my skin color at all.. not sure what’s up with that.
Small, sleek and ready to go anywhere. #10 fair Clair was the perfect blend in Maybelline New York's 'FIT me!! Line. Has a velvet applicator for an opaque coating. Soft hint of pleasant fragrance and a light airy feel make this an instant go to in my makeup bag or to toss in the purse for quick touchups.
usually the concealers i get are way too light for my skin but this one was more decent than those. there was no issue
I bought the "Light" shade as recommended by the product description to compliment my Classic Ivory foundation and the concealer is very very close to being the same shade as the foundation. I thought it was actually darker than the foundation at first... I would have bought Vanilla, but it was not available and it looks like it would be much lighter than "Light". It's a good concealer, I just want more shades.
Great coverage amazing price!
Easy to use and gods under eye puffy ness
I ordered medium 25. I m nc 30-35 & w3 or w4 in loreal true match and Maybelline fit me Matt and poreless mix of 220 & 120. Medium 25 is my perfect match which is what I wanted to conceal dark circles. Works OK to hide dark circles but not puffiness. Also  doesn't last long. Disappeared after 2 hours specially if u r oily. But hides dark circles relatively well. Will purchase again.
BEST concealer. It’s so creamy and a great dupe for high end concealers. It feels really moisturizing and doesn't clump or crease. It works best if you use your ring finger to apply it or a mini beauty blender! I love this concealer and have been using it for like 5 years and would never change!
Thank you
I had high hopes for this concealer.  I will not be buying it again once it runs out.  It did not cover some dark spots on my cheeks as I would have wanted to.  I also noticed that it settled into some lines.I have already found a replacement: Maybelline Instant Rewind Age Multi-Use Concealer, Medium to Full Coverage.
I purchased this for a cheaper option for a summer concealer. The color was perfect! Will buy again!
I've heard how great this line is for years, but have never gotten around to try it out. I was previously using a concealer from another brand that I loved, but it was discontinued so I thought I'd try it out. I know that in the past Maybelline was known for its eye makeup but most of the face products they released were gimmicky and didn't stick around. This is definitely a quality, usable makeup. It blends really well and doesn't settle in to my wrinkles. I'm not that old and don't have deep wrinkles, but some drug store concealers really target those fine lines! This product is a winner if you're looking for an affordable concealer.
Very thick hard to applyDisappointed expected more based on great reviews.Very little product in tubesDidn't pay much but it was a real waste of money. Hate having to just throw it outOnly option for was to have another tube sent?
I've been pretty pleased with Maybelline products so far considering its a larger brand. Prices are great and the product works as it should. No complaints. With that said I'm new to makeup. Still lots to learn.
Okay. I am not an expert when it comes to make up. I barely wear make up but fell in love with the whole “on-fleek” eyebrow make up that many women out there are sporting on. I being a novice manage to create the look with this concealer. The concealer is just right with my skin tone.(I’m very pale)Overall, I like how the product is light weight on my skin and it blends in just right.
Color was fine but it cakes and settles into creases.I couldn’t find any of the No 7 I was using in Thailand. It was perfect. The search continues. This is going in the trash.
Been using this for months and have been completely satisfied. It’s got good coverage and have had no issues with it last the whole time. Its the first time I’ve ordered it online though. I ordered it less than a day and a half ago and it arrived last night. Super shocked but super happy.
I have used several concealers and this one rates high for coverage.
This concealer is amazing! It does everything a concealer should do, and for the price, you can't beat it. It's so light weight, it barely looks like you're wearing anything and yet it covers so well. I have a lot of redness around my nose and on my eyes and it covered all of that right up for me! I also got a small scratch on my chin from my dog and it covered that right up too! I can't say how good it is for acne because I don't have that problem but I image it would do very well. I would have provided pictures to support this but my camera is very poor.
I love the Fit Me! foundation so I decided to try the concealer as well. I'm not AS crazy about this part of the line. The color is much lighter than pictured. I bought 15 Fair and it's very, VERY light - almost ivory with very little of the brown tones in the photo. It's very thick and opaque so it offers a lot of coverage. But be careful how much you apply. If you slap this on like other thinner concealers, you'll be blending for a long time.
Delivery took almost 2 weeks and the product was NOT sealed and used used!!!!!
Wish I could have more product in this bottle. I have a bunch of wrinkles under my eye and need A LOT of coverage and this one bottle is NOT enough. I subscribed to to this bottle to get it every 2 months but it seems like I'll need it every month!!!! The coverage is great but that's only if I use the whole fricken bottle on ONE makeup session 🙄 I really like the applicator it comes with and its best to blend with a beauty sponge or tips of fingers. concealer doesn't move throughout the day once you set it. Reason for the 3 star is the fact that I only used it twice and it's already gone because I have to use so much product !! For the price it's not too bad a bit expensive especially with how much you're getting.
I love this concealer! I normally purchase this at Walmart but this is nicer and the price margin is better! It has lasted me a while and I’m definitely going to purchase it again.
I’ve been using this product for years now, and it’s treated me well all this time. I’m a very low maintenance makeup wearer, I do moisturizer, spf, and then use this product wherever I have some redness and under my eyes. It’s super lightweight with plenty of coverage, I have oily, acne prone skin and it’s never caused me to break out.
Ladies, I am a dark color woman and I bought a sand color end up wayyyyy! To dark...so try another brighter color than what you think
I wasn’t sure what shade I would be, but u have skin that is a bit light, so I chose fair. It matches my skin very well and works great!
Right color, right consistency to cover dark circles under the eyes and to tone down red skin on nose that got overexposed to the sun.
Covers dark circles
I love the coverage it glides on smoothly and blends into the skin easily. I am 42 and I have some lines on my eyes and it doesn't crease it looks nice
This product is okay for the money. For sure. I just needed to return it because I ordered Some expensive make up that I’m told will work better for my skin I need full coverage this does cover but it’s very light, it’s very hard for me to find a make up that fits my skin other than that this product would be OK the seller refunded me and let me keep the concealer I am just going to regift it to someone who may use it
I’ve tried many concealers over the years and this is my favorite.  It was recommended to me from a professional makeup artist.  It’s sheer, moisturizing, and very easy to blend.  Aaaaand it’s very affordable.
I use this product for my under-eye area. The color of this concealer works so well for me. I'm quite fair and sometimes have a hard time finding makeup for my skin. Thankfully, this matches my light coloring and also helps me to look more "awake!" I'm almost 30 and have a sweet toddler who keeps me on my toes. I'm so lucky to have her! But I do look more tired these days, and blending a small amount of this concealer uner my eyes seems to wake up my whole face. I should have tried this product before....any time I'd look in the mirror I felt that I looked tired and run-down. Now I look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed again! ;)
Love these concealers.
This stuff is amazing. I'm 28 years old and I have NEVER found a concealer that worked for me. And believe me, I've looked. No shade match. Too heavy coverage. Too light coverage. Almost every one ended up looking uneven or chalky on my dry, sensitive skin.This concealer has the perfect consistency and coverage. It applies like a dream - blends smoothly AND stays put for hours. Although the product has enough coverage to hide dark circles, it doesn't feel heavy on your face. The only flaw I could think of is the packaging; it applies with a wand (similar to lip gloss) which I don't care for, but for under 5 bucks this concealer is an absolute steal.
I have been using this concealer for years and I love it for spot concealing (I don’t use any under eye concealer as it all looks too heavy on me). Works great with and without any base makeup! Super natural and amazon is the best deal if you already know your shade
This product is great. You can build it up easily and its nice and creamy. Its also great for cleaning up your eyebrows. I will definitely buy again.
Its a small bottle, but it works perfectly! Love it! Definitely recommend!❤❤ I have very light skin, and I got ivory. (wich is the Lightest color).
Perfect color. I like the chart that tells you which color to buy based on what fitme foundation you own
I haven't opened it because i may send it back.  I can confirm the other reviewer who posted a photo that this really isn't light.  I guess I needed "fair".  I thought fair would be too light because I have olive undertones......
Very good
This is my all time favorite everyday concealer. Super easy to apply whether you want to apply it with your fingers or a beauty blender. Very comfortable and has great coverage. Definitely would recommend and it totally worth the money!
Don't wear makeup at all. I thought I would try something new. It matched my skin color online and also when I received it but putting it on felt coloring my face with a crayon. I don't know if I felt it would match accurate or what but it wasn't for me.
Love these concealers.

Good
I have skin that will break out if you look at it the wrong way, but this stuff is not a problem for me. My esthetician that specializes in acne treatment recommends this as one of the few products that legitimately has no pore clogging ingredients.  I put this on my red spots and dab with a beauty blender, then apply some light mineral makeup. Does a great job for me of reducing redness without looking super caked-on. I am pretty pale and use 10 Light. I hope they never change the ingredients!
I don’t sleep very good and get light brown circles under my eyes and the concealer really helps in covering it.
I was using a designer concealer for years.  This is my second ever low price concealer.  Love it.  Why spend so much when you can have similar quality paying less
I love it so much!! The only thing i don’t like about it is that it ran out quickly, but that could also just be bc of me
It’s okay. Make sure you get the right color for your skin. Not sure I would buy it again.
If I lost all of my makeup and could only buy one product, it would be this. I have some of the worst dark circles and very fair skin, so concealer is essential. I'm not saying this completely covers my super dark circles, but when I use this over an orange corrector, I actually look awake and healthy. This is the one concealer I've found that actually looks like skin.Remember that #15 Fair is lighter and more pinkish than #10 Light, which is deeper and more golden. I'm an NW20-25 and use #15 in the winter and #10 in the summer. I have a drawer full of concealer and this is the best.
Here are some photos with and without flash. I have pretty deep eye sockets so it's hard to conceal but this does a pretty good job! The finish is very natural- I do wish it had slightly more coverage. Didn't really blow me out of the water and don't think it lives up to the hype for me, personally.
This concealer is perfect. It does the job well. It helped conceal my hard to cover brown spots under my eyes and facial redness.
My favorite concelear I will keep repurchasing it. Does not look cake and gives great coverage. I highly recommend
The color is too yellow. It's supposed to go well with my skin tone but the color is more of a custard tone. It works better for those with warm undertones
I really enjoy this concealer. It is thin and easy to apply. Just keep in mind it isn't amazing at covering dark circles, but I purchased this to eliminate the annoying wrinkles I always get under my eyes from every concealer. Though it doesn't completely eliminate the wrinkles, it does a good job and I would probably buy it again if I am looking for a low-cost concealer.
Good product matched well with my skin, maybe a little too oil for me in the sun.
It has pretty good coverage, but the lightest shade they had was still slightly too dark for me. I can definitely make it work though. It does however crease a lot, and will make my wrinkles more prominent even with setting powder. I'm only 20, so I dont have many wrinkles to begin with. For the price I suppose I can't really complain. I'll use it till it's gone, but won't be purchasing again.
was nice and matched for me pretty good
Must have item. Affordable and works great. May need to put a lot to cover stuffs on the face or something but it works so that matter most to me.
I decided to go with Maybelline instead of MAC this time and honestly it does the same job as the more expensive brand. I'll order again! The color was good on my fairer completion too.
Lighter than other brands with that same color name, and I’m not tanned at all.  Can’t use it.
I like this overall. The color isn’t as light as I thought. Also the applicator is very small and not as big as I would like. For the price, great deal overall!
First time using this concealer and I love it. Matches my shade perfectly as I’m very pale so hard to find. Great coverage!
This was exactly what I was looking for , for my raccoon eyes! It’s covers all of my dark circles up! Highly recommend this
I love this concealer. It blends well with my foundation and powder. It gives you that matte flawless look.
I Bought it to cover dark circles under eyes but it didn’t work
Good
Not thick or cakie!! Even covers my psoriasis!!
It might just be me, but this stuff has a bad reaction with my eyes.
This product does its job well; it’s great for hiding blemishes and dark circles under the eyes. It doesn’t cake and lasts for a fairly long time.
Product has great ease of use and smoothness when applied. The products ability to blend is helpful when applied to friends I do makeovers on.
Did do a thing for me. No difference at all.  Doesn't cover dark circles.
I've waited a few weeks to write this review, so I could really try this product out.  I bought the lightest color available and it still seems slightly dark for my skintone.  I am not overly pale either. The concealer almost has an orange tint to it, which I am not fond of.  The coverage is decent, but I definitely prefer my MAC concealer over this.  I am a bit disappointed, because I read so many great reviews about this and I found it to be just average.  Don't get me wrong, it is a pretty good drugstore concealer, but I don't really think it adds up to all of the hype surrounding it.  The coverage was decent and the consistency was nice-  not too thick and not too thin.  Overall, it was okay, but I probably will not re-purchase after I use this up.
This concealer is just kind of okay. As in, I used the whole (super tiny!!) tube and it covered some blemishes but not ideal for under eyes and the applicator is very thin, as is the formula. Not impressed and definitely won't be repurchasing. There are way better concealers for just as inexpensive!
Normally get it at Walmart but they stopped carrying it. Started using this product a few years back, still love it as an everyday concealer. Will stick to amazon from now on!
Meh. It's okay. It works well in certain areas of the face. I used it under my eyes and it didn't really do much. I wouldn't buy it again.
This product is so thin I have to double up on application when I use it. This is the thinnest computer I've ever used in my life. Maybe one can use it to outline their cut crease or two out liner cut crease and then wipe it off but this is not a good under eye concealer in my opinion. I've use cheaper concealers that do more for me and my clients.
I have use this over so many different foundations and it has consistently been the best highlighter. I have used it over smashbox Studio skin (3.1 ish range), Armani luminous silk (8 &9), too faced born this way (caramel), supergoop cc cream (dark). I used to use fit me #20 but now I find #25 to be a better, more natural fit. #20 was a little more dramatic. To bake, I use the RCMA no color powder, which makes it look really smooth and flawless.
it was smaller than i expected. and it works ok, but it wasnt like "woah this is great".
I love this concealer. It's not too heavy, very light but still creamy enough to conceal. Using it and the maybelline foundation really works well together.
It works pretty well. The color is a little too "pink-ish" for my complexion which is fair but w/more yellow/orange tones. I bought it because the product I usually use isn't available right now. It's also in a smaller container than the product I normally use, but costs less, so the price probably comes out at about the same. Don't know yet how often I'll have to replace it.
It covers my dark spot okay-ish because it is not a full coverage concealer.
So far this is my favorite concealer - although I will still continue to look for the perfect one for me.  I love high end products, however I've just bought way too many concealers that didn't deliver.  This one is very good especially considering it's only about $5.  Can't beat if for the price.  It's certainly better than the similar NYX product
To be honest, I’m lil obssessed with make up, so I own lots lots lots of make up products and never get to use anything up.This is one of the make up products from my collection that I ran out and had to purchase again.This is the best concealer ever!!It covers really well, but still not too heavy on your skin.My make up is not complete without this Fit Me Concealer, just love it so much!
Great every day concealer for the price. Goes on smooth, good coverage. You don’t get a lot, but it’s not expensive. I’ve purchased this a few times now and still happy.
It’s doable!
Very good but it kinda makes my skin burn so I dont rlly use it much
I usually buy this from Walgreens but it’s actually like $3-5 cheaper on amazon so this is where I will continue to purchase it. I have acne prone skin and for the most part it covers up my blemishes pretty well. Overall I really like this product and I love the price point even more!
It is much darker than the last time I purchased it. It is also much thicker and harder to spread or blend in with base. It falls into every tiny line around my eyes and seems to "cake" up and crack throughout the day. I have never had an under eye concealer this awful before.
I always buy fit me foundation so I thought I’d give the concealer a shot and it was amazing! It holds all day with no problem. I love it. Blends easy, stays on forever! I would 10/10 recommend!
I got 15 Light and it’s more for darker color skin. I’m pale skinned and it looks orange on me
It was a good price, but it was runny and too sheer.  Bot enough coverage.
I have been paying $30 every few months for NARS radiant cream concealer because I thought it was the best. But I bought this for like $5 and can’t tell a difference. Same quality as “high end” makeup for 1/6 of the price.
Good value for the money. Does its job bery good. Reordered many times. My go to concealer so far.
I love this for a “drugstore” concealer. I’ve used it for years and will occasionally buy an expensive concealer and I have no complaints or problems transitioning back to this one time and time again. It’s easy to apply, blends nicely and seems to last forever.
I tried this product on for the first time this morning and boy did it wake me up.  Not in a good way.  After washing my face, applying face serum, moisturizer, and then primer, I applied this product in an upside down triangle under my eyes.  It burned like Satan's balls.  Oh my lord, I jumped up and down and ran around the bathroom.  I think I was unconsciously running from the pain.  After a while the burning subsided.  Oh and the color is just too damn light but I have to say it is highly pigmented.  I'm pretty sure the area below the concealer application is a valley of red anger, but you cant see it because the concealer does it's job so well..
I'm disappointed in this product. My skin has been breaking out and I thought this product would help with that. It didn't do it's job to conceal until I over applied with product. I don't feel comfortable doing that because I know it would make the acne worse and take longer to clear up.
I’m not used to this type of concealer, so it took me a bit to figure out how to use it effectively. It’s far too dark for my skin tone, but dabbing away excess and using another (much lighter) lipstick-style concealer produced a very good effect. If there were a lighter color it might work better on its own.
I like the Fit Me! Line from Maybelline, however this concealer was not my favorite. I like medium to full coverage concealer and this is light to medium coverage in my opinion. I didn't have any issues with blending this. I love how this comes in a huge shade range!
Really excellent drugstore brand. Blends very well and provides full coverage, comparable (but not identical) to NARS creamy concealer. Apply to one eye at a time and blend with a beauty blender because it does begin to dry and set fairly quickly and by the time you get to the other eye, the product will have set itself. Does oxidize a BIT but I have found using a lighter shade or one with cool undertones instead of warm minimizes how obvious that is.
I can never find this in stores any more. So I ordered it here and found that it was actually the low of a price. Got the subscription for it and been happy since. Life saver really
This is my holy grail concealer for my dark under eyes. I have genetic under eye circles; they aren't caused by being tired, I just have thinner skin so the blood vessels are more visible causing darkness. I've tried benefit erase paste, smashbox cc cream, it cosmetics bye-bye undereye, nars concealer, and tons of drugstore brands. This one is the best of them all, and its so much more affordable. I apply it first with the provided wand, and then dab it in with a mini beauty blender before setting it with translucent powder. This is the best coverage I've ever found. Buy this!
The color is perfect and the sheer essence is great! Blends well with my foundation. This product is moisturizing because it doesn't dry out my skin
When I tried it on I was in shock. My face just brightened up from before and it hid my dark circles really well which is crazy since I’m always tired. My first thought was just, “Woah, magic.” I would definitely recommend! :)
Great coverage!! Just what I needed!
I dont wear alot of makeup ..this covered the spots I needed covered and is long lasting.
Easy to use.
good product have always liked it but no safety seal on the tube it’s self so kinda risky 👀
I recieved one with the safety seal broken and it looked like it was a sample tester! So I requested a replacement and was sent a new one!! It works good!!
This Concealer is great! I have purchased fair (#15) and light (#10) and although light has a lower number, fair is definitely lighter in color. I am a very pale (always burn in the summer) scandi-canadian and the light is a dead ringer for my skin tone. I use the fair as a highlight. The product is thick enough to cover blemishes and blends easily with a beauty blender. I also find it's great for baking the face. I'm not as much of a fan of their fit me foundation, but I'll definitely be buying their concealer again and again.
Got for mid to full to light depending how you use it I would definitely recommend
My new favorite concealer hides blemishes great perfect shade great price
Loved the smoothness of how it glides on. Covered my dark circles @ it was a perfect match to my skin tone.
I ordered the color "light" and I have OLIVE-toned skin with a tendency toward oiliness.I'm new to using concealer for my under eye circles so I don't have much to compare this to.  It seems to work on lightening my dark areas with decent pigmentation but it does settle into fine lines a bit and it doesn't stay in place as much as I'd like it to.  I'm giving it 3 stars based on reasonable price, good pigmentation, color accuracy for my olive toned skin and the fact that this smells fine (no strong, obnoxious odor).Overall I wish it had better staying power and didn't settle into my fine lines.  I'll continue using this brand until I find a better alternative.
I don't think this concealer really covers enough to be considered a true concealer as it's very light and sheer almost like a bb cream. It's also very drying for a liquid. The skin under your eyes is so delicate that the last thing you want is for it to become dry. This product would probably do well on greasy oily skin, but it's not so good for normal/dry.
Ordered this two days ago for my bags under my eyes and a few blemishes, it is awesome! Especially for the price. Love it and can’t wait to do my full face of make up after applying it. 10/10!
Affordable and pretty good
It’s alright. Not much coverage for a concealer in my opinion. Not bad though!
This is a great concealer to have. I ordered the honey shade, and I am African-American with a medium-brown complexion. It really lightens up my eyes and helps to hide my scars. To top it all off, it is really affordable. Definitely recommend!
I already had the fit me foundation so I bought the concealer as well and these are my new favorites!!
For this color to be 35 deep it is pretty light. It is lighter than 30 Cafe which should not be the case. Deep should be darker but it's not. But this is okay. I bought it to highlight underneath my eyes anyway so I will definitely make it work. But I think that Deep being way lighter than the color Cafe is just a manufacturer problem by Maybelline and maybe they need to reformulate it to make it darker. But the concealer over all is pretty good. It does not crease on me but everyone is different. I just wanted to review this for my darker skinned ladies. This lighter than expected so be cautious and maybe pick up 30 cafe
I am more than happy with this concealer and I'm a man. It looks great on my skin and blends very nicely. I know some are going to say men shouldn't wear makeup, but when your gay like me you got to look perfect for that man!
For the Fit Me concealers, this is their lightest color. I'm very fair, yellow undertone (NC15) and this concealer is too dark. It's still usable thought because of the yellow undertones to cancel out under eye blueness, but I need to blend with foundation color. After work touch up sometimes needed, gets bit cakey at the end of the day. I also ordered a NYX concealer which was a much better color match, bit lighter consistency.
Love this concealer. It does crease after time tho. I do set/bake ...but still some creasing noted. Overall amazing for the price.
It was darker than I expected, but rather than waste it, I decided to use it to do some slight contouring in the darker, more hollow parts of my face, and used a lighter concealer from a different line (the Maybelline master conceal) to highlight. It actually worked well, and since I'm almost out of it now, I'm thinking about getting a new one, but I'm leaning towards using a slightly darker one from the Maybelline Master Conceal line instead. However, I'd prefer a slightly darker concealer with cooler tones to match my skin better. I'm also debating whether it's worth it or not. We'll see.
Great application.Good coverage.Great match.
I usually mix this with my moisturizing gel to create a thin coverage over my face. When used in this way, the concealer works great! If I don't dilute it, I find that it is a bit heavy on my skin, and settles into some of my creases over the course of the day. However, I love how this product is affordable, and does not irritate or stimulate my acne-prone skin. Would repurchase!
Im 65 and there aren't a whole lot of products that can be used on mature skin, Love this.
I have used this concealer for years. It matches my skin tone and has nice coverage
This product provides light coverage.  It has a nice texture; however, if you need more complete coverage there may be better options out there.
PLEASE DONT BUY HERETRY TO GO BUY IN PERSON. THIS CAME OPEN AND BROKENIt wont close
I've used this product once so far and I liked the texture of the creaminess. I ordered "Fair". It was surprisingly exactly my skin color, which is a good and bad thing. I was hoping for a little bit lighter for a stronger coverage. I do prefer NYX's concealer Prof. Makeup HD Concealer in "Fair". Overall a better product than this one, in my opinion.
Great concealer and not to thick! Does not settle in fine lines and will most definitely purchase again. Easy to blend and does not cake on top of your foundation!
It has a texture consistent enough to cover the dark circles and at the same time it is thin and soft to don't create a mask effect on the face.You do not need a large quantity, so the content of the bottle is enough for a long period of time. It is perfect to take you on a trip since it does not take up a large space
i really really really liked this concealer ! of all the concealers i’ve used this was definitely my favorite.
I'm a loyal fitme concealer consumer but apparently every girl in my area happens to also use the same shade, selling out at every store right now. So I'm just hyped I was able to get it via Amazon.
My favorite concealer. Very good both under eyes and on blemishes or acne scars. Not drying or irritating for dry and sensitive skin. Doesn't seem to cause me acne. It's the easiest and smoothest formula of concealer I've worked with and despite the "fair" color being a pink undertone and therefore not a perfect match for my yellow toned super light porcelain skin-it blends right in and doesn't seem to be noticeable. I would highly recommend this concealer for everyone to try but I don't if those that are quite oily will enjoy this or if it will have that great of lasting power on pretty oily skin.
I love this concealer. I have tried a lot in the past and some a lot more expensive than this one that didn't give me nearly as good coverage. For the price point this is a great all round concealer. It was a little lighter than I expected but it works just fine at concealing the bags under my eyes and also any blemishes on my skin. It also blends really well and doesn't cake at all. I love this concealer!
It gives you a matte result and it takes away those bags under your eyes. I should have gotten a lighter tone but I guess this one will be okay. Smells weird, like acrylic paint or something but I like besides that
i love this concealer, No oils, no waxes, no nonsense. very natural coverage that leaves my skin very fresh, breathing, natural. Blends seamlessly to cover under-eye circles & imperfections,This is a very light concealer that does not cake up at all.I find that it is very pigmented and that a little bit of product  goes a long way, so you never need to use too much at once.This is the best concealer I have found so far for covering my under eyes that doesn't crease too much. in conclusion this concealer for me is perfect, and the price is fantastic
I love this concealer for my under eyes, works great. And is such a good price.
Very smooth and to apply!
The lightest color is extra light if that’s what you are going for. I’m a pale redhead, but it’s a bit light even for me. It’s a very thick concealer, so it works well to cover a blemish, but this looks terrible and cakey under eyes, so I have to use a different under eye concealer which is annoying. I try to keep my necessary products to a minimum to streamline getting ready in the morning, so I want a concealer that multitasks.
Goes on easily so no tugging on delicate eye area.  I use moisturizer under my makeup but this concealer is moisturizing alone too.
Very nice product. Matched my shin tone nicely. Very light and easy to blend.
I think I'm on my 4th tube of this. I really like it. It works well for me. It is not cakey, as long as you are using a moisturizer or primer that mixes well with this consistency of this product. I don't fully understand, but if products are oil based or water based or have a thicker or creamier base, it might mix differently. I would describe it as medium coverage. Its full coverage before its blended out.
Ok my wife does have fine lines.  They are really under her eyes.  This color was alright but it caked up and really settled and caked in those lines. She went by the directions. Perhaps others can work with it better than my wife. No go for her.
Ok. Didnt do to much for me
Pretty good concealer. Takes a bit to blend. Overall satisfied
Great little concealer! For the price it can't be beat! I don't have much acne, but I have bunch of scars and this does a great job of covering them up. It's not the longest lasting concealer, but since I work outside in the sun all day, any concealer has a hard time surviving through the sweat and grime. Despite that, it holds up great during normal, non-sweaty wear.
I'm really pleased with this. Luckily, I picked the right shade. It's easy to apply, it stays on, and it doesn't crust or flake. A fabulous product.
The medium shade matched me PERFECTLY. Idk how well it really covers dark spots..im curious to try it with an orange color corrector. My only complaint is it seems to not have much product in the tube! I will definitely have to use sparingly so as not to quickly run out
Love this concealer but I have troubles with almost all concealers creasing on me and this one is no different.  Since I discovered the Tarte Shape Tape I haven't gone back to this one but still think it's an excellent choice for most people who don't have as oily of skin.
Color match is fantastic! Feels great to use. I only wish I’d found it sooner!

I absolutely love this concealer although for some reason it burns when i leave it in the crease of my nose before blending it. The formula blends so well though and it actually has coverage unlike some drugstore brands. Now when the package came in i noticed the color had a pink undertone to it so i checked which shade was sent and of course it was the wrong shade. I ordered "sand" but got sent something different, was going to return it but it matched my moms skin perfectly so she got a free concealer!
Used it for years. Go to standby
Easy to blend and good color match.
This concealer works well at a fair price, but it does not last day.
It doesn’t even cover anything and poor texture
Perfect.
Go well with my skin, definitely buying again.
Just a lovely cover stick.Would not want to be with out it.
I have yet to find a better drugstore concealer.  It's odd -- when I apply it first to my fresh skin, it appears VERY dark.  I turn orange everywhere I apply it.  After I put on my foundation/bronzer/blush/powder (which, I might add DOES NOT make my face much darker at all), it appears very light.  I guess this means it just blends well with other makeup.  It covers very well.  Thick, yet doesn't cause breakouts.  Doesn't have a scent.  Easy to apply.  Lasts forever.  I recommend.
I got two instead of one. I'm not complaining though.
I use this as a contour. It blends well and adds a nice subtle bronze color. The wand also makes application easy. Would recommend to anyone looking for a nice drugstore concealer.
Too pasty
it was smaller than i expected but works really well an it matches right with my skin color, light enough that it will cover up whatever but not too light where i would look dead. It is easy to blend and its very smooth on the skin. I would totally recommend!
I wanted to see how concealer would change my look without spending too much money. This definitely did the job and it looked great. You need setting powder or non-oily skin for this to stay though.
I don't like it at all. The ivory shade is white like the wall. The concealer doesn't stay put on  my pimples. Pure crap
I saw a lot of reviews about this concealer on here and YouTube before ordering it and it is every bit as good as people are raving about. I have some pretty dark circles and this comes darn close to making them vanish, and that says a lot believe me, as well as not settling into those fine lines I'm starting to get. Super glad I took a chance on this one guys.Oh p.s.I got the medium even though it was not my skin tone because it has an orange tint to it...which is best for dark circles..... and it still blends seamlessly under my foundation without budging.
great coverage.  even better price.
This is one of the better concealers I’ve tried. I really like this one and will continue to purchase it in the future.
Best concealer EVER!!! It’s creamy and gives off a natural finish
I like the formula and I do use this but only because I am so fair with olive undertones that until I can afford to get my products custom blended this will have to do. The texture, coverage, and blendabilility are nice. It's just too dark and I have to then blend a foundation into my neck and to get an even tone.
I really liked it ! It’s light but dosent make your face too Cakey:)!😫
This is a great Wednesday all or you just have to use this a little bit more than you normally would. But is very good for the skin. You don't have to worry it because it is hypoallergenic.
I have always had dark circles under my eyes and this helps but does not fully cover them. It actually does make the area under my eyes a bit shiny or greasy sometimes if I use too much. I will probably keep using as it is better than others I have tried and does help!
My favorite concealer! I've purchase this in sand and fair and love them both. Sand is a little darker in more yellow based than fair. They are both great for different reasons. I tend to use the fair around my eyes and the sand around my nose, between my eyes, and on acne since it matches my skin better. The fair is great for illuminating areas without being obviously shiny like an illuminator tends to do. I've tried many top brands at Sephora and this is still my favorite for the price!
I had a problem finding the right shade this is the right shade it’s just very thin does not cover up very well
This is a good concealer. Not as nice as some of the high-end brands, but for the price, definitely worth it.
I have dark circles that I have tried so many concealers on.  My favorite is Amazing Cosmetics concealer but it costs $40.  It lasts a very long time due to using very little, but still rather expensive.  I saw a youtube video raving about this concealer and thought I would try it.  I was very impressed!  It works well and does not crease, stays on all day, and it easy to apply.  I apply it with a brush and blend it with a moist sponge for a perfect finish.  It is very inexpensive and works like a charm!  If you are pale skinned, go with the Fair color.  Nice product!
This stuff is really great concealer for dark circles and blemishes and at a great price! Definitely will buy again.
I first got it and said omg that’s really really orange  just on my hand. After I got done with my makeup I looked again after it dried and I looked orange and a completely different skin tone so my neck. Idk if it’s my skin tone or if this proudct. Also barely had any in the bottle…?
This product doesn’t last long but it looks natural and feet on the skin. Would recommend if you were a beginner.
Silky application.  Not thick and clumpy.  Glides on nicely and easy to blend.
This concealer color matches my skin tone pretty well. For $4.50 its a good deal and good quality makeup.
when i opened the package the concealer came used and it didn’t even come in a package it just came with the concealer it’s self.
It wasn't too heavy under and around my eyes, the tone was perfect,  it moisturizes and looks natural. I put a light brushing of translucent powder over my whole face and it stays looking fresh all day.
I decided to use this because I loved the Fit Me foundation on my oily skin. It works great for concealing and highlighting. It blends without problem with a wet sponge (I use Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge).This is the makeup routine that works for me:1. Moisturizer.2. Primer.3. Foundation.4. Fit Me! Concealer (I apply it under my eyes, on my forehead and nose).5. Translucent powder.6. Setting Spray.
Would probably Jude buy more authentic and non expired in stores..
Nice color
Ordered two shades, can’t use either. Ridiculously golden and orange, oxidized to an awful consistency. I’m a regular Instant Age Rewind user and figured I’d try these but they’re awful
It's very difficult to find affordable concealers that are both yellow in undertone and creamy enough to blend. This checks off both boxes. It settles a tiny bit into lines, but a few bops with a sponge and some powder takes care of that.On top of foundation it has considerable lasting power. I have extremely oily skin and as long as this is set well, it lasts a full work day.
I love the consistency and price of this product, but I wish the shade was lighter. I have very fair skin with neutral to cool undertones, and this pretty much matches my skin (might be like half a shade darker, actually). To make it work for brightening the undereye I have to mix it with LA Girl white concealer.
I'm usually a fan of Maybelline products (the Dream Wonder Liquid is great!), but this is a big disappointment. I would've been three, maybe even four stars, for it's blendability and relative coverage, even though it tends to create a crepe-y texture on dry skin.However, I've noticed that the last tube I received was INCREDIBLY darker than my previous tubes. I wasn't sent the wrong color, it certainly said "fair" on the tube, but it was almost a medium shade and very orange. This is supposed to be the same - or perhaps even a bit lighter - than the Maybelline Ivory/porcelain foundations... but it looked like I was wearing football grease paint. I thought this might've been a fluke, so I looked the next time I was in CVS - and, nope, the concealer is noticeably darker -- it even looked like the "light" shade a tad lighter. One of my friends wears the darkest shade (Cafe) and she also noticed strong inconsistencies in the shade level and undertone.
I have been buying designer brand concealer from sephora for a couple years now and thought it wouldn't hurt to try out a more inexpensive option. This concealer is just as good as the ones that I have spent up to $40 dollars on. It is definitely worth a try if you are contemplating getting it.
I LOVE THISSS!! It covers up all my dark spots and it makes my skin look so flawless!! I will buy again!!
This is my favorite affordable under-eye concealer. I've tried many others and the consistency and coverage of this Fit Me concealer is hard to beat. It doesn't dry your skin out and it sets really well. I do think it is a little dark for being called "Light" though.
The color is a nice match for me, since I'm buying it mostly for highlighting and covering dark circles under the eyes.The consistency is not that thick and it's really easy to blend.Lasts for quite a decent 5hrs on my oily face with my favorite Rimmel powder, without any primer on.The only down point is that I think the coverage of it is not as good as the Collection Lasting perfect Concealer.
So far this is my favorite drugstore concealer. I use it for my undereye area. I also use it to highlight and contour. This is a great to clean u the lip area when after applying liquid lipstick and also for creating a guide for shaping brows. Once your fill in your brows, you blend it out and it creates a soft highlight for your brow area. It is a super blendable formula. I am attaching a photo wear I used this concealer to help shape and highlight my brows. Love this product!
Although my tube of concealer was a bit messed up and I needed a refund the actual product is really good. I bought one at Walmart and it blends great on my under eyes , doesn't crease, covers my discoloration, and looks beautiful. I don't usually set it with powder or anything and it still last and looks great. I have pale skin. I wear n1 in loreal true match.  It's one of the best drug store concealers I think you can buy.
Great overall quality of this concealer... It covers dark circles well, isn't too thick, has lasting coverage, etc. It's an efficient and cheap concealer and I was really pleased with it the first time I wore it.HOWEVER, I was shocked when I looked in the mirror at the end of the day and saw that the color had oxidized and turned bright orange! I was happy with the original color (20 Sand), but it definitely did not stay the same shade after long-time wear. Needless to say, I am returning this product. I know some people swear by this concealer, but the color (for me at least) was not a good "fit." I hope anyone else who tries this has better luck.
Very natural concealer, brings a subtle highlight to my brown skin. I bought in the shade “cafe” and at first thought it would be too similar to my foundation but it’s yhe perfect shade. Buildable as well. My only concern is the container is so itty bitty and I wish there was more product but for a drugstore concealer...the price is right
Have been using this product around eye area. Nicely moist but doesn’t move after finishing powder. My fav.
My go to cover up! I'm not a fan of heavy makeup so this works great!
I like the different color selections. It’s very easy to use. I will stay with this for a while.
it is very  applicable and flawless.
I had heard this is a good dupe for NYX. I haven't tried NYX so I can't say that for sure. I will say this formula is a little thinner than I expected. I personally prefer a thicker formula but this product does well for what it is and it's price. I didn't have any creasing issues under my eyes with this product either.
Very small amount and gives burning sensation
it’s so much better than the nars one imo and it’s way cheaper. never buying any other concealer
Pretty good concealer for the price. Many say it is a drug store dupe for the Nars creamy concealer, which is much pricier. I find the Garnier dark circle roller to be better for underneath the eye area, but this is fine for covering up red marks, etc., on other areas of the face or even as an eyeshadow primer.
A little creasy but I have dry undereyes that I rarely take care of (my fault). Was a little darker than I expected but I'm neutral medium, but on the lighter side, so hard to match. Otherwise not bad for drugstore. I bought because Manny MUA recommended it.
It easily applies and blends nicely with other products. Given its light texture, it does need to be reapplied to hide blemishes and scars, but if using for highlighting this works well at a much more affordable price point than department store brands.
It’s a great produce but as someone with porcelain skin tone, the lightest shade (light) was a A LOT darker than my skin tone so I had to send back. That aside, it covers well and has great application. Definitely would get again if I had a good shade.
It was alright, but I don’t know if I got a defective tube or not but mine does not shut securely making it a mess in my bag.
will not buy again, just doesn't feel right
I use this as a eyeshadow base mostly. Works great. It's very sheer-medium coverage for a concealer so I rarely use it as such. I'd wait to buy this until it goes on sale on for $2.99. It does so often so just keep an eye out.
This is the only concealer I use for highlighting my under eye area. It is easy to blend, has just the right amount of coverage and most importantly it stays put for the whole day!I set it with Ben Nye banana powder and I am good for a whole day. No creasing, nothing.It is also really good for cleaning up under my brows and making them pop but if you would like it for this reason, make sure you get a shade or two lighter than your actual complexion.
my favorite drugstore concealer by far! BUT i ordered shade 10 light and it’s too dark for me. i think it might be different because when i bought it in stores it was the perfect shade for me! i’ll still use it but wish it was the correct shade color.
It’s so good I love how I use it
Concealed well just be sure you know what shade you need I got the wrong one but a friend of mine ended up using it and loved it
I like this product first time to use and will purchase ahain
It does not match my skin tone
Very happy with it. It works great on my pale skin. Next time I may choose one shade darker but that's all on me.Package arrived quickly after order.
I bought this to replace the expensive concealer that I had been using before, and also because lots of people on Youtube love to use it. I think this one does the job of a concealer, which is to give enough coverage. The problem of this product is that it doesn't last long. After applying this, I use the same brand's Fit me foundation. After 4-5 hours, the makeup seemed to be floating on my face, which might be because I didn't apply any primer and setting products, and also I have a not terribly oil skin.
I saw lots of the beauty gurus I follow on Youtube using and loving the Maybelline Fit Me concealer and thought I would give it a go. I find that it is a bit thin for my liking and doesn't cover much of my undereye darkness. I am very fair, so I have darkness whether I am well-rested or not, so I need something a bit more substantial than this. I also find that it creases under my eyes when I smile throughout the day, so I have to go over my makeup with a damp makeup sponge to "pat it out" smooth again. It isn't bad, but it isn't the best I have ever used.
This is a great replacement for my Nars creamy concealer. It is not as creamy (requires me to apply done eye cream prior to application as I have dry skin)  nor does it have as much coverage. For 1/7th of the cost (closer to 1/8th on subscribe and save) this will certainly be my everyday concealer. For those looking for Nars concealer dupes, I used custard in Nars and sand in the maybelline.
The formula is top notch for how much you pay for this product, but even the lightest shade (115 fair) is too dark for me, so I did have to get a lightener to mix in with it. Other than that, great coverage, comfortable under the eyes, and blends out beautifully.
As I'm getting older, I am finding that the darkness under my eyes is getting more and more noticeable. I've never been able to find that perfect concealer so I keep searching and trying.I found this concealer has good coverage for imperfections, but it's lighter than expected. It goes on smooth and doesn't draw attention to my fine lines.I'd purchase again, but will get a shade darker than I usually would.
It doesn’t stay long. Medium to light coverage .I must say true match to my skin tone .
I am in love with this concealer. I swear by it. I have used it consistently for the past 4 years. Every time I try a different concealer I am disappointed and return to this gem. Seriously such a great concealer. Provides adequate coverage while still being lightweight. Looks like skin. The 15 shade is lighter than the 10, just a heads up for my fellow pale people.
Super upset.  I bought this product because I needed it yesterday and when it arrived I realized the had the security tape cut already.  That is, it was open!!! And not only with it, another product I bought at the same time here, also from Maybeline, was also open. How will I be sure no one has used it?
Honestly anything by this company is great affordable makeup line
Let me say this first by saying I am new to concealers. But, this was just okay to me. I have Benefits Boing Brightening Concealer and that stuff is amazing. So, I was looking for something to put over that and well it was pretty obvious that it was a concealer. It didn't melt into my skin the way that the Benefits did. Maybe I should use a higher end concealer like NARS or Tarte, I don't know. But, I just wasn't that impressed.
I absolutely love this concealer. It covers under eye circles, pimples, redness around the nose, etc. I apply one swipe or dot to the area, let it sit for 30 seconds or so, then dab with a beauty blender. It’s great for when you just need to touch up a couple spots for a no makeup look, to carry in your purse, or to combine with foundation.
Just don’t.
I love this concealer I just wish they would update the applicator. Its tiny so you have to use more product. Other that that its wonderful & blends nicely.
I use the wand to smooth some under my eye and use my finger to blend it in. It seems to last quite a while, but I do not have to do the 8 hour work day anymore so I can not promise you wont have to touch up.  But it is easy to use.  So if you have dark circles to cover up give it a try.  I am on my 3rd purchase and recommend it to anyone in need.
My daughter uses this. It works perfect for her. She s a strawberry blonde, with very fair skin. It's the only one she uses.
I just now ordered this in Deep, and I own Cafe. EXCELLENT as an eyeshadow primer. another "eye only" prevents contamination. This has a soothing effect for me as I am allergic to a lot of products. So it is an Ok concealer for the price, but A-1 eye primer when set with powder or shadow. but individual results will vary. btw...I am 53 and use anti-aging stuff. ;-)
This concealer will dry up  and it just wasn't moist  or soft enough  It could be that it wasn't the right make up for my skin type  I love maybelline products but this one was n't for me
Love it! The tom is very accurate.
This works great. I use it to conceal under my eyes and then use a beauty blender to blend it all together. The only thing I don't like about this product is it is a little harder to get off at the end of the day. My Mary Kay foundation washes off with no issue, but this takes more effort to get off...so weird. Anyway, other than that, this works really well and brightens. I do recommend it. It is a great price and worth trying if you're curious.
I like the product but it's a little too light
This beats the Clinique Airbrush that I have been using for the last 10+ years by a long shot. Good coverage, consistency is nice and same amount (or more) product for less than a third of the price. I’m a convert.
Too bad to cover
Light: is not the shade for you unless you have an orange undertoneFAIR: if you’re pale, PORCELAIN like the one girl who claimed it was too orange she had the wrong colorThe fair shade is similar to urban decay vanillaIt’s light and pretty and it’s lightweightTry it it’s a couple bucks btw target will price match amazon on this item in personYou’re welcome
It's a pretty nice concealer. It doesn't do anything weird and doesn't crease. It's nice for a quick replacement concealer.
Altho' the color description says otherwise, this concealer is ORANGE! And the color is not light enough even when blended with makeup to "conceal".
Amazing.. perfect match for color i use it for a light makeup look. Couldn’t find any in stores so i said hey let me check amazon and here it is !!!!!
I really like this concealer.. The only thing that made me give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn't look natural. No matter what setting powder I use, it just looks a little cakey to me. I still use it though, it blends out like a dream and has great color payoff!
.  After spending $76 on a  foundation and a Coverage stick I immediately switched back to my Maybelline Fit Me Foundation and Fit Me Concealer.  It offers more coverage and smoother application in my opinion, and at a much cheaper price (less than $15 for both).  I love make up and a natural dewy finish on my skin. Maybelline makes it very easy to achieve
Works great. Covers dark areas under eyes as well as scars.
I liked this product, although I wish it had a little more added moisture, especially when being used under the eye.
Tip needs to be smaller for lines
Translate review to English
The Master Conceal is way better than this. This is almost sheer with no coverage.
I loooove this concealer! I think this is a pretty comparable dupe for the NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer. The color is great, it has a really nice consistency for covering up blemishes and I actually use it under my eyes for dark circles, as well. A little goes a long way, so I only go through one of these about every three - four months (and I wear makeup every day).
Great product! It was my mistake that I didn't double check the color before ordering. One kinda crazy thing that makes me love this product is that the shape of the tube is square! I've been through 5 hand surgeries with at least 2 more to go. The square shape lets me grip better making it so much easier to open and close! Thank you Maybelline for that feature.
I ordered the wrong color
My product came unsealed. Disappointed.
I’m not a big make up user, but when I step out sometimes I use it under the eyes to cover dark spots and makes you look better not like you’re so tired.
I normally use this concealer in the shade 15 Fair, and I like it just fine. The only problem is, it is not quite fair enough for my skin. I have English ancestry and my skin is naturally very pale, so I have trouble finding a concealer that is light enough for my skin.Silly me, I figured that the shade 10 would be lighter than the 15, but it is actually quite a bit darker, and a totally different shade. It is very yellow, and does not match my skin tone at all. It might work for someone with more of a golden undertone, but it's totally wrong for me, and thus I can't use it for anything. As a rule, I would advise against purchasing concealer online if you don't know for sure that it will match your skin tone properly, but I couldn't find this shade in any stores.That issue aside, I like the consistency and the coverage is okay, but it won't cover up dark spots very well because it's translucent. It does tend to wipe off pretty easily during the day as your skin produces more oil, but will stay on fine if you don't touch your face too much.Update: I have stopped using all Maybelline products because the company tests on animals.
Great stuff. Full coverage. I have genetic dark circles so intense I look like I "fell down the stairs" if you catch my drift. Combined with a corrector, this stuff COVERS. I use it on t-zone redness as well. I've gone through countless tubes of this, and I see no reason to spend more on a concealer anymore. I always have this in my purse. Always.
This product goes on smooth and has good coverage. I prefer this to the NYC brand and IT cosmetics concealers.
Creamy
Feels and looks great! Great coverage and it lasts!
I know a lot of ppl love itBut i'm not sure about my feeling for thisI use it for covering my acne scar and it didnt fully cover up.  And after sweat and a wipe of my hand it just gone( but is there any concealer that wont go away after heavy sweating and wipe?) so i m not sure if it s my fault or it s about the product.But the color is so good on me and it does not crack and cover up dark eyes well.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Great full  coverage concealer that's easy to blend. I was skeptical for the price but this stuff is amazing.  I have fair skin and usually makeup is too yellow or pink. This shade in fair is perfect neutral.  It has staying power and doesn't oxidize or leave creases or that heavy cake feeling or look. I plan on buying more would be great for contouring.
lOVE LOVE LOVE so good. lasts a long time
This is a great concealer to use under your eyes. It is very creamy and able to be applied easily. Much better than drugstore prices.
So... I was looking for something that is light enough for my skin tone. I have a very pale skin with grey undertone (yes, like a corpse) and it's almost impossible to find a foundation or a concealer that won't look too yellow or orange on me.  I hoped this one might work, but... No way. It's so dark and orange, is it really the lightest color they have? I'm disappointed. But concealer itself is nice, just not for me. Will continue searching for something that will not turn my face into a peach
I never even use makeup but I occasionally get small blemishes and this covers them nicely.
Good concealer. Didn’t match my color completely but that’s ok.
Great coverage, not heavy and last long. I used to use Elizabeth Arden concealer, until they discontinua my perfect tone. After trying some other expensive brands, nothing worked for me. Affordable concealer not always have the color I need, buy as soon as I discovered Maybelling Fit Me... I'm married for life with them. Hope the Cafe tone never ever get discontinue.
Came in a 2 pack and was a perfect match for my skin color. Spreads a long ways and wears well.
its good and i love it, i’ll definitely buy more
Good makeup
I'm very fair - we're talking nc15. I bought this in the shade Fair, and I could probably use it as a highlight! While it's great that they've made a concealer that's too light for me, I don't want to put this on my scarring. Under the eyes, it's nice. I mix it with my Maybelline Instant Age Rewind concealer in Fair. It comes out a great color and I think they have the same coverage for under the eyes. Also, I was pleasantly surprised this was in a pack of two.
I LOVE this product and have repurchased many times. The only disclaimer I have is that it does cause a slight tingling/burning under the eye when you initially put it on. I would love to know the reason behind this.Great Quality Product!
Product seems to work very well… Easy to use… Does the job and great price!
Coverage was quite good but seems very drying under the eye especially. Settled into creases of the course of a few hours, even with moisturizer and primer. Will continue to use on other parts of my face because i hate wasting stuff, but wont buy again. Need something a bit more hydrating.
Excellent value
Loving this concealer! Smooth and long lasting!
This product applies smoothly and lasts all day which is surprising for me because I have very oily skin. It was a lot lighter than I expected which is a bit of a challenge when blending. Overall, I really like this product and would recommend it for those looking for great coverage and durability.
I really like this concealer as I've bought it in stores before. I just got the wrong shade as it was still a little yellowish on my fair complexion. The product works wonderfully!
This was pretty good. Easy to blend.
Love this color matches and doesn't crease.
This is a near perfect drugstore concealer. It goes on well and isn't too drying. It covers very well, comparable to my more expensive concealers. The way it wears is beautiful! Not too heavy, not cakey. It's one of my go-to products! Love!!
My all time favorite everyday concealer. Great for dry skin
used for eye brows loved it matched my shade just right.
I have the worst time finding concealers since I have a pale pink skintone- most concealers, even when fair enough, are too yellow. This one was great though. I get good coverage and it matches my skintone so well that I sometimes don't even wear foundation with it, I just conceal and set with powder. I would definitely recommend it as a good drugstore brand.
I reach for this concealer more than I do my higher end concealer. It doesn't completely hide dark circles, but my blemishes are invisible when layering this over my foundation. The formula is not watery, but not super thick either. If I don't set with powder it will crease, but I haven't found a concealer yet that didn't.
I got this in a desperate attempt to find a concealer that wasn't going to make me look like a zombie!  I was pleasantly surprised that it matched my skin tone and gave great coverage to my skin tone as, (being bi-racial), I often struggle with finding the right shades.  It also blends very nicely with foundations to give a real consistent and smooth look.
I like this concealer. It is easy to apply with the wand. I wish I could get every last drop out of it when it starts to run out but not possible to reach it all with the wand.
This is a get what you pay for product. I purchased the pink tint which doesn't do much for my under eye. Maybe the green tint would be better suited. Is barely visible and thinner than foundation
Perfect skin tone.
Light was a good color for me. Covers sun spots pretty well.  Not too thick, blends in well.  The sponge applicator is a bit thick to dab, so I use a small brush.
I have used this concealer for I think a few years and its perfect. I am very pale so it is hard to match my shade, but this does the trick and goes on smooth and even.
This is 1 of the best concealers available. I am fair with yellow undertones and 15 works best for me. I use Revlon foundation in Buff 150. Unfortunately, Maybelline fit me foundation line doesn't have the right shade but this concealer does work. If you can find the right shade I Highly recommend this product!
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Easy to apply; the price point was great. A smidge darker than expected, but I can mix it with the 15 Fair color on the days I'm feelin' a little more sunkissed / tan than usual. :)
Concealer works nicely
I really like this concealer definitely won’t be spending anymore money for super expensive makeup that doesn’t even work this is perfect.
Does the job. I love everything on the maybelline fit me line.
Love this for cleaning job my eyebrows and/or concealing under my eyes.Great price point & lasts all day.
The color was nice but it was more of a mate there was no shine to it and made my face look a little dry
No matter how much moisturizer I used prior, still settled in lines.
Ordered "FAIR" like I have been for YEARS. They changed the shade without warning people!!! Why fix what's not broken?! "Fair" is no longer a neutral, light shade, but now a darker yellow shade. At least warn people before we spend our money on what's been the same shade FOR YEARS only to find out once we put it on our faces that it is a whole new shade! I'm so mad. I bought FOUR because I love the stuff and always run out so I bought in bulk. WELP MAYBELLINE THIUGHT IT'D BE FUNNY FOR ME TO HAVE DARK UNDER MY EYES AND ON MY NOSE AND CHIN! Don't change shades without warning people. I went and checked all of their social media and website and there is no information on shade changes. Now, I have to find my actually shade through trial and error. The quality and performance of the actual product is amazing for the price/drugstore brand. That's why I bought 4. But the shades are off now so if you're used to buying a certain shade, you may need to go test in-store.
Just really got into concealing my eyes for crazy make up looks so it cheap and get the job done! Better the more expensive concealers !!!
Nice and ordered another one in a lighter stage!  Received ivory today!  GREAT!
This product is amazing. It is not my color but it still works amazing! 😂
That’s very good! I used it every day and it lasts all day! The smells is also good! Easy to apply and easy to remove.
This really did not work well for me! It is thick and creases into the skin, making it hard to blend. I tried it a few times just to make sure I was giving it a chance.Every time I used it, it enhanced fine lines under my eyes. It just caked onto my face, I had to remove and start my under eye process again.
This doesn’t cover well and it has a weird glue-like smell to it.
This is one of the best concealers I have used. It blends easy and has a good coverage.
I had ordered 2 nos.,paid for 2 too but received only 1.Kindly help.
So creamy and smooth and a little product goes a long way. However, it does not offer as much coverage as I would like, but on the flip side it has a very natural finish. Overall, this is great and I use it often!
I love it , it blends well with my complexion, long lasting.
I was dubious of this but bought it anyway because of the raves. Believe them. I got light even though I'm very light. It's not too dark and the coverage is remarkable. I put it under my eyes and on my lids as I'm on medication (latisse) that gives my eyelids and undereyes a slightly pinkish tinge and I look a big ghoulish. I can't get over how well it covers and takes 5 years off me at least. It's really all the makeup I need now. Wow. It's that good.
Did not come with any type of sealing tape on the actual product but overall I love this concealer.
I can’t believe how inexpensive this product was. It goes on matte and isn’t oily. Love it. The seal may have already been broken though, I couldn’t tell if I did it while taking it out of the box or not. Not enough to deter me, just something to mention!
I bought this because I noticed my other concealer was running low and didn’t want to run completely out. I used it today under my eyes and immediately it started burning my skin. Now my eyes have been watering really bad ever since I used it. I don’t know what is in this concealer but I swear if it damages my skin or my eyesight 🤬🤬🤬🤬 I just went back and read reviews and seen where someone else said that it burned their skin as well. Amazon needs to pull this off their website ASAP.
Love this concealer. Cheap and works great. Sometimes I’ll just use this on my face and it covers a lot. Will buy again for sure
I received my concealer with a broken seal. I like the concealer just wish it wasn’t tampered with.
Great concealer with strong staying power. I just wish it came in a paler, less warm shade (it's a little bit yellow.) I'm not the palest person ever, but I'm still fair enough that even the lightest shade of this product doesn't quite match.
Good at concealing and brightening
This is my favorite concealer out of the so many I have tried. I even prefer it over high-end brands. It is very creamy, pigmented, and bit thick (which I looove). I got the shade in medium, I am an NC30 at Mac, if that helps. This is the perfect color for my skin, especially because it has yellow undertones.
I have very fair, warm toned skin and the 10 Light was too dark. The coverage was good and it is easy to apply. I'll probably try again with a lighter shade and see how that works out.
This shade (10 Light) is a little darker than I was expecting, but it actually works quite well to brighten my undereye area now that it's summer. The shade is yellow-toned, which I like for covering purplish dark circles, blemishes, and other purply redness. It has a nice creamy consistency that is thick enough to stay where you put it after blending, but doesn't look cakey at all. It has excellent coverage for a drugstore concealer. Maybelline makes some great concealers! I'll definitely be repurchasing this one.
All good!  58 and circles under the eyes.  This covers when others didn’t really do much.  Good and inexpensive product.
Natural to medium coverage and looks like skin
I like this product
My girls and I have worn this before. This is always a favorite for us. No need to spend tons of money on this stuff because this product definitely does its job!
Creamy. Doesn’t feel dry or oily. Not super long lasting
As some have already mentioned, this is very similar to Nars concealer. I would describe the coverage as slightly less opaque but for the low pricetag, I don't mind adding a second layer for coverage. I would say this is a pretty good dupe and somewhat lighter in shade when compared to Nars Ginger.
Average
#15 light~I just received this like 5 mins ago, although I haven't put it on my face, I did dab it on my hand and I already know that's its way too dark for my skin. It's too orange. I usually either buy light or light beige but I think I would need fair just to somewhat match. Will update if I end up using and liking but for now I'm very unhappy w/this purchase.
Compared to other more expensive concealers this one sits on the skin right and is the best value for the money without breaking the bank.
Color was a little off
Performs as indicated. Good coverage. Applicator could be a bit more delicate.
I love this concealer and use it for under my eyes to conceal dark circles. This is a very lightweight concealer that does not crease. A small amount goes a long way and you are much better off using a concealer brush than your finger in order for it to set in properly. I have had no trouble with this lasting all day. It works great for my sensitive skin.
The best concealer ever used!
I was half expecting it to be the same shade as the 110 foundation but its noticeably darker, yellowy, so that I cant just spot correct when I see my blemishes are peaking through. Kind of disappointing, but the coverage is still pretty nice.
Love it great color
The covers and blends well. It does sink into fine lines a little under the eye but what concealer doesnt?
Stays in place all day. I used to use tarte shape tape which I thought was the best but after trying this I realized I don’t have to pay $30 when I can get the same thing for 1/4 of the price.
Cheap but works pretty darn good.  I like this concealer.  For the money it does a good job for those darker under-eye circles.  I have very fair skin but I am also pretty ruddy in complexion.  This helps brighten my face up and seems to last well into the afternoon.  I could probably reapply it during the early afternoon to get prolonged coverage but I don't typically do that. Better than other drug-store concealers I have tried.
Works and matches
I’m not impressed with this product
I’m mildly allergic to dimethicone so high end concealers are a no go for me. This does the trick with no burning or redness from the allergy.
Works well, good coverage and doesn't settle into fine lines.  I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily, this concealer does not aggravate my skin at all.  Hides the redness around my nose and sunburn scar really well.
Works better with sponge than fingers or brush. Wouldn’t use for a lightweight, minimal makeup look; it just doesn’t blend well without foundation/full coverage look.
I love it
love it.
Absolutely not, this is a nightmare to blend out and the dark shade is very orangey.
Arrived with seal broken and looked kinda empty,  like it's been used before. I received another product from maybelline and it had a white seal, new one, unbroken.  This one had a clear seal and it was already broken and had another label that was covering the original one..none of them was attached to the cap and the clear one thats supposed to be for security was broken.
Love this. I use it daily. And so cheap!
This is my all-time favorite concealer. I use it everyday and it lasts at least 10 hours without a lot of setting required. I use with a light dusting of powder foundation during the day and it does not crease. I've heard many YouTube beauty gurus rave about this product and it is apparently comparable to NARS' radiant creamy concealer. I purchased it for less than at the drugstore so keep watching the price!
Perfect texture and light coverage
What dark circles? We don't know her.
A friend told me about this! I'm super white and I always need the lightest there is to offer when it comes to make up (I finally learned this and accepted it! I'm never going to be a tan goddess! Aaaanyway....) and I love this concealer because it's got enough coverage to cover up blemishes but you can't really tell you're wearing it! Buy it! Try it out and see. I only buy this kind now.
It seemed at first like it'd work very well, but it simply doesn't provide enough coverage. I only had 3 tiny blemishes and it wasn't easy to get it to cover easily.
Good concealer for a great price. I've used high end brands and most of them don't compare to the consistency of this one. It's medium coverage but can be build to full coverage. Every time I try a new concealer, it would solidify my decision to repurchase this concealer. Try it and see for yourself!
Good product. If I were diligent about perfection I'd probably have to touch this up at least once during the day. Instead, it looks great in the morning, & still looks like it's taken the edge off my giant dark circles at the end of a long day.
I used for contouring and it blends nicely.
I LOVE the Maybelline Fit foundation. It's the only drug store brand makeup I use and I like it much better than any of the more expensive foundations I've tried. So, when I was on a quest for a new concealer, I thought this was worth a shot. I'm extremely fair and wear the 112 in the foundation. I purchased the 10 - Light in the concealer but it's much darker than the foundation. If I spread it out enough, it's not terrible, but definitely not a great match.
Not very full coverage. Has a natural skin finish that is pretty. Doesn’t cover acne very well. And if you have any under eye circles it won’t cover them completely. But if you need something light to cover redness it works
it burns when I apply it!
This works surprisingly well, given the price. Makes me look so much more awake. I like the little applicator wand. One tube of this lasted me a year. I don't know if it expired, but the quality didn't deteriorate over time.
works well and lasts long
It's okay. Doesn't stay long. Not for me.
Not intense , not fully coveredIt made my eyes more dryNot impressed
I like this product but I ran out so I ordered it again but only mascara came and I’m confused on the mix up since they’re different
It's a great product. I have been using it everyday since I got it. I use it to brighten the dark area on my face. It is silky and moist. It doesn't become dry and become solid pieces even if it is applied underneath my eyes for a long period of time. The price is cheap but can even match the top tier brands.
Absolutely love this concealer
pretty mediocre concealer, about the same amount of coverage as the fit me foundation (which I love) but minus the diverse colour selectionif you're looking for a light concealer you'd be better off picking something else or just using the fit me foundation as a concealer
This is a good concealer, though depending on sweat needs to be reapplied at least once during the day (I apply in the mornings, and once in the late afternoon/evening). The 10 fits my tone very well, even though I usually am somewhere between it and the next lightest.
The product comes by itself no packaging, so just make sure you look for it because it’s small. But all in all great product
Everything is fine, but amazon send me twice wrong color.. I want the lighter color as highlighter.. and I am tried to do the refund,, cuz the product itself is great!!!, just the color is not what I need 😂😂😂
I love this concealer! Definitely comparable to the NARS concealer which I love too, but this is just so much more affordable. It’s super creamy and easy to blend and long lasting!
This product has become my favorite both for my personal and customer use, as it is not greasy, seals well, and does not make flashback, I definitely recommend it.
This is normally great makeup but the color I received was 1 or 2 shades darker than normal
Did the job
good concealer, but i don't recommend buying it online because it doesn't go with your skin color as much as you think it would. online it may be cheaper but in stores you can tell if it is the right shade. this product causes light irritation, but what doesn't? very easy to apply and blend, too. overall, this product is 4-5 stars.
For inexpensive concealer, it does the job. I mostly wear it when I’m going to the gym. Stays on pretty well!
I got the shade in Light and its a bit more yellowy in person, but that's okay. I like it. It covers really well. It causes me a tiny bit of irritation but that's because I have very very dry sensitive skin.
Burned some and caused slight swelling.
This is my go to concealer- when you first apply it you may look ridiculous, but in a matter of a few minutes the product is absorbed by the skin and looks nice and natural. I think they should offer a few more shades, but for the price,t he quality is excellent.
This is a great concealer, especially for under the eyes as it isn't too drying and it doesn't cause my liners to run either. Some concealers can be too sticky or cake up when drying, this one sets very nicely with a light dusting of powder, All day wearability.
I am very picky about concealers and needed a good one for under the eyes. This one has the right amount of yellow for my fair skin to balance out the dark circles. Blends smoothly, good amount of coverage for a drugstore brand.
Product is full coverage. It helps conceal my under eye circles very well.
👍
The one thing I dont really like about this is that it's the shade as my foundation. I wear 112 ivory by fit me and the fair should've been lighter, but it's not. Needless to say cant put it on my face but definitely will use it for cut crease looks.
The product itself is great, I love how smooth and creamy and easy to apply it is. Decent coverage, I would say light-medium but build-able.My issue and why I gave the product 3 stars was that I received what seems to be a used product. There was not shrink wrap on the product itself and when I opened it, it looks like someone else used it. I'm very disappointed.
It's a very good product for its prize. For me it worked perfect, it covers imperfections and it lasted the whole day.
Good reasonably price product
This concealer is really thin and watery. I’m very fair with no blemishes and this wouldn’t even cover any slight redness or minor  discolorations on my skin. The color was a close match but the concealing ability is non existent. It’s cheap so I gave it a chance but I would never recommend this product.
I can never find products to match my skin tone because I am super super pale but I have really dark purple circles underneath my eyes. Most color correcting doesn't work for me either. I purchased this product in 15 fair, and it is literally a perfect match! Easy to apply with great staying power, and for a good price. I love it!
I have tried bare minerals but it doesn’t go well with my liquid foundation! But this one works well with Nars liquid foundation. I would recommend!
I am naturally very pale, which makes it extremely hard to find foundations and concealers that don't give me an orangey tone. This is my go to concealer, as I can use it on most of my face for light coverage that works well for how lazy my routine is and is great for summer weather as well as winter.
Love this concealer. Been using it for years!
Love the product. Just thought it didnt go a long way. It seemed like it was not completely filled with product.
The covering is perfect for me.
This product was very water down
I am giving this a lukewarm review along with the foundation. I thing this would be good if you are just starting off and experimenting with makeup. You really cannot beat the price. It is easy to apply. If you are not sure how, YouTube is a great resource for that. I would definitely recommend a primer under this if you have dry or combo skin (like me). Not certain this line has that product. No irritation to report and I have very sensitive skin.
Great product and a perfect Nars dupe.  I use it to cover blemishes and apply it with clean, washed fingers or a concealer brush.  I actually love this product for under eyes better than the over-hyped age rewind under eye concealer also by Maybelline. I’ve been using this concealer for years and recently began purchasing via Amazon.
Excellent coverage
This is one of the best concealers I've used in a while. It really helped conceal the dark circles under my eyes, although it doesn't cover acne scars very well.
Nice color shade
Not thick at all , has a weird smell and your dark circles still show
Translate review to English
I have this on subscribe and save. It lasts for a long time, but definitely just for spot treatments. I do need to reapply if I have a particularly troubling blemish.
I like the product but it wasn't the color I was looking for.
This product and price point are EVERYTHING right in the make up world. However, if you go from using a higher end concealer such as Tarte or MAC do not expect the same results. This is a very thin concealer that is buildable and requires additional building for extra coverage.
It seems to wear off, but the color blends well.
Excellent concealer!!!♥️♥️♥️
Good
Good coverage and goes on smooth
I absolutely love this product! I've been looking for a concealer for a while and my friends recommended this one. They said its equivalent to the NARs concealer. I can’t really say if that’s true because I’ve never tried the NARs concealer. But I did want something on the cheaper side that wouldn’t cost me a leg and an arm. It’s super easy to apply, covers really well, and stays on all day!
I love this color!  I was hesitant because of the price but it was worth it.  I wish it came in a larger bottle.  Blends perfectly. The only other concealer I use is fawn by LA pro but this is my other option as of now.  No creasing under my eyes either.
I don't particularly like the one I bought from here - I ordered light 10. It's a bit darker than I expected and it oxidized pretty badly for me. However, I bought Fair 15 from I think walmart and it was the right color for me - lighter than the light one - and so far no issues with oxidization. I have to wonder if I just got a tube from a bad batch.
Great coverage
Good product for the price! A bit "thin" but it works out just fine
Great concealer for normal skin. I have very dark circles around my eyes because I don't get enough of sleep ( have 2 kids, 3 y.o and 6 m.o), and I was getting very disappointed of how I started to look, and needed to hide my circles. After trying it on, I couldn't be happier. It hid my dark circles around my eyes, but also made me look so natural and beautiful!!!
Their fairest color is not really all that fair. I wish that this came in a near-white because it is a very nice formula with good coverage. Just, pale people beware - it is probably not going to work on your skin.
Translate review to English
Would definitely purchase again!!
Good wear. No cake face or dark circles!
Can't say anything bad. it's a good product. I used it maybe once tho but that was me. I just don't use it. I tried getting whatever I can to hide my dark circles but doesn't work. Nothing does. Not $5 make up not $50 make up. I would rather buy this than something from ulta that "swears" it's heaven sent 😒😒😒
It goes on silky and doesn’t turn to a sallow color later in the day. It stays looking fresh.
Translate review to English
Love this, I used to use the dream lumi highlighing concealer, but I always ran out of that too fast because you barely get any product with it. I saw there was a coupon for this one and have heard a lot of great things about it so I decided to give it a try and I LOVE IT! You really get a lot of product too! Will definitely purchase again!
It has really good coverage, and feels really nice after it has been set. However, every time I use it I have a burning feeling where I used it. That's likely the formula especially since there is no fragrance. It does work decent for cutting the crease, and it doesn't burn in that case.
Perfect for what I needed
Not heavy. Does not add "cakeness" to the skin texture.
This is my favorite concealer am dark skin and have alot of dark areas on face and neck this works great to hid the dark spots
product is good , easy to apply the coverage is great  ill give it a 4.5 for coverage the black in the container rubbed off slightly and the shade medium was right for my skini would recommend if you don't want to spend money on an expansive concealer
The color is exactly what I was looking for. I was so happy to find a concealer that was significantly less than the department store prices. I now buy all my makeup on Amazon, because Amazon's prices beat department store prices. The color is exactly as advertised, and the product works well. The consistency is good, and the product stays on all day. I'm happy with my purchase!
The container was open and only half full when I received it. It does not seem to go on well and I have to go back into the bottle 2 or 3 times to do under just one eye. It does moisturize but does not last the whole day.
This concealer does nothing.  I am 46 and don't typically use concealer but wanted to try for the dark under my eyes and a few spots on my face but this does not even cover anything really.  Its useless
Waw
Decent
Great! I love how this product is cheap and it works great. I normally use Maybelline products. I thought it would be great to try theirs. Considering I've only used the Elf or Nyc for coverup so I wasn't at very high standards. But it works great. Much better than those other brands.
Love the product! Covers well under my eyes.
Product looks a tad “cakey” but worth the price.. would not compare it to name brand
As a new mom, I discovered just how bad dark circles can get...with that being said, this concealer is a lifesaver! Goes on nice. I let it set a minute before blending. Blends well and gives coverage! Decided on this after searching youtube for drugstore top products. Super happy with this purchase!!!
Works well with Fit Me foundation
This is my go to drugstore concealer it’s super light weight but has some good buildable coverage
Doesnt fully cover up acne but it works enough for acne to be hard to notice. i usually have to apply it twice a day
Cheap and works great
I love this concealer. I’m semi new to makeup and I’ve loved this concealer since I’ve started using it
Excellent coverage under eye bags and wrinkles.  Long lasting coverage and a great price for the money
It's very creamy, and nice, but wasn't light enough for my skin tone. I would buy it again, but next time in person.
its good
When I bought it I was expecting a thicker tube with more product. But instead I was surprised with a thin tube with product gone in a day or two. I typically use this brand with no complaints but this is the first time Im actually disappointed.
Hard to tell what the right color is from an Internet picture. Ended up buying something a shade too dark for my skin, but think I would like the product if I had the right shade. My advise is to buy a shade lighter than you think you need.
It said light on the site but its actually fair. The number of the color match just not the name listed.But thats a huge deal for me since i have a warm skin tone, even though im pretty pale when i use any products for fair skin its too cool and sort of ends up making my face look dirty.The formula also didnt work well with my other products but im currently searching for the right make up for my skin as i all the sudden am getting older and need to change my routines. Perhaps id try this again if it was on sale but i wasnt very impressed with the formula
This is my favorite concealer. As a very pale girl, with the purple undereye circles that come along with being pale, finding a light enough concealer that will hide those circles is a huge struggle. This one is amazing. It lasts a long time, doesn't irritate my skin, and isn't cakey. It's perfect!
Conceals quiet well for a drug store brand. My issue was that it didn’t cover certain spots; wasn’t as high coverage as I expected.
For the price, it is a really good concealer.  It is a bit thick and oily....but it has nice coverage!
Seemed like it was half empty
this is my favorite concealer and it beats imo some of the higher end concealers i’ve tried. i wish it would last me longer tho :(
Got this because Bailey Sarian uses it and woooow I love this product lol.
For those days when you stayed up too late the night before and now you have to be at work at 7am... Slap some of this under those eyes and you're now good to go. 👌
Covers great
works decent
the seal was broke so no i wont use it as far as the product the color was definitely  what i wanted
My go to! Love!
It's a bit watery but overall it covers well and get the job done to be honest.
Great coverage
This arrived opened and not even in a box
Gift
This product is definitely a must buy, especially for the cost! Great coverage, not caked, stays on all day.
Sheerness and lasts all day
People always say this is a dupe for Nars Creamy concealer. While I can't vouch for that, I can say I can't imagine it could be much worse than its $30 counterpart! Great coverage, perfect color than my skin (although to me 10 looks darker than 15, this is because 10 is yellow toned and 15 is pink). Pale Irish girls like me will love this product.
Its okay. But kind of burns a little and I dont normally have sensitive skin
I've been using this for years to cover my dark circles.  It goes on easily, doesn't crease or run.  Will use this for the rest of my life!
When I went to go in my package, the seal on the concealer broke and it looked like the color was darker. It wasn't packaged like my other individual items they came at least wrapped.
I like this product.  It's getting hard to find it in a store.  this was perfect and at a very good price.  Arrived very quickly.
I got a too light color. You live and learn. If I would of gotten the right color it would of been great.
This concealer cannot be paired with the Smooth+Dewy Fit Me Foundation. Since the foundation itself is quite "wet" when you first put it on, if you put the concealer on immediately after the foundation, it doesn't stick. The concealer slips and slides on the face and is hard to blend. It's easier to use after the foundation has set for a bit, but it still isn't a good mix.Like the other Maybelline face products, it is sheer which allows for a more buildable coverage.
My favorite concealer of all time! I was originally using the Becca coverage concealing creme spending $30+. I then was introduced to this concealer and have stopped using Becca! I have saved a lot of money and I still get the coverage I need! You do not need to apply a lot. I use this concealer everyday under my eyes and it has lasted me 2 months! LOVE LOVE!
The seal to the concealer was broken. Wondering why this is an issue. Has this product been used before? Don’t know why else it would arrive open like many other people say.
Goes on so smoothly and blends in nicely! I’ve bought this concealer many times and it’s buildable so you can build it up to any coverage.
Wow I really like this I have never really found a liquid conclear I liked and I have tried many, until now this one works well.
Awesome product
Goes on smoothly not to much coverage more of a natural look
not bad, but expected more. was gone in about 6 hours. has it to be burning? because it's burned/ stung espetialy under eye, not always and not everyday but once in three days or so.. still bad feeling.  :(  not best one for dark spots. was working well for about 2 hours, than dark spots started appearing again.
I had bought this for the up coming school year just to have on hand and I am a very very pale person with porcelain skin I hoped that this would match my skin color but it was just way to dark. The product in the actual bottle is a very nice consistency and smooth on the skin I just wish it was my skin color
I use this concealer under my eyes. It goes on smoothly, and although it looks too dark at first, it looks lighter when I blend it in. Lasts and does not crease if set.
I really like the FIT ME line of cosmetics but I just wish it came in a bigger container! The concealer bottle is small but the amount is not very much.
I am an Asian girl with slight whiter skin yet uneven tone, this color fits me. I use it to cover under-eye darker circle. and usually, apply it before foundation. they blend well.
This concealer doesn't make my face flawless, but it works pretty well in helping reduce those flaws and I can ask for more with this price.
This ended up being a tad bit too dark for my skin tone but great coverage!!! I can’t blame the vendor for the tone being off....it’s the chance taken with selecting colors online instead of in person. Even still, a great purchase.
Really  good product . Have been using it for two years and I have been really happy with the overall look . Great shade it looks and feels nice . Not heavy  on the face & easy to apply . I really enjoy using the Maybelline products they are affordable and hassle free . Arrived super fast& in perfect shape . I buy the fair 15 and it really suits me .
This is the concealer that I have been using for a long time. I was using nars but yall knw how expensive that is. So I tried this and haven't gone back.
I used a high end concealer that everyone raved about for a while but it never really worked for me the way it did for everyone else. This Maybeline one doesn't dry out my under eyes or seem to bother my super sensitive under eye skin plus I've been using it as an eyeshadow base it works perfectly! For me this is perfection!
It sure is good
Love this concealer I’ve been using it for a while. It’s perfect and the texture is nice and smoothing.
Works exactly as described. Being very fair skinned, its difficult to find a concealer that is too dark for my skin. This one works great!
loved it! wish they had more diverse shades. stays on all day and blends in really well
I use this for under my eyes and brightening and it works great. Great coverage and on top of primer, it lasts all day.
I love concealer it’s my favorite
Love this concealer! Full coverage and last on my face for 10-12+ Hours—basically all day! Love it!
The product itself is good, my problem is that I ordered two colors, and both came with broken seals and appeared to have been used. I returned them.
I have pale skin and need to use Maybelline fit me shade 110 which is the lightest foundation. But this is the lightest concealer and it's in shade 10 which my friend has to use to conceal his shade maybelline fit me 125 skin tone. So I gave it to him to use because it does not show up on my pale af skin.
This is good, but it had yellow undertones rather than pink like it appears in the bottle- made me look off. It's not a bad color, but it is more for yellow/golden undertones whereas I need something a little different.
I have ordered this only twice but the color was more yellow color than the first time. Even though I ordered same color. I needed so I had to use it but not happy with it.
Love being able to order make up without having to leave the house. Especially during these pandemic times.
This concealer is fantastic quality and it really gets the job done. It covers by dark circles, my redness, and my occasional pimple. The color was very close to what I wanted, but it was a bit too orange. I will maybe true a different color. Nonetheless, if you want a great concealer for a great price, look no farther.
I usually don't post reviews. But I had to for this one--I love this concealer. If it's the correct shade for you, it really is the best. Lightweight product, but does the job perfectly!! I like it more than some of the high-end concealers I've bought in the past.
This product is a good value for the money, covers well, and stays on.  The older I get the more I need concealer.  Would recommend.
Great product, works well when I have dark marks under my eyes when I can't sleep but as a general concealer it works better than most that I have tried
Love this conceler. It's a very sheer formula so I use it when I don't want a heavy make up day. Dont get me wrong it has great coverage, but it feels light under your eyes.
Used for under eye
The product is easy to apply and the color is as expected. I still use it daily, however, I experienced a slight irritation. I say this with caution because I think I just have sensitive skin! I would most likely recommend this product to others, but am starting to become more aware of checking what are in these make up products.
I wish I'd thought of using a product like this years ago because it would've saved me from years of embarrassing breakouts and nasty scarring.  Luckily the color I picked matches my skin color almost exactly, thank you Maybelline!
This worked very nicely and blended super nicely and overall looked amazing. The only problem was it that once I received it it was empty. Almost like the concealer was just on the outside to make it look like it was full but on the inside there was barely any left. Other than that amazing product!
my fav drugstore concealer, but i definitely recommend setting with a loose powder or else it will cake in your under eye creases!!
I don't know if I just chose the wrong color, but this liquid concealer was way too light for my skin tone and stung when I applied it anywhere on my face. I have not had this happen to me with any other concealer, but that doesn't mean everyone has the same experience. This just wasn't the right concealer for me.
My first concealer so I really have nothing to compare this too but I really like it & it covers well. I only need to apply once under my powder and It hides all my blemishes and dark spots really well.
This concealer is so good on my skin, it blends very well and hides what I need covered. I use it under my foundation and it’s like its not even there. I’ll gladly get this again
This works so much better than I thought it would - I love it! My expectations weren't high because of the price being so low, but I decided to give it a try & am so glad I did. The coverage is great and a little bit of product goes a long way. Definitely recommend!
Great product I love how light it feels and how bright my under eye area is
The Sand color ended up having a yellowish tint to it. Will get lighter next time. The coverage was good though, and it went on well.
The color is nice. The consistency is a bit watery.
Very good
Glides on and gives a look of skin. Long wearing, left on one night and still their in the morning light. Wonderful.
Just what I expected.
good, sheer coverage for casual days, was a bit lighter for me i should have ordered a darker shade, all in all good for everyday use but not the best coverage
This is the only concealer I’ve used, so I have nothing to compare it to. However, I am very impressed and pleased with how well it stays on without creasing. I highly recommend!
ONE OF THE BEST CONCEALERS YET...I USE IT UNDER MY EYES AND ON SOME AGE SPOTS, COVERS GREAT.  I WILL BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, HAVE SUGGESTED IT TO SEVERAL FRIENDS THAT HAVE VERY DARK CIRCLES UNDER THEIR EYES, THEY FOUND IT MUCH BETTER THAN THE PRODUCTS THEY HAVE USED IN THE PAST.
just so so.another Maybelline fit me better
It does't look very well on my face, because it isn't  my color and also i think that it's not for my skin type. It will be better for oily skin, so I don't like it very much :(
The quality of the product as good as described
One of my fav concealers. I always keep this and use it along with my other high end concealers.
The Maybelline Fit Me Concealer is the only drugstore concealer that I have been able to use under my eyes and to also cover blemishes and dark spots. It is pigmented enough and the right consistency, not too thin or too thick. You have to be really careful to not apply too much under the eyes or you could have some slight settling in the fine lines.
This is a great long-wearing product. I had been using Mac and Tarte until I discovered this one. I like how blendable and long wearing it is, yet gentle on my sensitive skin.
best for the price
Had an open mind, tried it, it went on smooth, however became whiney and greasy in a very period of time.it did come in a timely manner, just not a product for my oily skin type
I like the this concealer. It did not crease up which a lot of concealers do on me. It gives good coverage without being too thick.
Love this stuff! It works, the color is perfect and the price is right. I do have extremely sensitive skin around my eyes and there is a light sensitivity once the product is first applied but then it feels normal within seconds. My skin around my eyes reacts to many products negatively, including Clinique and other department store products, but this product it reacts a lot less to.
The applicator is messy. I wish the product was little thicker. It got the job done.
It was a good color for me and it goes on very well but it creased under my eyes easily.
This shade comes out yellow, but the other fairest shade comes out red. It has very good coverage but they don't quite have the right color for me. Overall good.
I liked it
I like it, I wish I had it in fair also (for highlighting) its good, it creases a it but I still havent founf a concealer thats doesnt, I combien it with other to create the perfect shade and coverage
My only problem is that it was the wrong color for my skintone, which was my fault. Other than that, I love the texture and coverage when I improvised and mixed it with an nyx concealer. I bought another but this time I made sure it was my color! :)
The first time I bought this I was disappointed because it was too dark on me, but I gave it a second chance and got a lighter color. It worked so well and is the perfect shade for me and covers really nicely.
Very yellow on my skin
I have tried several different brands of concealers I have have to say this is the best one yet.Very good coverage,shade I chose matches my skin tone well.The only tip I can offer is that if you dont set it with some sort of loose powder or setting powder it will settle into the fine lines under the eye area.
I use this concealer everyday as part of my makeup routine. I was hesitant to purchase online, but the color worked out perfectly. This is the second time I've ordered it and will continue once I run out. Good coverage and long lasting.
It's a great product but I just got the wrong color so I use it for more of a highlight then a counselor. But also you have to be more careful becuase it can make you face have cakey parts.
I really like how easily this applies and looks!Four stars while I wait to see how long it lasts.
Great concealer.Recommend trying it. I have no doubt you will like it.
Best makeup line out there!! I have tried several different ones and this is the best and only one I will use from now on. I have and will continue to recommend this to every one I know!!
I got the Maybelline New York Fit Me! Concealer in the color 10 Light.Really great product. The color on the picture seems darker, though. I'm asian, with a pretty fair, but yellow complexion. Works fine, and doesn't cause any break outs or drying (I have sensitive skin). Is not a super heavy product, and the applicator is standard.Great for the price, and better than expected.
PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT
I love this concealer!! I've been looking for the best one for my face. I've tried so many others but they crease and look cakey. No one likes a cakey, creasy face! I just got it today and had to try it out! It is the best concealer I have ever own! And will be the last one I purchase I'm a forever fan!
This product blends on the skin well. Great coverage.
Beautiful concealer. Lightweight. The only reason it has a 4/5 stars is because I had to go over it with a wet sponge after I tried blending it because it looked cakey. But after I uses a wet sponge it looked very natural. Will buy it again for sure
Full coverage perfect concealer great price & love the shade !
Pretty dry and light color
So I purchased this. The color is way too dark. But the part that irritates me is that I ordered this and it came broken. The entire product is cracked all the way down the side. 😞😞
Love this product. I use next to my eye makeup to be sure I have the defined lines. I have purchase several time. Happy each time. thank you
Very drying to the skin, shows wrinkles horribly!!
I have no problem with Maybelline products.  Just hope the color I picked is correct.
Like this product. Contour with this
Amazing! It covers everything up without looking cakey. I wear it to school and it lasts maybe half the day without setting powder, and the whole day with it. But that’s probably because I am very active.
I bought the fair shade because I had purchased the light shade previously and it seems to me that 15 fair is lighter than 10 light.  Either way LOVE this concealer.  It goes on so smooth and it is my go-to concealer.
I like Maybeline especially their lipstick, but this concealer makes me disappointed, it covers not much, i have to apply many times but the result is still not as I expected. It also makes the area under my eyes dry and flaw. I would not recommend!
Its not the best that I have tried but it gets the job done. Goes on smooth and I am able to blend it easily with my foundation. Does require touch ups here and there more than I would like
Make up works good! Good price
This concealer (10 Light) is much darker than I expected.  The concealer itself is a nice.  Reminds me of Tarte Shape Tape. This is good for spot concealing but not for brightening up.  If you are a fair complexion, go with the shade "15 Fair", which is lighter than this concealer (10 Light).
This is my go to concealer its amazing! It's blendable and doesn't feel heavy! Its great!
Ordered "fair".  Should have ordered  "ivory" .  Ivory is the lighter color.
Nothing like a good wand concealer. The color “fair” is perfect for my pale skin. Maybe Kline makes great products and this is one of them
The packaging is very comfortable to apply. It has a light coverage serves for everyday wear makeup. It moves very well in the face. The price seems great.FAIR color is too white, I was wrong to ask that tone, I will use the illuminator.
I like the coverage of this, but it does crease and look bad not long after applying.
Best drug store concealer.
Good. My skin is even lighter than the palest, though! :P Problems of being a redhead.
This has lasted quite long from when I purchased it and blends really well! It matches my tone perfectly and really brightens my eyes.
This is the second one that I bought and it is lighter than the first one so I guess I would have to say they need to be more consistent with the color
Works well but no one said you needed a powder over it for it to stay. It's too creamy and it changes color on my face. Was disappointed, ad it looked like a mess. Embarrassing that I was reapplying every 20 minutes.
Good coverage. I use a shade a little lighter than my skin tone (regularly use Buff Beige) for under eyes and subtle highlighting.
This is my holy grail drugstore concealer!! I have re purchased this concealer so many times and I make sure to always have back ups! It blends very smoothly and does not crease or cake up easily!
I’ve used this concealer for years and have always loved it. It is a nice medium coverage that’s you can build up.
I love this product! It stays on all day and it's the perfect match for Irish skin tone. I chose ivory. A little bit goes a long way so you don't have to put much on
Love this! I had always used expensive Mac concealer before this but I won't go back. This is so much easier to apply and at such a fraction of the cost, I'm a convert. Definitely recommend. The color was just as I expected as well.
This product conceals on a medium level for me. It is very smooth and easily blended. Great for around eyebrow's also. Overall I'm happy with this concealer and I would buy it again!
I bought this to use as an under-eye concealer, but it was too thin/watery. I like thick, creamier products for my under-eye area. However, this is fantastic for cleaning up my eyebrows after filling them in. I've been using this concealer for my brows everyday since I got it. This shade matches my skin tone perfectly so I don't get that awful "halo" effect on my brows. (For reference, my MAC shade is NW45.)
I like this concealer a lot for the first couple hours of use. It really does a lot to brighten up my face and cover my under eye circles. That being said, it only lasts a couple of hours before creasing and then ultimately wearing away. I have pretty dry to normal skin, and even with this skin type, it creases and I would probably give it another star if it didn't.
Good
This came as is shown in the photos and spilled on eeeeeverything. Its a good thing everything else came in packaging and wasnt damaged as well. I’ll just buy in person at the pharmacy next time!
I liked it, my only complaint was the packaging. I got some oily makeup remover on the tube on accident and all the ink on the tube smudged all over my hand, had to remove it altogether.
it is not very good coverage for my dark circle. will try other brand.
This product is amazing, cover well dark spots and imperfections.  Lasts all day. The only bad thing it is too small and you have to buy another one soon.
Great coverage. Smooth and I'd say the only downfall to this is when u run out you can't get to the bottom of the tube to get the last of the product because the wand isn't long enough.
The product came with seal already broken. Afraid to use with current state of things.
Does not dispense properly -- Dispenser cushion falls off -- Does not accept fill
Acceptable product and worth its price.
Covers well I use as Foundation blended out all over face looks beautiful
I like it
Perfect for my pale skin. I use it on the occasional blemish and in the corners of my eyes to brighten. It applies easily with the tip of my finger, and doesn't settle into creases like some others do. Happy with my purchase :]
I just found the perfect one!!!
My everyday and good deal concealer. A little dark for being a "medium" but mixing it with a little bit of moisturizer or lotion lightens and brightens it!
good coverage for the eye area
it's ok, not crease-less, it really didn't help to conceal my dark circles. It does smudge and a bit tacky though not sticky. It's not too drying but I wish it was because it'll certainly smudge less and will stay in place. It is definitely not high coverage, if you have really really really dark circles forget it, this doesn't help but if you have mild dark circles then you should give this a try.
Kind of wears away throughout the day but I don't bother reapplying because that is a pain. I'm switching products for this reason, and also because it creases terribly under my eyes and makes it look like i have wrinkles and I've not had a concealer do that before. It's a great color match for fair skin, though, and provides really good coverage for pimples.
It worth the price
The product was more of a yellow than a pink tone. Otherwise it’s fine.
I have dry acne prone skin and have tried so many different drugstore concealers to cover spots and finally got this one.. And it works! I got mine in the shade light and it's an awesome match to my Ivory Fit Me Dewy foundation. This isn't drying, it covers nicely, blends well and isn't harsh on my sensitive skin.
Will always buy
I LOVE IT.
This is my third time buying this concealer. It’s great for the price. My favorite I’ve had so far
PERFECT dupe for more expensive concealers. Of course, ordering online I always have doubts in picking the "right" color, however I chose perfectly. I plan on purchasing more of this product so I have one in my purse and at home. I LOVE high-end makeup but this will now be part of my daily routine.
I really like this product as it is easy to work with and looks great. It's light weight and doesn't look dry on the face once set. It's buildable coverage. This is my go to always and the price is great.
For reference, shade 15 Fair is lighter than 10 Light. I really like this concealer, it is so creamy and blends really well. It's perfect for under eye as well as blemishes and discoloration. It is medium coverage, and doesn't cake easily.
I had high expectations based on reviews, but I am not blown away by this. The coverage doesn't seem great. As summer ends, I am generally the second to lightest shade in most brands, and the 15 was too light for me. I have read comparisons between this and Nars concealer, and having both, there is no comparison. Given how inexpensive this was, I would be willing to try again with another color.
I like it.
Definitely a knock off product. I don’t feel comfortable using this because unfortunately it isn’t actually a Maybelline product. Compared to the “same” concealer I purchased at a drug store you can definitely tell this is a fake. Not worth returning but I wouldn’t put this anywhere on my face or body. To the trash it goes.
This concealer was highly recommended to me, but I could never find a light enough shade for my skin tone in-store. Thankfully, I checked Amazon! It is not drying, applies easily, and a little goes a long way.
I have no clue as to the "longevity" as I've had it only a short time.  Very pleased with the product though.
This is the best concealer for the money I've found.  It is as good as department store brands at a fraction of the price.  No gray tones as other sometimes have.  The applicator will put it into the deep pockets on either side of the nose where it is hard to get a finger to fit.  I am a repeat user of this product.
It is not the best concealer because it does cake up. Its blends out ok but not the best
The lightest shade is a little bit too dark. The lightest shade of the Fit Me Foundation is a lot lighter, so please extend the shade range.
Dried out, unable to use
This is the best drugstore concealer in my opinion. I have tried a lot of drugstore concealers and I like this the best. I just ran out so I ordered one here on amazon prime and I was not disappointed!
I love it! It helps alot
When it comes to concealer this is hands down my Go-To! I prefer this concealer over many high end brands, and the price point is great too!
This concealer is one of my favorites because it works so well and its not pricey at all, which I love !
My girlfriend wanted it. I only got it so she wouldn't complain about all the stuff I ordered from Amazon. It worked. I dont hear her yelling at me as im installing my TV wall mount bracket. Oh plus she looks good wearing it.. so there is that. I guess what im saying is.. it makes you look good and it was cheap price. Yea.. thats it.
Product was open
Maybelline has come a long way. This concealer is nice on my dry skin. I use a good nourishing eye cream before applying this product. Maybelline makes the top ten list for best drug store concealers.
I’m trying to put more effort into contouring and looking less tired as a new Mom. I am giving this a go and so far so good. I like the consistency, it brightens and blends well.
I use this for acne scars and any other dark spots on my face and it works great! However, I have not tried it for my under eye circles.
I have not tried this product yet but I can't wait to try it out. I am so excited. It will live up to all my expectations.
I like it I just wish it didn't have a white undertone since the color is "deep" otherwise good doesn't crease.
I’ve used this before and liked it but it came a little darker then I remember it being and the seal seemed broken and a little messy, I’m going to hope it was just jostled around during shipping because I don’t want to go through the process to return and replace
I bought two because I love using this instead of a heavy foundation. I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate or cause breakouts.
It is good for the price!I don’t feel that it covers really well the spots in my face!!
Something my woman has used for a long time. True to color and shade described. She's happy with it.
lasted all night and very easy to work with. doesn't cake up like a looot of concealers tend to do and the oxidation is minimal, almost nonexistent 🖤🖤🖤
Lasts long and works!
I would recommend to use this one around your eyes, because it's very gentle and oily, which is good for eye skin.But if you have acne or want to use concealer around your nose I still suggest Maybelline 24HR stay Concealer.It's less oily and MORE pigmented than this one.
Great lil product super coverage.... Doesnt do anything weird to the make up. But def full coverage.
Very comparable to NARS Creamy concealer, pairs VERY WELL with the NARD Radiant Longwear foundation
this concealer is ever so slightly a bit thicker than I prefer but has good coverage.
doesn't cover my dark circles completely but better than anything else i've tried so far
My favorite concealer. I use it all over my face as a sort of foundation/concealer all in one. I get compliments all the time on my skin.
Great concealer honestly, especially for the price. Will buy again.
Was not impressed. Baught 2 shades and they were pretty much identical so my experience was not an enthusiastic one. But it is a value product.
loved this product, super creamy and covered imperfections
Before this one, I have had 25 medium and 15 light.  One was too dark and the other too light.  This one is perfect.  It is also more yellow than the other two, which is perfect for me.  On many days, I use this concealer alone without either foundation or BB cream.
It is waaaay lighter than expected but it blends well, use with a darker concealer and it is perfect.
Okay for its cost, but not a great product. If you have fine lines, I would not recommend.
Can’t beat the price. Love it to put myself together. One of the only few concealers that blends nicely on my skin.
A good concealer, it slathers on exactly in the shade it seems. As many frequent make-up users know, it's difficult to find one product to exactly match your skin tone. Stays evenly throughout the day-- although for more busier women, you might want to take it with you to just touch up at  half-way point.
Definitely puts jade again. It had more quantity than most. Also, it doesn’t dry super quick on face so I can blend in easy. Doesn’t caulk up on skin either.
It turned out to be very yellow and did not match my skin tone at all.
I have been meaning to buy a new concealer for a while now. This one is nice, it blends well and gives great coverage to my eye bags. I figured after the 3rd person to tell me that I look more tired than usual I needed to replace it. :/
small in size and doesnt contain much product but easy to apply and gives a nice finish. just ordered a shade too light but still works for me. i can buy again cause its a good concealer
My girl loves this product, looks good on her, smooth, no lumps or looks dry...
I've tried a lot of concealer and this is one of my favorites. I use it mainly under my eyes to hide dark circles and it covers wonderfully. I used 2 very small "dots" of it under both eyes, blended it and that's it! Circles concealed! I also used it on a few blemishes I have had and it covered those spots great. Super product at a great price.
This blends so easily. My only complaint is that it only provides light coverage but it works well over an orange corrector. It's creamy and doesn't dry out my under eye. I may repurchase this.
As far as drugstore concealers go, this one is great. Creamy, blendable, lasts well and has a nice finish. I wish the color selection were a bit better, but that is my only complaint.
this concealer is amazing, providing good cover, but the color cafe was a shock. I thought it will be lighter but it was really dark, it's resemble Nc40 from mac, I cannot used it even when I'm tanned.
I have always used Cover girl concealer, but I really like how well this product blends in and looks good.
I recommend buying 2 at a time if you use concealer every day. This product is very light, but provides excellent coverage to hide flaws.
I definitely bought this concealer on a whim because of a youtuber who raved about this product so I gave in and decided to try it out and man I am very impressed! I set it with translucent powder and I'm good for the rest of the day. Definitely purchasing again when I run out 👍🏻
I don't really care for it does not cover anything... I've tried different shades in the same brand and they work better but this shade is not meant to hide or conceal anything on your face I wouldn't recommend it
Just a little concerned, when I opened the concealer (yes the sticker was intact) the concealer wand seemed like it had been used. The top is dark and not fresh looking like new concealers normally look.. also, the sticker that has the barcode and the fit me! Logo on it, is on a different side of the tube than in other pictures I’ve seen of this makeup. Makes me wonder if this is even the fit me brand, and if it’s been used?? Not excited about this. The photos I attached are of the makeup product freshly opened and unused!!
I use with product everyday and it is the perfect product for added coverage in the T-zone and spots.  Goes on easily over foundation and stays put.  I order a shade slightly lighter for highlighting nose, under-eye, between brow, Cupid's bow, and  chin.
I've used two of these so far, and the third will be delivered today.  I'm not giving up on the color!  It's been hard to guess at, but I'm just sure this one being delivered will be perfect!! LOL
I don't know how maybelline did it.. But these concealer provides full coverage, doesn't get cakey, or smudge off throughout the day. And it's very inexpensive compared to some more pricey ones I've used, and it works a hell of a lot better.
A little goes a long way, just touch on a little dab and spread. Works well on the dark circles under my eyes.
Great product. I know it’s hard to find that color that is for you but this was pretty easy. Affordable and works well.
Not great but not horrible. I didn’t find this to be full coverage really. For a good coverage concealer on a budget, go for Elf camo concealer.
Great product
It’s a nice makeup but it’s just so hard to find a shade that matches my dark caramel skin tone. This made me look way lighter than I was and didn’t blend well with my skin.
Life changing! Buy it!!
I ordered overnight shipping and when i received it the seal was already broken open and has been open before. The shade number didn’t even match up with what the handle said.
I ordered it in another color but it came in fair. The color fits me though so I have no complaints to that but it smells very strange :\ overall it's ok.
I like it a lot better than a lot of big brand names. Not cakey
Formula works great and the price is even better
I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who doesnt like to spend a lot of money on make up. Works great for a concealer and this color works very well for people with lighter skin. Its small and fits well in clutches to take with you when you go out!
This concealer is okay... I ordered it in the same color as the matte powder and the foundation but I find that the concealer is just a slight bit darker than everything else so I can only use it in a few places on my face. Otherwise, it blends out really well and covers like it should!
The black paint from the tube wears off on my hands and gets everywhere, so I barely use it anymore.
The lightest shade is still a bit too pink for my skin. Overall it's a GREAT concealer. I prefer ones that are more neutral for my pale skin. NARS radiant creamy concealer in the lightest shade is a great neutral concealer for pale skin.
Perfect color
I liked the products container, it’s convinent. But this is the lightest shade and in the picture it looks way lighter. With the pictures taken you can clearly see a major change. I was disappointed since it slowly turns orange/pink.
Okay
This product worked really well however the light shade was a lot darker than i expected.
Lighter than expected, but does exactly what it should. It does last all day too.
The product works great for its purpose. I have a friend who bought the same one and we both noticed it kind of burning under our eyes when we used it to cover dark circles. It could be that we just have broken capillaries, but the product burns.
Love this for my eyebrow clean up. Great coverage.
I love how this looks on me and the fact that it didn't cost that much 👍🏾
I love it, but it didn't come in on time when they said it got delivered. I had to get it replaced.
Works fabulous ..better then Almost all premiere brands I’ve used . Impressed for the price
I must not be drinking the juice on this one.  The concealer I previously used is no longer sold and I can't seem to find anything the really covers things up.  This certainly brightened things up but did little to actually cover things up.  I'm disappointed in all the Pinterest recommendations
I am very pale so I am constantly looking for new concealers that will match my skin tone. This concealer says “light” but it’s literally about 2-3 shades darker than my skin tone. So if you’re pale like me, don’t buy this.
Not the best but not the worst. The tube itself tends to leak a little - just enough to be annoying and smudge up the stuff in my makeup bag but not enough to throw out. Also I find the solution to be a little runny/thin which means it takes a while to blend. For a casual makeup wearer I wouldn't recommend.
ive been using this concealer for years. never lets me down
The consistency is like a liquid. It is a tad looser than I would like. It is also difficult to color match. Overall an OK product. It just depends on what you are look for.
Honestly this concealer is better than most high-end concealers. I've been using it for years for my undereye circles and to hide little blemishes and it's amazing!
It is exactly how the picture displays it but I was expecting it to be at least a little bigger. I’m probably going to use all of this completely after doing my makeup five times.
Okay y'all, I literally never ever take the time to write a review but when it comes to this concealer....TOTALLY WORTH IT!!! I even like it better than my Nars!! Unbelievably smooth and looks amazing on the skin. Also the size is PERFECT!! Definitely buying more. :)
I was hoping to use this as more of a contour color, but I think I just went too light. Product is great though!
I love this concealer!
Easy to use and great for covering small imperfections on skin. Lasts well over the day.
Maybelline Maybelline you are popping with these products lately! I’m in love with this concealer, even on my dry skin. You’ve been a tried and true brand for so many years. It shows! Thanks....
This product has good coverage if you apply  2-3 layers without any eye irritation. Would have given it 4 stars, but after usage the area you open eventually starts to have the product drip on it, which is a bit irritating. Not a good product for traveling or carrying in your purse.
I use this for my eye circles, the coverage is pretty good and it blends well!
I got this to replace another brand of under eye highlighter & it is soooo much better.  The other brand was difficult to get on smoothly.  This goes on super easy & stays in place all day.  I use it around & under my eyes to brighten and hide darkness.  It works great!
This concealer is great! I would recommend it.
Been using it for years!
Great color, good texture. A little thin but good for the price.
some concealers are too dry but this is perfect. I've not switched from this for a few years now. highly recommend it along with their foundation  + powder
A concealer is a concealer. This one, great for the price
Coverage is a little bit lighter than I expected. But overall, very good product.
I wish more joining clips were included. There are not enough to build 4 individual cubes. Cubes must share sides to maximize use of all metal grids. I built 2 cubes and then was out of joining clips. Saved extra pieces. May be able to build a different configuration in future home/apt.
My favorite former Maybelline 24 concealer was discontinued, so I tried this and am quite satisfied. I am very pale and was going to get #10 light, but another reviewer said that she found that #15 fair was actually lighter. That shade was perfect.
Thus far, I absolutely love it. It blends well, no cake. Helps cover-up blemishes and undereye circles. Lasts all day.
It was not sealed or in a sealed box.  Ridiculous! Anything could be in there.
My favorite concealerDoesn’t creased as is affordable
Perfect
my favorite concealer
I have light skin, and sometimes it's hard to find a fair priced concealer that works. I'll include swatched - you can see that it works really well for my skin tone. For this price, any price really, I REALLY recommend this!
Got this as a recommended color from the color match test, and it's the same as my skin tone, so I can't really use it with foundation. If I want to spot conceal on a bare face it's okay.
Good
Love it
My daughter loves this concealer. Had to pick one up for her stocking. She is happy
this product is sooo good, I usually use nars, tarte, smashbox ect concelars. This blows them all away. The coverage is amazing under my eyes and when im not self tanning my under eye circles are very difficult to cover and this really does get it done. Its amazing I love it and it lasts all day doesn't cake up either.
I think it’s okay for the price I would buy it again and it’s a good concealer
I have dry skin, and this would sometimes cause dryness under my eyes even after I apply enough moisturizer.
Color 15 fair... reall surprised at how much darker it was than I anticipated. Maybe I need one to be called ghost white and I'll get it close to her skin tone with the variance in shades lol
Perfect concealer. I am Mac NW40 / L'oreal N4 Buff Beige and this concealer is perfect for my skin tone. I didn't think I really needed concealer but once I tried this product I fell in love with it. I'm not even going to bother trying any other brand for a while!
Good. I love it more than foundation
good condition and easy to use. I use mac nc15 and the shade 20 works perfectly to conceal the dark circle.
I don't know if that is how the product comes, but it was already opened when I got it and when I dip it, it doesn't come much product. To clarify, my package wasn't opened, so no one could've opened it. What I liked was the thickness and how it covers the skin. Also, The image of the shade is lighter in your screen!! choose one shade lighter of the one you think it's right.Would I use this again? probably not
Love it !! I received 2 instead of 1. I already knew my color so I didn’t struggle with that.
When I received it is was in good condition. I bought the lightest shade and when I went to swatch it it was too dark. It will work though. Otherwise covers up very nice!
This is a great formula and price! Disclaimer: this product is only medium coverage it wont completely diminish your dark circle and/or pimples.
It has weird coloring to it, it was too orange for my face and I got one of the lightest shades. The formula is nice though
I have used a lot of different concealer. I don't know exactly how many I have tried but this one is by far the best. It works great to cover blemishes but it also makes the underneath of my eyes look way brighter! I put it under my eyes and I instantly notice a difference! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great concealer and eye brightener!
Purchased this concealer in both a light shade and dark shade for concealing under the eyes and contouring the face. It did a great job contouring. The shade was perfect and it gave nice color payout. However the lighter shade I used for concealing under my eyes was horrible. It barely covered anything and creases horribly. I would purchase the darker color again to use as a contour on my face and that’s it.
Nice. Arrived on time. Does the job well. Will buy again.
My wife looks good without any makeup but she likes it so its worth it! As long as shes happy it's an awesome deal!
It’s ok. Others are better but works in a pickle.
the product smudges on and doesn’t last very long, it doesn’t conceal very well, kind if disappointed. don’t  spend your money on this. Spend your money on the elf concealer.
Great! Love this stuff similar to the Nars, but I actually like this better
I love this concealer! Comparable to high end concealers. Love the coverage and it's all i need plus the maybelline fit me powder. It does not brighten up your undereyes too much but it does cover unwanted spots and most of your dark circles. This is the only concealer that i buy repeatedly
Covers well. I thought it was the lightest shade, but apparently porcelain is darker than classic.
Covered dark circles
I've bought this product countless times. And I really like it. For me, it's comparable to Mac Pro Long Wear, which is WAY pricier. I find this does the job exactly how I like it. At times I'll even use this as foundation.
IT IS TOO DARK FOR MY PURPOSE---I USE IT TO HIGHLIGHT
My very first concealer, so i don't know how is it compare to the other brands. It lasts about 6 hours??? Which is not really really bad. I will repurchase it again and also I will go one shade darker.
This concealer is my absolute favorite. I choose it over all other high-end brands, it’s that good. It’s so creamy and pigmented. Plus, the price is great!
Cannot use it as the soft tip is missing from the applicator wand.
Utter trash. Oily and gross
The right color for me to cover the dark circle under my eyes.My skin type: Asian skin tone. Foundation color is between Cezanne EX1 and EX2. Dry skin under my eyes.
This color is too lite for me. watch out for color match would buy again but in a darker shade
Super blendable. Used it with fit me foundation and it helps conceal under eyes and red areas. Buildable!
Very goo
Great concealer. Beautiful coverage without caking or settling in creases.
Cute. Doesn’t last long though.
I love this concealer it works really well on anything that pops up on my face, it helps so much I usually wear only this and I skip the foundation. It even covers up the dark circles under my eyes.
I really love this concealer. I am dark skinned, kinda like Tyra Banks-y and the caramel 35 Deep matches my skin tone pretty well, and blends PERFECTLY. Stays on all day, and doesn't get all greasy. I must say, I'm impressed ^_^. Also, a little goes a loooong way. I can make a bottle of this stuff last months, even after using on differet spots of my face every day.
I would compare to NARS radiant concealer! Easy to apply and a little goes a long way!
If you're pale (lighter than mac nc15 foundation) the lightest shade of this is not very pale at all and will look orange. It works very well as an undereye cocealer though and I cannot fault it for its performance. Giving a five star because it works well but I still wish online photos could show how dark it really is :/
I ordered the lightest one they had to offer. It has an orange tinge and was darker than my skin. I prefer my concealer to be a bit lighter than my face to highlight certain areas and to make my skin appear smooth against my foundation. My skin is a nice natural ivory color and this did not do it any justice.Do not order if you are looking for a bright light concealer.
I had high hopes for this concealer. Altough, not bad it's not great either. I found it works well on top of foundation and a primer for highlighter/illuminator, but certainly doesn't conceal dark undereye circles. I wear shade 10.
Not very heavy coverage when using it as a cover up
By far the best concealer I’ve tried thus far. It does an excellent job of covering my imperfections and dark under eye circles. I can see myself buying more in the near future 😊
It's ok. not as high coverage as I would like from a concealer, so not ideal for spots but good for under eyes and around the nose. Not as long wearing I would like, but nice natural finish
Been using this for years works good
We'll just have to wait and see how well it will work.
This is a concealer I've used in the past. I bought it in the same shade (10 light) and while it's still the same formula that I like, it's now a shade darker and no longer works for my skin tone.Basically, great product that I would use and purchase again if the color wasn't off.
This is now my number one concealer over the other expensive brands I've bought before. I highly recommend this one if you want a very effective product that will do the trick with very little at a time. This is a narrow container but I see now that very little is needed to do the job so, in this case Ladies, size does not matter...
It didn't give me any coverage at all.
For costing around $5.00 it is an amazing buy, and works better than what I was using , glad I found this!
i have heaaavy under eye circles, its always a problem to hide them, i use tarte bb corrector which is a salmon shade and then i use this concealer on top of it and it works wonders!!!  i also use it to conceal blemishes and dark spots, most of the times i just use this some powder and blush and i am ready to go.
This is really good it’s the only concealer that I use but it does need a good primer under it
Not the best, but gives you a decent coverage. I use it everyday.
Good product. Lasts for a few hours. Smooth coverage.
The only affordable, retail cover up/concealer that comes in Fair and actually matches my fair skin. Doesn't last as long as I'd like
I give this four stars since it does tend to disappear after a few hours on the oily parts of my skin. It stays put under my eyes, but not on my nose.
Decent quality concealer for a drugstore brand product. Blends well but color maybe tricky to match your skin tone. I use it under my baremineral so no big deal if color is lil off. Applicator tip is easy to dab on your skin to conceal zits or blemishes. Staying power is just ok; works best if you use primer and setting powder on top.
I love this concealer so much it's super lightweight
Great for everyday wear. No issues with application. Easy to use w/ a beauty blender.
Giving it 3 stars because it came all scratched up. I don’t like my products being all messed up or beat up.Haven’t tried it yet. Heard good things about it though.
Good for under eyes. Too yellow for concealing acne.
Great. Not too expensive. Comparable coverage to products 10x the price ... Use with FIT ME loose finishing powder for a nice matte.
it does NOT cover my under eye dark circles, feels nice and doesn't cake... but it does nothing for the dark circles under my eyes
Ok...does the job but not really on the darker spots..
LOVE this so much
I normally don't write reviews, but I had to for this one. I breakout a lot. And this does amazing coverage on pimples and especially on my chin for black heads. It works better than any other concealer I've ever purchased. If your hesitant about buying this, I reccomend getting it because you won't regret it.
I have dark circles under my eyes an am constantly searching for just the right product to make them less noticeable.  Although this concealer is not a perfect solution, it does a good job and it's reasonably priced!
Stays on well, does its job.
It’s has a orange undertone
Awesome
I have heard good things about this product, and I decided to just try it. It works fairly well to hide most of my imperfections.
This concealer is good. It's not great, at least in my case at the end of the day I seem a little cakey in the areas I applied the concealer. Also it sometimes burns my skin when I apply it
wonderful coverage and lasts all day.
I really wanted to love this product as many people have raved about how wonderful it it. The formula is great but I found that the color was VERY light and I am extremely fair skinned. I had a hard time blending this out because it was lighter than even my highlighter.
It's very blue toned on me, but it oxidizes and matches me alright after powdering. MUCH fairer than shade 20, though. they work together nicely to make a good neutral tone, but they crease something terrible.
I was pleasantly surprised at how great the coverage was on this. I have dark spots all over my face from three decades of blemishes. It only took a small amount of product to cover my trouble areas. It dried quickly and lasted all day. I would definitely purchase this again.
Ordered the sand color.  Much darker than description.
This product is much darker than I expected. It’s definitely good coverage, but creases terribly on my eye lids when I use it as a base.
It works well but it doesn't last long at all.
This item was used
Absolutely love the pigment and silky feel
This color has a yellow undertone, which I was not expecting! It is darker than the lightest shade of "matching" foundation which threw me off, and it stings under my eyes, which isn't something I normally experience. I will probably not buy this again.
Didnt love the shade but it will do. Amazing product for the price! Some concealers tend to make my skin flaky but this doesnt. Its a keeper!
One of the best drugstore concealers nice coverage, not too much but enough for it to brighten! Its not drying at all but it isn’t oily! Super recommended
Love love love this. If u r looking for a natural look this is IT. No cracking up  or breaking up sooo smooth
Great product and especially for the price!
Works well on my pale skin with neutral undertones.
This stuff is amazing! It's creamy and really great to cover blemishes and under eye. It blends well and the applicator makes it easy to apply.Overall, I'm really satisfied with this concealer! Definitely would repurchase again :)
Good concealer
To clarify, I have hooded lids and I usually just use concealer sticks to prime my eyes. I decided to try my hand at a liquid primer since I never tried one before. The ones I purchased were kind of dry and did not blend well into the color of my skin (and I used a concealer brush at that). It just looked like I ran a miniature paint roller over my eyelids. At that point I didn't bother with shadow, I just wiped it off. And it's not easy to get off, either. I guess I shouldn't have expected much from the beginning, given the price. I'm aware that these work for some people but it most definitely did not work for me.
GOOD AT COVERING BLEMISHES.  SINCE MABELINE TOOK AWAY SHINE FREE--THE ORIGIONAL THIN FOUNDATION, I'M CONSIDERING USING THIS AS A FOUNDATION. IT LEAVES MY FACE SHINY THOUGH. I DONT USE MAKEUP THAT OFTEN SO THE EXTRA COST WON'T BE SO BAD.
Everything is good but the color. Especially it is not the right one for my dark circle. The product is very good.
Works well
This concealer is magical!! I use it with the liquid foundation as well as the powder and it gives my face such a matte look.
Although the Fit Me foundation made my skin itch, this Fit Me concealer gave me no problems.  The product was exactly the correct shade, I have fair skin, and application was a snap.  I have since purchased another of these and would highly recommend you try it.
It’s not to bad
Not sure why but it turns yellow on my skin, under the eyes, so I have to use less of the product and dont get the full effect I want, however on pimples, and such it works great.
Great for the price can’t beat it
A full coverage product.
So smooth and good coverage! Doesn't crease and lasts me all day at work! And I work over grills and fryers! I sweat alot and I'm oily! Still perfect at the end of my shift!
Decent.
Love the consistency of this concealer! Blends in really well, easy to apply. Medium was perfect for me. I wear Fit Me matte foundation and the powder in 220.
Great coverage and no creasing. This is my go to concealer.
I first bought this in the shade medium because I'm not that pale but after buying it in Fair it really covered my dark circles and gave me that highlight I wanted! I now use one for concealer and the Fair for highlight. Great price!
I really like this product, at first it burned when I applied it, but only because I forgot I was wearing an acne topical ointment (my bad). It is the perfect color for my skin and I love the application!
Coverage is fine.  Product is more yellow than I expected.
This price is WAY better than the drug store price (9.99 +). I have tried so many expensive concealers and I always come back to this one.
My favorite liquid concealer.  Place a little under my eyes then spread with my finger, then blend out with a brush.  Works great.
Best affordable liquid concealer.
None
Have been using it for three years now
This is a dewy finish concealer. It's medium coverage, great for dry skin. I use it mostly to hide dark circles under my eyes. It's my favorite everyday concealer.
The quality is higher than my original expectation! It is smooth to apply and does not need to apply more than once a day. I am very pleased with this product!
Work very well for a drugstore product, I recommend it. 10/10
Does the job
Report abuse
This is my fourth one, I'm not only using it as a concealer but also a whole  face foundation. Love it.
easy to use.
Best drugstore concealer!
Best for under eye. Great consistency, color match, and payoff.
Love it
I wanted to love this concealer because I really do love all maybelline’s “fit me” collection but this concealer was a huge no for me. It creases within minutes of wearing it even after using powder to set and setting spray. I applied it how I usually apply my concealer I’ve used other brands that did not crease but this isn’t the one.
I opened the concealer and it’s all dried out like it’s old I’m so disappointed in this product
The brush is similar to a lip gloss brush, which makes it very easy to apply. The product is lightweight enough that it doesn't look cakey, but it still conceals blemishes. It also blends very well.
I like it. Sand is good for yellow undertones. Light is better for peachy undertones. I'm glad they have a sand color available. I like to set it in banana powder. It creases some but let's be honest, they all do on most of us.
Works so well! It’s now officially my go-to concealer.
Not completely full coverage but definitely enough for every day :) My favorite drug store concealer!
Works great, amazing has a good price on this. I replenished mine so I already knew how it performed.
Pretty good for the price. Will buy it again
I'm over 35 and was worried it would sit in tiny lines but it doesn't at all feels very light and sheer yet has good full coverage. I love it lasts all day even through heat and sweat from a summer day.
I bought this one because I had color #10 and I wanted something darker. This one was lighter than I expected because it was lighter than my #10. I guess #10 darkened over time, and since I got this #15 new, it was lighter. Either way it works well!
This is a GREAT concealer! I use it under my eyes to "bake" and its very full coverage and blends easily. I have purchased it multiple times and feel like stocking up prior to Maybelline discontinuing it (which they always do with the best products!)
Lovely concealer. Medium coverage. If you have wrinkles or bags under your eyes I recommend you go light on the application and set it with powder. Always moisturize before putting makeup on!
Love this concealer; it conceals, but doesn't break me out. Could be cakey if overapplied
It's a little watery for me. Decent coverage.
Perfect for me haven't tested it out but the shade is nice, i am indian but not that dark, so this medium shade is great for me
It’s too dark not as described
Been using this for years.  I love this stuff. Covers my dark circles perfectly without caking over my foundation.
SOFT AND CREAMY TO USE -APPLIES EASILY UNDER EYES. I USE IT OVER MY FOUNDATION TO CORRECT THE COLOR. SOMETIMES I HAVE A TAN AND USE THE COMPLEMENTING TAN FOUNDATION COLOR ON ,THEN PUT ON THE CONCEALER TO BRIGHTEN THE UNDER EYE AREA A BIT!
Liquid concealer is best for mature skin. Especially under the eyes. Works great!
Pretty good. There are definitely better makeups out there but I'm happy with the coverage and finish
This toasty cooler blends perfect with my brown skin.
have to set it but great coverage
I love this product and the ease from amazon just adds to how great it is. The price beats any drugstore.
Love this.. hides my dark circles.
I hardly ever wear makeup but I wanted to look more awake so I use a little of this to cover up some of the dark circles under my eyes. It's perfect for my needs, and it was the perfect shade. Great product.
Work very well super smooth and light
works as well as the pricier products
Not that bad
Im glad I found this. This shade is not available in the Philippines. The coverage is good but the formula is thin. Very lightweight. Will definitely buy again.
Cheap, easy to apply and blend, comes in a wide range of colors, fits easy in a makeup bag so you can take it anywhere. I use it mostly to combat redness around my nose, and to line around my lips to give lipstick more definition. Great product!
Very nice product. Good price.
The coloring was perfect and it is so easy to put on your face without any trace - covers up those blemishes really good!
Great product that covers my dark without cracking or looking cakey, the formula it’s light weight and easy to apply.
Received, have not used; but color is ok.
Good value for money. It's a similar product to Nars creamy concealer.
I'm medium-skinned Oriental Asian and use the 25 Medium shade. It doesn't totally cover up puffy under-eye bags, but it does smooth my skin out nicely without looking caked on. I like this a lot and use it every day! The shade is perfect.
I love this concealer, I’m taking a break from the LA Girl ProConceal and decided to try this, it’s creamy, applied really nice and it’s my perfect shade.
The product came opened and the outside of the container was smeared with the product.  This has caused me to be turned off by anything edible, or personal care items, vitamins and other things dangerous if they have been opened and returned sold by Amazon.  I think the product return code should be stricter in order to protect everyone's safety from product contamination
Didn't think it would be darker shade, it was described as like the medium skin color, but this was darker than expected
Liquid is very thin, not much coverage if any
Although this product works well, it somehow manages to get all over everything in the concealer section of my makeup organizer, & anything else that is in my makeup bag with it. It has very nice coverage!
When I put this on it stings before it is blended out. Doesn't matter where I use it. Doesn't cover under eye well.
I bought this to use for my dark circle, it works to cover it, is watery liquid so you don't use aolt of it. Since I did get a lil sun tan over the summer, it is lighter than usual, still works.
Best coverage i recommen.
One of the better concealers I've used to date,
This concealer is ok. It tends to look watery when applied. But it does settle decently. I'd rather use a different brand.
Don’t know much about this but my girlfriend loved it. So recommend it..?
good
Good pigmentation, covers dark circles, not drying, a little can go a long way, good price, BUT do need to set it to make it last all day
It doesn't last long, but for this price is ok. Easy to apply but it just last about two hours.
For anyone saying that the color "10 light" is too dark for them, "15 fair" is actually very paler than that shade. Not sure why this is, but I have both and the difference is very obvious.
It is a bit lighter than I like but I will be able to use it.  Nice feel, price is right.
Doesn’t cover as well as described as it did
Value and price there. Applies easily and does the job
I love the maybelline fit me products. I use it for concealing my dark circle around my eyes
Maybelline always hit at concealer products ! This one is the best over age rewind series if you have dry skin !! Blend like real smooth skin and can be used 3 or 4 months even if you use daily ...
Just like the one I buy at the store.
I have very dark circles due to my fair skin and heredity.  This is the best concealer I've found thus far.  It goes on smooth and the fair color matches my skin tone well.
very smooth concealer. not completely full coverage as my circles are extremely dark, but great product. easy to apply.
I have very dark circles from being ill with Lupus and my medications.  This is one of the few affordable concealers that really works, and blends in well.
I love this so much its creamy and it conceals dark areas&also gives a nice glow! I recommend to set it with a little powder so it would last longer!
It's a good product though and does it's work..
Cheap product. Cheap quality
The only negative thing I have to say about this is that it arrived broken, but still usable. Other than that, I really like the product and the coverage it gives me
I love this concealer. It's not cakey or too light, just right. It's actually good enough for me to not have to use any foundation at all. I apply to trouble spots and blend it out with my fingers. I am definitely getting this one again.
Looks like someone used the product for a while before I received it. Grossed out to try it.
Great stuff.  Dupe for Nars concealer in vanilla and much cheaper.
Got this in the lightest shade they have,  and it is still too orange.  Thought this might finally be a concealer that works for my pink skin,  but alas,  no :( it is fairly invisible on the skin with good coverage,  hence the 3 stars.  Just not my shade.
doesn't stay very long. but i like it better than the nars concealer, which is far more expensive. both this and the nars one are not long lasting though.
Good
I mostly use this product to cut the crease when doing eye shadow. Drys fast and has nice coverage.
The item was not sealed and is scratched up on the outside.
I wish it were a bit thicker.
much better than I thought coverd my acne perfect I love Maybelline fit me their products are good and affordable
"10 Light" on the right and "20 Sand" on the left. 10 light has more warm undertones and 20 sand has more yellow undertones.Coverage is great.
My favorite all time concealer! I can’t find it in stores anymore, so I was delighted to be able to order it online!
Great product.  Easy to apply and does what it is supposed to do...conceal
Works great, I typically use it in the morning just under my eyes and it seems to stay well enough through the day.
10: Fair has been my shade for a lot of years, so I’ve learned the exact look of it. The concealer I received was labeled as 10, but was a completely different concealer that was actually closer to 15.
I use this for contouring. I like the shade but only thing is the scent.. and small amount
Too dry, difficult to blend & too chalky looking for a concealer.
I’m yellow skin tone. Matches! I also mix it with my Kat von D foundation and looks great!
little dark, but good
It works still doesn't fill in lines
I bought 4 of this products and the packages of two of them look like this, as if someone tired to open it or something, and one of it even looks like it’s not full as a brand new one. So weird :( not sure if I should return it
Good
This is a very good under-eye concealer.  Pat it on gently, set with powder, and no touch-ups needed.  You can pay $20 for other brands that are no better than this one.  What a great price!
I was hesitant to buy concealer without seeing it in person, but I've been using this for a couple weeks and I'm in love! The coverage is great and it's not too heavy and goes on smoothly. I love that a little goes a long way and I'll definitely order again.
Had better concealers. Doesn’t work well on blemishes, but it’s sort of good for bags under eyes and circles.
the concealer arrived on time; well packaged; have used it twice and like it
Not the best concealer ever, but certainly not the worst. Not as full coverage as I would really like in a concealer though.
First time I liked the concealer. Maybeline concealer is amazing..concealed my under nicely and the dark spot of acne was covered smoothly. Before using this I was not satisfied with the looks after application. Now I have no worries.
This concealer goes on so well, it doesn't leave dry patches or look "cakey".
It seemed like there was barely any concealer even in the bottle. There are many more concealers that are around the same price that you should spend your time to look into. I wouldn't really recommend this.
Always love this protect! It’s the best and works amazing
Good coverage for my super dark circles.  However it cakes very badly in any sort of wrinkle it can find.  It actually might be making new ones just to hide in.  I swear I looked older by the end of the day and might as not have been wearing makeup.  I gave it one star back for blemish coverage, which it is okay at... not great as it also will cake in any dry skin around the pimple, but covers angry red ones okay.
I definitely think that this product is good for its price. However, coming from more high-end concealers, this formula was much more runny and caused slight irritation/burning when applied. It does provide coverage and is blendable and very buildable.

I hate this concealer, can never get it to come out of the tube and the few times it did, it wasn't anything special.
This is a hard no for me. I’m fair and cool toned and  all the shades lean orange. Also I found it gloppy and the applicator is unhygienic. I had to use a brush or sponge I could wash. I prefer Lancôme or L’Oréal.
I had a SEVERE allergic reaction to this. My eyes constantly watered and burned. The skin around my eyes got soooooo raw I had to buy aquaphor and coat it down for days. This was my experience using this product for one week. Absolutely regretted it
I feel like this product does not do what it says, hence the low rating it gets from my side.Surprised it would even be marketed as anything age-related, as I have found it to cake and crease everywhere and just sit on top of the skin like a clay mask. Maybe it looks good on camera or in photos but to me this has been unwearable because of its thickness.  For the record I use Max Factor pan sticks and other thick foundations and concealers, therefore it isn't the consistency that bothered me, but the effect. I bought two tubes and ended up tossing them both unfortunately. The packaging is also unhygienic and messy (a lot of product gets stuck in the sponge) and this concealer is also not that cheap in Europe. The shade selection is ok I guess, but overall this should perhaps be marketed for younger people as opposed to anyone who wants to 'rewind their age'.
Color match and consistency were good but this formula burned my eye area so badly I had to wash it off immediately. My skin is somewhat but not extremely sensitive and this concealer caused a strong and immediate reaction unlike any other under-eye concealer I’ve ever used. I know it’s a cult favorite but for me it went into the trash after the first use.
I like this concealer quite a bit. The applicator is nice, the sponge makes it easy to apply and blend the concealer evenly. There is a decent shade selection. The sponge does seem like it will be a bacteria magnet, so I use this as much as I can. Never for more than a couple months max. The coverage is medium and not too heavy looking.
The coverage was good but i disliked the packaging. I would never buy it again.
This is my HG concealer. I am yet to find something that is so skin-like, doesn’t accentuate fine lines or look cakey under my eyes. It is seamless.
This is my go to undereye concealer and has been for years. I periodically try others but they always fall short compared to this. This has a light formula, very natural look and they actually make a shade match for my pale cool skin. My undereyes area is nice, no lines and no dark circles so admittedly that makes concealer easy. I actually love the little attached sponge applicator. I apply with that and then pat with a fingertip to blend because it's easy to apply too much if you blend it with the attached sponge. Best concealer I've ever used for my undereye area. Never fails. I'll repurchase again and again. (if you have undereye lines and you put product over them it's going in those lines no matter what, that's not the concealer... It's a physical feature of your face, makeup doesn't cover texture and lines. The more you put and the heavier the formula the more obvious it will be so theoretically this concealer is good for lined undereyes because of its lightness).
I was disappointed. The coverage is not that great, it doesn't look smooth, a bit wet after application, moves and creases lots. Perhaps if u don't have actual dark circles this could work for u
This is my favorite concealer. I bought it in fair, which is a perfect match for my light pink toned skin, I use it on my under eye area, on the inner corners and on any discoloration. This covers beautifully without looking heavy. It doesn't crease or fade or accentuate fine lines. I love the sponge applicator which makes applying very easy. It's very affordable and available everywhere. I've tried high end concealers, but I like this one the best. I highly recommend.
This rocks! It doesn't crease under my eyes, is affordable, and easy to find. I will absolutely repurchase and recommend it to anyone who needs a good undereye concealer. It gives me better results than concealers much more pricy I've bought at Sephora and such.
Good product
This concealer is apart of Maybelline's permanent line and rightfully so. Brightening is a bold understatement. It instantly provides bright lights for your under eyes. This product goes on thin, light, easy to apply and easy to blend and dries down slightly thicker, more full coverage, matte and stays without budging even to touch. There is a reason why it has been around for a long time.
I am nw20 and tried (so many shades, but the new shade worked best) Light Honey. It is decent, but it is not IME for those that have serious darkness under there eyes. Great drugstore in a pinch option. The new shade Light Honey is a much better match for my nw20 skin than any of the other shades they had before. But on me this falls into that category of I keep applying it and it really isn't making a dent. It does some muting, but the darkness is still pretty apparent. Again, if you have just some mild darkness, this would be a great option. But for those of us that have the full under eye, I got punched, darkness...this (again in my experience) may not be enough.
I am sure that my foundation and this concealer has same formular (silicone based) and applied correctly but this foundation still creasing, cakey, and show pores horribly, it destroys my beautiful natural texture of my foundation, coverage is medium and blending is ok, the packaging is unhygine. Sorry if it work for you, not for me. Shade medium is good match for NC/NW30
It has a very good coverage, but also bear in mind that my undereye area is not very dark, it just needs a little bit of brightness. It can be dry, so I put on my eye cream first and then I even use squalane oil on my beauty blender to blend this into my skin without any creases. (I use oil, instead of setting it with a powder, because I do not like matt finishes).
I found the actual concealer to be medium to full coverage and actually found the concealer really good! I actually used mine for foundation and found it good in covering the acne and still providing a non-makeup makeup finish. I would however note that the sponge applicator is not great to constantly be reusing and the actual product finishes quickly for me. However i would definitely recommend over the Maybelline fit me concealer.
Oh hey, you know if you’ve spent any time on Instagram and watch tutorials and see Charlotte Tilbury contour and other high end foundations with this exact way of dispensing then you just know to buy this for $7.00 and save your money. Foundation and concealer in a hygienic easy way of tapping on and having the same affect as CT and Armani. Swatch it, you’ll see ! Happy 2020 you beautiful people ❤️ EDIT if this is balling up then you’re using too much. If you find the sponge to be unhygienic then take it off and wash it, but really a doe foot is not terribly hygienic either or fingers. This is a no brainer for touch ups. ❣️❣️
Tbh this is overhyped. It settles more into my fine lines than the apieu moist creamy concealer, and has less coverage to boot. It's also more expensive. The only plus is that it's far more accessible than most Korean makeup brands, but I'd rather take the trouble to order something online that's cheaper and I know works better 🙃 I find many Korean roadshop concealers have bomb coverage, and frequently come with added SPF - which can only be a plus for preventing dark marks from getting any darker!
Maybeline has finally introduced this in Japan and I`ve been wearing this concealer for the first time for the last two weeks. It`s quite nice, for the price. Good points: high coverage with just a tiny bit of product, won`t settle (too much) into fine lines (if you use a tiny bit of product), good color range, decent staying power. The bad points, as everyone else, has already said: the stupid sponge tip applicator and the fact that it can be a bit too drying (this can be mediated if you moisturize the under eye area really well and use just a pinhead amount). I still like my Phyto Sisley and Cle de Peau (the one in the clicky stick with the brush) concealers better and will always pick those up for a special evening, but those are way more expensive, so to give my wallet a break, I don`t much mind using Maybeline on a daily basis. In summer, though, Catrice Camouflage will beat all other concealers, hands down.
Good medium coverage, creamy formula that is easy to work with. I use this both for under-eye circles and for blemishes on my face (different shades though of course!). Will rub off a bit throughout the day, for longer wear I'd recommend some primer & setting powder to get it to stay put on oily skin
I have not been a fan of under eye concealers because they usually settle into my fine lines...but this concealer has changed my mind. This stuff is a miracle! It actually tightens my undereye area, completely covers darkness and brightens my eyes like nothing else. I am just amazed. I don’t apply heavily but just dab my finger onto the sponge and then lightly around my eyes. It doesn’t require setting with powder and lasts all day. And the price is just awesome as well. I have the Light color which is perfect for my light to medium warm/neutral skin tone. I will be buying this for ever. Maybelline, please do not cancel this product.
I have tried this many times over the years since it was new. I have aged, my skin has changed etc, and I have used the neutralizer, the brightener, and the shade light - each on their own and in combinations when inclined. I never liked these. (Perhaps I should specify that I have never liked an under-eye concealer.) I simply kept giving it a shot with hope and different products underneath etc to see if maybe I would love it. These always flat out suck. Thick, cakey and if tweaked to be otherwise? Disastrous looking. Just putting it in print that not all "holy grails" on cosmetic platforms are always worthwhile.
There is definitely a lot of hype for this concealer, it is all over YouTube and the internet. I remember trying this out a long time ago and not liking it for some reason. I got the lightest available in Walmart which was 100 Ivory which is a pretty good match, is a little yellow though and does a great job with brightening despite not being lighter then my skin tone and concealing my undereyes. Not full coverage more of medium- high medium but still covers a good amount of discolouration. I really like how easily this blends compared to the Creamy Concealer by Maybelline which I have to work a little for it to blend, this one blends effortlessly with just a couple of pats with a sponge.
This is interesting. Ive used this concealer years ago when it first came out and what called my attention was how full coverage it was. Now years later I tried it again and it is more watery, has less coverage (Medium at best), but i find it much more moisturizing and actually helping with dark circles...i know shocking. So for aging under eyes I find it great now. Recommended!!
Yeah i dont know why people are so into this, even Tati recommended this and i thought i should try. One of the worst ones i've tried, it started to roll off in nasty bits from my skin right when i was applying it, and then after just few hours i tried to touch up and it did it again!
I didn’t like the sponge applicator. Good creamy concealer for everyday use. Will buy again.
This concealer has a lot of hype around it, which to some extent is justified. It applies nicely, blends well and looks much like skin when dried down, unlike some products which cling to every bit of texture. I would call it a satin-matte finish - not so matte that it dries your skin but is in no way radiant.
I don't like this. I know it's really popular, and I feel like I must be missing something. I actually even repurchased it a year or two after having thrown it away, thinking I must have had a bad one, or that maybe I had to work with it a bit. No, still don't like it. It makes my undereye area look horrible. I tried the brightener or whatever it's called once, and then I tried it in fair. I didn't like either. I could not make it work for me. Not as an undereye concealer or for any other use. Really unflattering, and under the eyes, very aging. I'm not bothered by the applicator. I love Maybelline, I find a lot of their foundations to be really good. And their Fit Me! concealer and powders are wonderful. But this is really a pass for me.
if you wanted Emily today's video is
gonna be to review all in Milan I'm
gonna be wearing half of my face to
Mabley foundations so on the website I'm
gonna be wearing the cool favorite at
fit me matte and poreless foundation I
love this foundation because it's light
medium coverage it looks like skin on
your skin it's great if you have oily
skin if you have dry skin I would mix it
with the other ones they have deep do me
one definitely recommend mixing these
together with your great is the combo
even if you have oily skin which I do
have so love this one highly recommended
it's like very very popular for a good
reason but you just came out with this
foundation this is the super state full
coverage foundation and this one has
more coverage and it's a little bit
different and I wanted to wear both of
these on half off my face all day long
so you can see them in action because
it's always great to hear a review but
it's even better if you can see it in
person so I'm gonna be applying both of
these with Beauty blenders basically I
just personally like using sponges
because it gives you the most natural
finish if you want more coverage you can
always lose a brush so on my right to
your left I'm going to be applying the
fit me foundation the colors I have like
my summer shades so they will be a bit
dark for me but we're just gonna blend
that until my neck and pretend
everything is okay
should have zoomed you in but you'll see
the final result
can Nestle seed align the middle of my
face but you can see I did have a couple
of like redness and it covered
everything pretty well you can still see
beauty marks so it's not like full full
coverage but it covered everything that
I really wanted to cover but if I had
like a breakout or something I could
just use concealer wherever I need it
but everything else still looks like
skin that's why I absolutely love it
probably why everyone seems to love it
and it's great it kind of has eight like
Demi matte finish I will be setting it
with powder just because it's what I
usually do it and want to make sure that
my own skin
doesn't make the test result just effect
immediately so on my other face but half
of my face I've been buying this one I
try to go and get to color that was the
closest to it but spoiler alert it does
oxidize so this one will be at first
lighter and hopefully it will be so my
close to it once it oxidized I just
wanted to mention by the way the
packaging they're very similar but are
we so so happy that they came out with a
pump like this should have had a pub
like I wish hopefully they will add a
pump to this foundation because it's so
great but it's such a to just try
and pour it on your head and then put it
on my face so I really appreciate that
they finally added a pump I will be
doing it close-up so you can see
difference in texture of foundations so
the newest full-coverage one is thicker
almost like a a little bit moosie
consistency and me fit me is definitely
a lot more liquidy so we're gonna try in
a cover I do have a little bit of
redness and a few breakouts so we'll see
the coverage but yes again warning at
first it's gonna be way lighter I didn't
mention definitely I have this shade at
125 and in this one I have the shade 120
I'm gonna add a swatch on my hands so I
can wait a few minutes and then swatch
it again so we can see how much oxidize
and how the color compare once they are
oxidized so I can show you that how the
colors compare and i will be swatching
this one to you but this one doesn't
oxidize so not a problem here so I'm
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to
show you but basically I like that the
coverage of this one is more natural
they fit me actually I should hold them
to the foundation as I'm talking about
it so this side has a little less
coverage but it also looks very very
natural I don't feel like it emphasizes
my pores as much but I do have two eye
patches around my nose it's the winter
so my skin will tend to have dry patches
around my nose and I do think that this
is emphasizing it which is why I
personally recommend to always mix it
with the other version I feel like it
makes the like perfect foundation
because this one doesn't emphasize three
patches whatsoever so if you have dry
skin definitely recommend it but this
one I do like it except around my nose
the super stay at full coverage
foundation definitely has more coverage
and I don't feel like this emphasizes
the dry patches around my nose as much
however I do think it emphasizes the
pores a little bit more right here where
they tend to beep I mean most humans
tend to have them right however I do you
think you can easily fix that by
applying either a pore primer or even
just when I find my powder in a second
you'll see they does tend to help lower
them a little bit more but if you don't
like to use powder in general I just
thought I would throw it up there so so
personally I think there's some positive
and negatives about both of these
personally I kind of find a solution
pretty easily especially whenever it's
something is so affordable I tend to try
and just find a easy fix that makes them
worth it so for this one for example
like I said just the poor primers and
powder you're good to go
and this one which is the reason I only
have my summer shade I tend to use this
during the summer because it does help
control the oils and during the summer I
don't have two eye patches so I don't
have to deal with it during the winter I
just usually mix it with this one which
is why this one is like super light I
have the shade 110 so I either reuse
this on its own or mix them together and
I feel like it makes it perfect combo
that doesn't emphasize the dry patches
so other than that you can see the
coverage is really good on my forehead
it's not perfect but I usually don't
tend to go for like super full coverage
on a daily basis so I think these are
perfect for that it covered mostly
everything you can see you can see a
little bit of redness on this side to
fit anyone does it have as
coverage button on the forehead it's
still pretty good you can see by the way
that the colors are pretty much matching
now in my face because it has oxidized
all my hand is gonna take a little
longer because it's a little thicker but
so if you were wondering if you have 125
120 will match you once it's oxidized so
okay so I did do the rest of my makeup
there's actually oil coming so if you
like that I like coming but I wanted to
show you what the foundations look like
with the powder and everything on top so
I'm gonna zoom you and kind of like I
have mentioned I don't think the powder
changes the fact that it doesn't besides
dry patches the pores are pretty much
you know normal to gone looking and this
side I do feel like the pores are a
little less visible once you powder but
I mean we all have pores right so I
don't really blame the foundation and
again like I said using a pore primer if
you are really looking to a poreless
look can definitely fix that issue and I
don't feel like it emphasizes my dry
patches as much now the foundation you
can see it's fully oxidized now so I'm
gonna apply it you like fresh swatch
next to it so you can see how much it
does oxidize it yeah so you can see it
is pretty oranjee compared to the shade
it was but if you keep that in mind I
don't think it's DUP difficult to find
your shade and I'm gonna swatch the
other one next to it just so you can see
cuz I do think that 125 looks pretty
close to 120 of the full coverage once
it's socialized so you can see it's good
in the middle I guess although the
foundation is quite thick there I don't
feel like on my face there's a
difference between the two right now so
so I'm gonna go on with my day and I
will be updating you probably once
before the energy day is currently 10
o'clock in the morning so I will be
wearing this for at least 10 hours and I
wanted to mention that I do have really
oily skin although during the winter
it's not as bad but around like five or
six hours it's usually when I have to
retouch the powder and everything so I
will be doing that I hope be doing that
on camera whenever I feel the need to so
it's nothing like the foundation are not
responsible for that it's definitely
just me having very oily skin in general
but again I will update you to zoom ins
and everything and keep you updated so
you know how I said I would come back in
like five six hours touch it up that
didn't happen
because I do not need to I don't know if
it's because it's winter my skin hasn't
been as oily it's legit than ten hours
it's like eight o'clock at night and I'm
just starting to feel shiny and seeing
some changes there's a reason this is a
Holy Grail foundation and why I've been
like dying to talk about this one
they're just really great I do however I
want to say that since I didn't touch up
the powder whatsoever and I'm starting
to boil II I've noticed that this side
is a little more cakey into my pores
which again makes sense as I did notice
that from the beginning the dry patches
are the same it hasn't become more
drying and I do feel like I'm a little
bit more oily on this side than this one
so hopefully you can see it but I feel
you can see my Porter a little bit more
on this side than this one and I do you
feel like I'm a little bit more oily
that's definitely harder to see but it's
just how I feel right now so really I
love both fun they shouldn't do both
favorites I do think they have like you
know their pros and cons but I wanted to
try and reapply I don't have any paper
to remove the oil so I'm just gonna use
toilet paper classy I'm just gonna try
to remove some oil and just see / show
you how they perform
after being reapplied because it's
always nice to see that the foundation
doesn't become cake you and your reply
but I can't already know but I just want
to show you so I'm gonna be here
applying some this batter on top so for
the pores after applying I feel like
this one is definitely a less visible
this one a little bit more and I've
noticed now I don't know if if I've been
touching my face that definitely happens
but I feel like this side might be a
little bit more uneven like little bits
that might have like separated and moved
around a little bit more than this side
I said this one is still perfectly even
personally I'm finding I'm keeping on
wearing at both of these foundations I
think they're really fantastic do real
affordable I think they're really great
if you want something that is a little
bit more lightweight a little bit less
coverage but doesn't emphasize the pores
whatsoever this one if you want
something with a little bit more
coverage and even if you have dry skin
maybe just moisturize probably
beforehand but I would also give this
one a shot usually full
race relations and Dreskin don't go well
together but I think this one would be
totally worth the shot you might want to
touch up the powder a little sooner with
this one so it doesn't become a little
patchy but I mean I've been wearing it
for 10 hours like if it lasts in hours I
don't complain so that's guys I hope you

hey guys and welcome back to my channel
so today's video is going to be a
foundation review over the past few days
I've been trying out too this foundation
the foundation I'm talking about is the
maybelline superstay full coverage 24
hour foundation apparently this is a new
and improved formula they used to
actually have this foundation but I
never tried it when they used to have it
they just continued it and now they
brought it back and it's supposed to be
a better formula so unfortunately I
don't have the old formula to compare it
to so everything is just based off of my
opinions and thoughts on the new and
improved foundation but I was so excited
to see that Maybelline was coming out
with another foundation or a new
improved version because I love
Maybelline foundations the Maybelline
fit me matte and poreless is fabulous
and I also love Maybelline concealers as
well as far as complexion products go I
feel like Maybelline usually hits the
nail on the head and they usually have
really great products so I was super

that being said let's get into the video
so before we go into the first day that
I tried it and my first impressions upon
application I realized I forgot to
mention a couple things so I wanted to
let you guys know the price of this and
also how many shades are in the range
all right so this retails for $11.99 on
Ulta calm I picked mine up on Amazon for
about $10 so I guess it just depends on
what retailer you go to but it's around
10 to 12 dollars and it looks like it
comes in 16 shades the shade that I
picked up is 112 natural ivory so I just
wanted to mention those couple things
and now we'll move into my first day
with this product and my first
impressions upon application and then I
will show you guys the before and afters
over a couple of days and then I will
have my final thoughts at the end of the
video so let's get into it this
literally just came in the mail like an
hour ago I ordered it on Amazon so it
came in two days
thanks to Prime I love it by the way if
you hear something in the background I
am doing laundry today is a super chill
day I'm in my black t-shirt my hair is
up I'm just trying to catch up on some
chores and clean up a little bit so
please excuse the outfit and the hair
it's just one of those days but I
thought I might as well make use of the
day and do a foundation review
especially since this arrived I'm so
excited I'm gonna be trying out the
maybelline superstay full coverage
foundation this is supposed to last up
to 24 hours there's 1 fluid ounce in
here Shea that I got was 112 natural
ivory I ordered on Amazon again so I
hope that this matches me it seemed like
it was gonna be a good match so let me
just read you some of the things that it
claims to do so it's a full coverage
foundation up to 24 hours of wear a
seamless matte finish it's breathable
and comfortable its fade and transfer
resistant its oil flea and oil-free yeah
it's oil free and doesn't clog pores and
it's dermatologist tested
alright Maybelline the first thing that
I have to say about this I'm so excited
about it has a pump I'm so happy about
that let me show you this up close so
here's the packaging it's a really sleek
white cap with a really nice glass
bottle again the white pump which I'm so
thrilled about thank you so much
Maybelline because the Maybelline fit me
does not have a pump and I really feel
like I waste so much product with that
so I'm so glad there's a pump with this
so let's get right into it
I didn't prime the skin with anything
but I do have a moisturizer on I just
barely washed my face and did my normal
skincare routine and so I just haven't
washed riser on but it kind of sunk into
the skin so I feel like my skin is
really prepped and ready for this
foundation so I'm going to start with
one pump on the back of my hand ooh this
shade looks like it's going to work I
hope it does I'm gonna try it out with a
brush on one side and a blender a Beauty
Blender a brush on website and a Beauty
Blender on the other side ok again so
excited ooh
as I'm spreading this out on my hand it
feels super smooth just going to dot it
around and since it's full coverage
let's see how much this does so I'm just
going to take my brush
[Music]
okay
it's starting to blend out like butter
and the shade yeah yeah so excited about
the shade I was looking forward to try
this foundation as soon as I heard about
it it's because I love the Maybelline
fit me foundation and so I have high
hopes for this let's hope it performs
well okay hello off of my very very
first impressions on half of my face
with a brush
I love the coverage it feels really
lightweight and the finish is perfect
oh it's like a seamless matte finish but
it doesn't like dry you out it's kind of
like moosie almost I'm just going to tap
a little bit more on the areas that I
want more coverage and blend down the
neck so again I did one pump on half of
my face look at that coverage I mean
like look I hope that this is a long
wearing foundation because seriously
that is beautiful that is so beautiful
on the skin alright so let's try the
other side of the face I'm gonna do one
more pump the texture is so crazy I'm so
happy about the finish in the shade I'm
glad that it matches me I have a feeling
if this works out for me you guys this
could be my new favorite drugstore
foundation I feel like that's kind of a
stretch right now since I'm just barely
trying it lets blend this out with the
sponge on the side and see how it works
guys look at the coverage on that didn't
you see the redness and the acne that I
had and I love how it doesn't look super
cakey
so my first thoughts about the Beauty
Blender side I actually kind of like how
the brush side applied this time usually
it is beauty burner that usually wins
but I don't know what it was maybe it's
just the formula I feel like it worked
really beautifully with a brush the
sponge site looks really nice too
huh both sides look really good I don't
know but I kind of liked the application
with the brush better typically I apply
foundation like with a brush first and
then I Pat it out with a sponge anyway
so I usually use both okay
I am so impressed by the coverage of
this the finish of this so far
super good I'm going to go ahead and
finish up my makeup if I scoot up a
little bit can you guys see you a little
better hopefully it's not too washed out
but that finish is so beautiful you
wouldn't know that I had acne and
redness and scars underneath this
nation I feel like it looks so good so
I'm gonna finish up my makeup really
quickly and then I'll be back to do a
little check-in and then we will see how
this works throughout the day okay so I
just finished my makeup I didn't do
anything crazy cuz I'm not really going
anywhere today and I really wanted to
focus on the foundation so I used a lot
of cream products actually which blended
over the foundation beautifully I felt
the foundation has kind of a powdery
finish so I only set my under eye
concealer and tiny bit down the center
of the face because that's where I tend
to get oily but I really left the rest
as is I really want to see how this
wears throughout the day because it is
kind of more of a matte powdery finish
off the bat I wonder if it gets a little
bit more dewy towards the other day or
if it stays like this for hours and
hours I have to say I'm so in love with
the finish right now I really hope that
this wears out the day well we will see
so this is a little bit late for a
foundation review to begin just because
I did receive it in the mail this
afternoon so it is currently for 43 but
I'm just gonna keep doing my chores
around the house and I do usually go to
bed kind of late so I'm gonna try to
wear this as long as I can tonight and
then I'll also be wearing it tomorrow so
we can kind of get a better idea of how
this works let's hope that it looks
really good and that'll last a while
I'll check in in a few hours alright so
I am back it is currently 1113 p.m. so
I've had this on for around 6 hours now
I must say especially from far away I'm
really impressed if I'm super picky
about it and I go really up close the
only thing that I'm noticing is it's
getting a little bit of a sheen on the
forehead like but not like oily just a
really nice glowy sheen and then my
pores are a tiny bit accentuated right
around my nose area here which could
probably be fixed with like a good
primer or a pore filling primer I'm so
impressed at how it stayed on the side
of my face because a lot of times
throughout the day I touch my face and
that's where I have the most redness and
acne scarring and so the fact that
there's still coverage like full
coverage there is really impressive yeah
if I'm not being nitpicky and I'm just
looking from far away I have a really
nice natural Sheen to my face and I
really really like the finish still one
thing that I've noticed that I'm really
impressed by as well is around the nose
area a lot of times a lot of foundations
look really weird by the end of the day
around my nose and this one like it
doesn't look as fresh as it did when I
first applied it obviously but it
doesn't look crepey and it didn't crease
I'll stir around my smile and I have one
smile line right here that it creases
pretty bad and it's like not even bad at
all compared to a lot of foundations
that I love and we're so so far so good
you guys as always I love to wear these
foundations that I try out for you guys
for a few days so I'm gonna be wearing
it again tomorrow and the next day and
as many days as possible until I post
this video so I have a really good
accurate review for you so that's the
first day that's my first impressions
I'm gonna try it a little bit different
tomorrow and I'll let you guys know but
yeah so far so good I have really high
hopes for this foundation and the fact
that it's drugstore makes it that much
better so I will see you all tomorrow
for another check-in all right you guys
it is day two of me trying out this
foundation it's another like laid back
running errands type of day this time I
set the entire face with translucent
powder but I didn't use a primer I just
used moisturizer so I'm gonna do another
check-in today it is currently 148 I'm
gonna be running errands when I go to
the grocery store and stuff like that so
I'm gonna try to wear this as long as
possible again and then check in with
you guys and see what setting the entire
face will do by the end of the day so I
will see you later I already started
filming and I realized my mic was off so
that would have been bad okay alright
I'm back all right so it's 825 825
haven't even looked at my face all day
long my nose there's some foundation
missing because I made a spicy soup
tonight and every time I eat spicy food
I love spicy food but like it makes my
nose run so I was I wiped my nose anyway
let's take a look at the foundation I'm
kind of seeing the same thing that I saw
yesterday there's a really nice sheen it
doesn't look very oily I mean I'm kind
of my forehead kinda looks a little bit
oily and today again I powdered the
entire face but I honestly I haven't
touched up all day I ran errands and
this is what it looks like I don't mind
it I feel like it'd be really easy to
touch up the thing I do like about it
that I've noticed the past couple of
days of wearing it is even though it
does kind of develop a dewy finish it
doesn't ever separate on my skin which
sometimes if that happens throughout the
day if my skin gets a little oily
sometimes it causes the foundation to
break up so I do like that it doesn't do
that and it would be
easy just to kind of take a blotting
sheet or some powder and just kind of
dust over the t-zone or wherever you get
oily
I don't mind it getting dewy on the
outer parts of the face I think that's
really beautiful but usually like this
area this area I don't love for it to be
shiny but I mean this is a good what six
hours of wear so I think that's pretty
good I think it's really come off my
skin except for around my nose where I
touched it but I do already notice and
really appreciate that about the
foundation so that is the situation
before today it's kind of funny I wonder
if because it's marketed as a matte
foundation and because at the beginning
of the day it kind of does feel really
matte and really tight
I'm wonder if on my skin my skin kind of
like over produces oil because it is
trying to mattify that could just be my
skin type I don't know so I want to kind
of try to test it out again with maybe a
primer that can combat a little bit of
oil in the t-zone but so far honestly
really liking this foundation the fact
that it's drugstore is that much better
I will do my final check-in tomorrow
with you guys and then kind of do an
overall review and give you guys my full
thoughts on this foundation so I will
see you guys tomorrow all right you guys
so I've had the chance to wear this for
several days now and I think I'm ready
to give a final review so honestly I
really do like this foundation the fact
that it's drugstore makes it that much
better I will say it looks so flawless
upon application it is what I'm wearing
right now the coverage is incredible if
you're into full coverage foundations I
would recommend grabbing this the only
thing that I'm unsure of is if you have
dry skin just because some of the areas
if I do have a little bit of dryness it
kind of clings but my skin is not that
dry right now so I'm really not able to
give a full review as far as dry skin is
concerned that's the only unfortunate
thing about doing foundation review
sometimes is I can only give feedback
based off of my skin type which is
normal combination so sometimes I do
have dry patches right now I don't
really have too many so I can't really
tell you and then also like I mentioned
I think earlier for some reason by the
end of the day this foundation looks a
little bit dewy on me and since it's
supposed to be a super matte full
coverage foundation that kind of like
threw me off it's not dewy in a bad
and sometimes on my skin if I use
products that are to mattify
it actually can increase the oil
production in my skin because my skin
feels so dry and it's like trying to
hydrate or rehydrate itself so I found
that with some products that are super
mattifying that that does happen and so
that may be what's happening with me I
don't know though if somebody has oily
skin and you've tried this new and
improved version of this foundation
would you please leave a comment down
below and let me know if that happens to
you on oily skin or if it really does
help control the oils because it ends up
looking do a baby in a day it didn't
look early though I guess I should say
that so it didn't look greasy it just
looked dewy which I personally don't
mind on my skin type but it was kind of
surprising just because when you first
apply it it kind of feels powdery and a
little bit heavy and a little bit tight
on the skin at least for me and then by
the end of the day it was just kind of
like more dewy and radiant and kind of
had a different finish than when I
started so that's what I've noticed as
far as the finish goes as far as like
the wear time I have not seen it fade
away and that's one thing I really do
love about this foundation is because a
lot of times especially around like my
chin area where I do have blemishes and
acne scarring some foundations by the
end of the day can wear off their
because I do kind of rest my hands on my
face I touch my face a little bit and
this did say it was transfer resistant
which I didn't actually test should I
test that let's take my shirt hey guys
I'm not like wiping but if you just
leaned up against something it didn't
come off of my black shirt so I think it
is transfer resistant that was a fun
little test but what was he saying Oh a
lot of other foundations tend to kind of
fade away around my acne scars and this
one really didn't I found that it had
full coverage throughout the entire time
that I was wearing it so I really did
like that the only time that it broke up
was a little bit around my nose but
overall I really do like the finish of
it again though I am a super-duper fan
of full coverage foundations especially
full coverage matte foundations or semi
matte foundations so if you are too I
would recommend picking this up again
that is just based off of my skin type
I'm curious to see what you guys think
about it if you do try it out please let
me
but I do think I will continue to wear
this and keep trying it out in different
tutorials and keep trying it out with
primers and things I didn't really
notice too much of a difference when I
use different kinds of primers as far as
how at war and as far as like how it
looked at the end of the day I will say
when I set my entire face it looked a
little bit less dewy than it did when I
didn't do that but it still like looks
dewy whether I powder the entire face or
whether I don't do that so those are my
thoughts as far as priming and setting
goes so in a nutshell I would recommend
this foundation I'm not sure if I would
recommend it to people with extremely
dry skin just because it is a little bit
more of a mattifying powdery finish
foundation which could accentuate some
dry patches if you do have some I would
recommend it it's drugstore it's twelve
dollars or less and it's worth a shot
so that's everything in a nutshell I
really do like this foundation on a
scale of one to ten I think I would put
it at a seven and a half maybe something
to have to eight just because it does
change finishes on me so that doesn't
mean that I would have to kind of powder
the t-zone if I wore it all throughout
the day to kind of control the oils in
that section but other than that I feel
like I can really trust it to last all
day which I really do like so seven and
a half / eight stars out of ten that's
how I feel and it's a great price so
thanks again for watching you guys
please as always be sure to leave a
comment down below letting me know your
thoughts on this foundation if you've
tried it also if you guys have any
recommendations for me to try like other
foundations for me to try out and review
please comment those down below because
I love to test out foundations so much
it's one of my favorite things to do
don't forget to enter my 100,000
subscriber giveaway if you haven't
already because it's almost over so you
don't want to miss out I think that's
everything I will see you all in my next
video love you boy
f you wanted Emily today's video is
gonna be to review all in Milan I'm
gonna be wearing half of my face to
Mabley foundations so on the website I'm
gonna be wearing the cool favorite at
fit me matte and poreless foundation I
love this foundation because it's light
medium coverage it looks like skin on
your skin it's great if you have oily
skin if you have dry skin I would mix it
with the other ones they have deep do me
one definitely recommend mixing these
together with your great is the combo
even if you have oily skin which I do
have so love this one highly recommended
it's like very very popular for a good
reason but you just came out with this
foundation this is the super state full
coverage foundation and this one has
more coverage and it's a little bit
different and I wanted to wear both of
these on half off my face all day long
so you can see them in action because
it's always great to hear a review but
it's even better if you can see it in
person so I'm gonna be applying both of
these with Beauty blenders basically I
just personally like using sponges
because it gives you the most natural
finish if you want more coverage you can
always lose a brush so on my right to
your left I'm going to be applying the
fit me foundation the colors I have like
my summer shades so they will be a bit
dark for me but we're just gonna blend
that until my neck and pretend
everything is okay
should have zoomed you in but you'll see
the final result
can Nestle seed align the middle of my
face but you can see I did have a couple
of like redness and it covered
everything pretty well you can still see
beauty marks so it's not like full full
coverage but it covered everything that
I really wanted to cover but if I had
like a breakout or something I could
just use concealer wherever I need it
but everything else still looks like
skin that's why I absolutely love it
probably why everyone seems to love it
and it's great it kind of has eight like
Demi matte finish I will be setting it
with powder just because it's what I
usually do it and want to make sure that
my own skin
doesn't make the test result just effect
immediately so on my other face but half
of my face I've been buying this one I
try to go and get to color that was the
closest to it but spoiler alert it does
oxidize so this one will be at first
lighter and hopefully it will be so my
close to it once it oxidized I just
wanted to mention by the way the
packaging they're very similar but are
we so so happy that they came out with a
pump like this should have had a pub
like I wish hopefully they will add a
pump to this foundation because it's so
great but it's such a to just try
and pour it on your head and then put it
on my face so I really appreciate that
they finally added a pump I will be
doing it close-up so you can see
difference in texture of foundations so
the newest full-coverage one is thicker
almost like a a little bit moosie
consistency and me fit me is definitely
a lot more liquidy so we're gonna try in
a cover I do have a little bit of
redness and a few breakouts so we'll see
the coverage but yes again warning at
first it's gonna be way lighter I didn't
mention definitely I have this shade at
125 and in this one I have the shade 120
I'm gonna add a swatch on my hands so I
can wait a few minutes and then swatch
it again so we can see how much oxidize
and how the color compare once they are
oxidized so I can show you that how the
colors compare and i will be swatching
this one to you but this one doesn't
oxidize so not a problem here so I'm
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to
show you but basically I like that the
coverage of this one is more natural
they fit me actually I should hold them
to the foundation as I'm talking about
it so this side has a little less
coverage but it also looks very very
natural I don't feel like it emphasizes
my pores as much but I do have two eye
patches around my nose it's the winter
so my skin will tend to have dry patches
around my nose and I do think that this
is emphasizing it which is why I
personally recommend to always mix it
with the other version I feel like it
makes the like perfect foundation
because this one doesn't emphasize three
patches whatsoever so if you have dry
skin definitely recommend it but this
one I do like it except around my nose
the super stay at full coverage
foundation definitely has more coverage
and I don't feel like this emphasizes
the dry patches around my nose as much
however I do think it emphasizes the
pores a little bit more right here where
they tend to beep I mean most humans
tend to have them right however I do youf you wanted Emily today's video is

difference in texture of foundations so
the newest full-coverage one is thicker
almost like a a little bit moosie
consistency and me fit me is definitely
a lot more liquidy so we're gonna try in
a cover I do have a little bit of
redness and a few breakouts so we'll see
the coverage but yes again warning at
first it's gonna be way lighter I didn't
mention definitely I have this shade at
125 and in this one I have the shade 120
I'm gonna add a swatch on my hands so I
can wait a few minutes and then swatch
it again so we can see how much oxidize
and how the color compare once they are
oxidized so I can show you that how the
colors compare and i will be swatching
this one to you but this one doesn't
oxidize so not a problem here so I'm
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to
show you but basically I like that the
coverage of this one is more natural
they fit me actually I should hold them
to the foundation as I'm talking about
it so this side has a little less
coverage but it also looks very very
natural I don't feel like it emphasizes
my pores as much but I do have two eye
patches around my nose it's the winter
so my skin will tend to have dry patches
around my nose and I do think that this
is emphasizing it which is why I
personally recommend to always mix it
with the other version I feel like it
makes the like perfect foundation
because this one doesn't emphasize three
patches whatsoever so if you have dry
skin definitely recommend it but this
one I do like it except around my nose
the super stay at full coverage
foundation definitely has more coverage
and I don't feel like this emphasizes
the dry patches around my nose as much
however I do think it emphasizes the
pores a little bit more right here where
they tend to beep I mean most humans
tend to have them right however I do youf you wanted Emily today's video is
gonna be to review all in Milan I'm
gonna be wearing half of my face to
Mabley foundations so on the website I'm
gonna be wearing the cool favorite at
fit me matte and poreless foundation I
love this foundation because it's light
medium coverage it looks like skin on
your skin it's great if you have oily
skin if you have dry skin I would mix it
with the other ones they have deep do me
one definitely recommend mixing these
together with your great is the combo
even if you have oily skin which I do
have so love this one highly recommended
it's like very very popular for a good
reason but you just came out with this
foundation this is the super state full
coverage foundation and this one has
more coverage and it's a little bit
different and I wanted to wear both of
these on half off my face all day long
so you can see them in action because
it's always great to hear a review but
it's even better if you can see it in
person so I'm gonna be applying both of
these with Beauty blenders basically I
just personally like using sponges
because it gives you the most natural
finish if you want more coverage you can
always lose a brush so on my right to
your left I'm going to be applying the
fit me foundation the colors I have like
my summer shades so they will be a bit
dark for me but we're just gonna blend
that until my neck and pretend
everything is okay
should have zoomed you in but you'll see
the final result
can Nestle seed align the middle of my
face but you can see I did have a couple
of like redness and it covered
everything pretty well you can still see
beauty marks so it's not like full full
coverage but it covered everything that
I really wanted to cover but if I had
like a breakout or something I could
just use concealer wherever I need it
but everything else still looks like
skin that's why I absolutely love it
probably why everyone seems to love it
and it's great it kind of has eight like
Demi matte finish I will be setting it
with powder just because it's what I
usually do it and want to make sure that
my own skin
doesn't make the test result just effect
immediately so on my other face but half
of my face I've been buying this one I
try to go and get to color that was the
closest to it but spoiler alert it does
oxidize so this one will be at first
lighter and hopefully it will be so my
close to it once it oxidized I just
wanted to mention by the way the
packaging they're very similar but are
we so so happy that they came out with a
pump like this should have had a pub
like I wish hopefully they will add a
pump to this foundation because it's so
great but it's such a to just try
and pour it on your head and then put it
on my face so I really appreciate that
they finally added a pump I will be

it's like very very popular for a good
reason but you just came out with this
foundation this is the super state full
coverage foundation and this one has
more coverage and it's a little bit
different and I wanted to wear both of
these on half off my face all day long
so you can see them in action because
it's always great to hear a review but
it's even better if you can see it in
person so I'm gonna be applying both of
these with Beauty blenders basically I
just personally like using sponges
because it gives you the most natural
finish if you want more coverage you can
always lose a brush so on my right to
your left I'm going to be applying the
fit me foundation the colors I have like
my summer shades so they will be a bit
dark for me but we're just gonna blend
that until my neck and pretend
everything is okay
should have zoomed you in but you'll see
the final result
can Nestle seed align the middle of my
face but you can see I did have a couple
of like redness and it covered
everything pretty well you can still see
beauty marks so it's not like full full
coverage but it covered everything that
I really wanted to cover but if I had
like a breakout or something I could
just use concealer wherever I need it
but everything else still looks like
skin that's why I absolutely love it
probably why everyone seems to love it
and it's great it kind of has eight like
Demi matte finish I will be setting it
with powder just because it's what I
usually do it and want to make sure that
my own skin
doesn't make the test result just effect
immediately so on my other face but half
of my face I've been buying this one I
try to go and get to color that was the
closest to it but spoiler alert it does
oxidize so this one will be at first
lighter and hopefully it will be so my
close to it once it oxidized I just
wanted to mention by the way the
packaging they're very similar but are
we so so happy that they came out with a
pump like this should have had a pub
like I wish hopefully they will add a
pump to this foundation because it's so
great but it's such a to just try
and pour it on your head and then put it
on my face so I really appreciate that
they finally added a pump I will be
doing it close-up so you can see
difference in texture of foundations so
the newest full-coverage one is thicker
almost like a a little bit moosie
consistency and me fit me is definitely
a lot more liquidy so we're gonna try in
a cover I do have a little bit of
redness and a few breakouts so we'll see
the coverage but yes again warning at
first it's gonna be way lighter I didn't
mention definitely I have this shade at
125 and in this one I have the shade 120
I'm gonna add a swatch on my hands so I
can wait a few minutes and then swatch
it again so we can see how much oxidize
and how the color compare once they are
oxidized so I can show you that how the
colors compare and i will be swatching
this one to you but this one doesn't
oxidize so not a problem here so I'm
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to
show you but basically I like that the
coverage of this one is more natural
they fit me actually I should hold them
to the foundation as I'm talking about
it so this side has a little less
coverage but it also looks very very
natural I don't feel like it emphasizes
my pores as much but I do have two eye
patches around my nose it's the winter
so my skin will tend to have dry patches
around my nose and I do think that this
is emphasizing it which is why I
personally recommend to always mix it
with the other version I feel like it
makes the like perfect foundation
because this one doesn't emphasize three
patches whatsoever so if you have dry
skin definitely recommend it but this
one I do like it except around my nose
the super stay at full coverage
foundation definitely has more coverage
and I don't feel like this emphasizes
the dry patches around my nose as much
however I do think it emphasizes the
pores a little bit more right here where
they tend to beep I mean most humans
tend to have them right however I do youf you wanted Emily today's video is
gonna be to review all in Milan I'm
gonna be wearing half of my face to
Mabley foundations so on the website I'm
gonna be wearing the cool favorite at
fit me matte and poreless foundation I
love this foundation because it's light
medium coverage it looks like skin on
your skin it's great if you have oily
skin if you have dry skin I would mix it
with the other ones they have deep do me
one definitely recommend mixing these
together with your great is the combo
even if you have oily skin which I do
have so love this one highly recommended

a lot more liquidy so we're gonna try in
a cover I do have a little bit of
redness and a few breakouts so we'll see
the coverage but yes again warning at
first it's gonna be way lighter I didn't
mention definitely I have this shade at
125 and in this one I have the shade 120
I'm gonna add a swatch on my hands so I
can wait a few minutes and then swatch
it again so we can see how much oxidize
and how the color compare once they are
oxidized so I can show you that how the
colors compare and i will be swatching
this one to you but this one doesn't
oxidize so not a problem here so I'm
gonna zoom you extra in in a second to
show you but basically I like that the
coverage of this one is more natural
they fit me actually I should hold them
to the foundation as I'm talking about
it so this side has a little less
coverage but it also looks very very
natural I don't feel like it emphasizes
my pores as much but I do have two eye
patches around my nose it's the winter
so my skin will tend to have dry patches
around my nose and I do think that this
is emphasizing it which is why I
personally recommend to always mix it
with the other version I feel like it
makes the like perfect foundation
because this one doesn't emphasize three
patches whatsoever so if you have dry
skin definitely recommend it but this
one I do like it except around my nose
the super stay at full coverage
foundation definitely has more coverage
and I don't feel like this emphasizes
the dry patches around my nose as much
however I do think it emphasizes the
pores a little bit more right here where
they tend to beep I mean most humans
tend to have them right however I do youf you wanted Emily today's video is
gonna be to review all in Milan I'm
gonna be wearing half of my face to
Mabley foundations so on the website I'm
gonna be wearing the cool favorite at
fit me matte and poreless foundation I
love this foundation because it's light
medium coverage it looks like skin on
your skin it's great if you have oily
skin if you have dry skin I would mix it
with the other ones they have deep do me
one definitely recommend mixing these
together with your great is the combo
even if you have oily skin which I do
have so love this one highly recommended
it's like very very popular for a good
reason but you just came out with this
foundation this is the super state full
coverage foundation and this one has
more coverage and it's a little bit
different and I wanted to wear both of
these on half off my face all day long
so you can see them in action because
it's always great to hear a review but
it's even better if you can see it in
person so I'm gonna be applying both of
these with Beauty blenders basically I
just personally like using sponges
because it gives you the most natural
finish if you want more coverage you can
always lose a brush so on my right to
your left I'm going to be applying the
fit me foundation the colors I have like
my summer shades so they will be a bit
dark for me but we're just gonna blend
that until my neck and pretend
everything is okay
should have zoomed you in but you'll see
the final result
can Nestle seed align the middle of my
face but you can see I did have a couple
of like redness and it covered
everything pretty well you can still see
beauty marks so it's not like full full
coverage but it covered everything that
I really wanted to cover but if I had
like a breakout or something I could
just use concealer wherever I need it
but everything else still looks like
skin that's why I absolutely love it
probably why everyone seems to love it
and it's great it kind of has eight like
Demi matte finish I will be setting it
with powder just because it's what I
usually do it and want to make sure that
my own skin
doesn't make the test result just effect
immediately so on my other face but half
of my face I've been buying this one I
try to go and get to color that was the
closest to it but spoiler alert it does
oxidize so this one will be at first
lighter and hopefully it will be so my
close to it once it oxidized I just
wanted to mention by the way the
packaging they're very similar but are
we so so happy that they came out with a
pump like this should have had a pub
like I wish hopefully they will add a
pump to this foundation because it's so
great but it's such a to just try
and pour it on your head and then put it
on my face so I really appreciate that
they finally added a pump I will be
doing it close-up so you can see
difference in texture of foundations so
the newest full-coverage one is thicker
almost like a a little bit moosie

THIS WHOLE BRAND OF FOUNDATION AND THE CONCEALER WRECKED MY SKIN AND IT&#39;S NEVER ACTUALLY HEALED. I HAD LOVELY SKIN BEFORE USING THERE FOUNDATION. I LOOKED AT OTHER VIEWS AND SURE ENOUGH OTHER WOMAN WERE SAYING THE SAME THING. IT STINGS WHEN PUT ON THE FACE BUT LOOKED NICE ON TILL THE DAMAGE WAS DONE 😩😩
Which mascara you have used dear please tell
Hi Sarah! I know this is an old video but hopefully you see this. A few years ago when my son was a baby and I was a SAHM I began watching makeup videos. Your channel was one that I watched alot. For some reason You Tube stopped recommending your videos. TBH, I miss the old time videos. Before everyone became &quot;infuencers&quot; and everything got so fancy. I hope your family is doing well!!!!  I have hereditary dark circles too and I loved your try ons of concealers to see what covers them. So glad that you came up in my feed again!!!!
That concealer brings back memories 😃
It literally gave me an allergic reaction, my whole face is dry as hell and it burns
Yess I felt a sting under my eyes but ones I blended it it went away but it’s good .
Yes! This is the concealer that I use and I personally love it because it it low coverage.Every once in a while it burns me on my eye lids!!Its weird! It only does it sometimes.
Which shade is this ?
What shade is it?
What is the shade of your concealer?
Hey lovely! What shade concealer is that?
Que tono es el corrector fitme?
It did the same thing to me
What shade is that? 25?
شكرًا ع الترجمه استفدت كثير 😔💓💓💓
I let it set for a minute it gets thicker then covers better. It did sting me too but only under 1 eye but it goes away.
Not her saying it wasn’t that full coverage when it covered her dark circles completely
It literally never stings for me? Maybe your allgergic to something in the concealer
It burns me too.
It burned my skin too! Idk why
Which shade you used
I tried this concealer and it irritated my skin. I noticed bumps under my eyes that weren’t there before I applied it and after I washed it off the entire area under my eyes was red and irritated! Definitely not using it again
What shade did she use?
Your teeth are white tell me how?
What lip shade are you wearing?
Number?
It burned me too !!
Which shade are we wearing mam
Which mascara you use plz post a video
What code is that?
Like everyone in the comments, I&#39;ve been using this for an year and I love it❤️. Maybe your skin isn&#39;t really well with the ingredients in the concealear.
i brought the shade medium but i heard about the burning part in the reviews. When i use it it didn’t burn my skin somehow
Has someone also expierienced brakeput on the forehead?
You can use vitamin e oil and almond oil every night to get rid of dark under bags ! I hope this doesn&#39;t sound rude but you need it ! ❤️
Wch shade did u use????
sting? I use this everyday and it never did that to me
I just tried it recently as my first ever concealer and it burned my eyes as well. I removed it soon after and won&#39;t use it anymore
What shade was she using?
this was the first concealer I&#39;ve ever used and I never used anything else I find that it&#39;s starting to look caky on me and I don&#39;t know how to find another concealer shade that actually works for me :/ I want to try pro conceal but I really don&#39;t know the shades I use shade 20 for this concealer


What shade that she use?
What shade did she use?
There’s probably something wrong with your skin, I’ve never heard of anyone else getting burned by this
Omg I have OK makeup that I use for running errands too!!!!
Maybelline Fit Me Liquid Concealer, or Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser Dark Circles Treatment Concealer? Many people like the instant age rewind better but I feel like the fit me concealer would be greater for beginners. Help me decide 💛
what shade is she wearing?
Try to not speak without important thank you 😘
You bloody talk so much
I find it gives you better coverage if you shake the product first
Maybelline Fit Me Liquid Concealer Makeup  <a href="https://amzn.to/36PBpWm">https://amzn.to/36PBpWm</a> very good video
Please review Maybelline fit me foundation
This is my go to concealer... I have eczema AND very sensitive skin and it’s fine on me. Maybe it’s because I’m in the UK, or maybe they’ve changed the formula?
I really dont like this concealer..it fuckinh burns  and creases my under eye  n make it dry....Will be switching to loreal
This concealer does not work ar all
Oh my your eyelashes are goals
what shade are u in the concesler
I recently tried this concealer and it does burn my under eye skin too. And I don’t have sensitive skin. 😤
maybe you had a slight windburn in that area.
Which shade is this ?
Yes!! The new formula burns me so much I have dry/sensitive skin and it never used to burn me personally until late last year and after I’ve moisturized continuously and constantly it somehow appears very caky as well at times
It burned me every single time 😭
i used this concealer for years now. it only stings my skin when my skin had a reaction to a new skincare products i used and not because of the concealer. whole of the time using the concealer, it&#39;s fine
Shade wich u hv used?
I am very fair (neutral) with noticeable dark circles, as well as a combination sensitive skin type. Their lightest shade is too dark but I use it for colour correcting. When I apply it it burns really badly for a bit but then stops really suddenly. Thought maybe my skin was just being sensitive so I kept using it. After a couple of days I developed these hot pink spots almost like burst capillaries everywhere I use the concealer (eyelids and undereyes). Took a couple of days of not using it to go away. Never had this reaction to makeup before, and the very sheer coverage makes it very un-worth it. It is very light and somewhat buildable though- if your circles are minimal and it doesn’t burn I could see why you’d like it. However I do find that it separates over a couples hours? So either the formula sucks or I’ve been sold an expired concealer.
what shade is it
What number?
So what&#39;s the shade she Used?
You look like the teen from instant family
Sis mee toooo it hurt my eyes soooo bad
It starts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx5F_p5qggE&amp;t=3m19s">3:19</a> and 1.25 x speed<br>Thank me later






all maybelline products burn if you leave it on and don’t blend it in
IT BURNED MY EYES SO BAD! I thought I was crazy. It would hurt to the point I had to ruin my whole look.
Is anyone else&#39;s SUPER sparkly/ glittery? I hate sparkles so I dont like it
is this shade same as shade numer 30
Did anyone have any other reactions? After 2-3 days of using I got really bad rash under my eyes it looked like sever dry eyes but it burned it&#39;s been like 2-3 weeks now &amp; it&#39;s barely going away
it stinged me too for the first time only 😐
it never burned me. maybe theres an ingredient that your skin is sensitive to







It burned me too smhhh
I hate I brought this conceralor since its doesn&#39;t work very well and it burns under the eyes

Nah I have it and it never burns me, it just your skin

That burning sensation, I had the same sensation and I used the same stuff??...it was so weird?!! Like or comment on this if you had the same burning/ stinging sensation?!!

I hate this concealer
It burned my under eye too XD
Maybelline is a Not a good subsidiary company . <br>Lakmé is a Trusted brand. <br>You should use Lakmé .
I have that concealer and it didnt burn
No entiendo ni mierda pero como tus ojeras son casi tan obscuras como las mías me quedo
I bought that concealer yesterday and I didn&#39;t burn me but it burnt my friend
What shade she use ??
Hey, which shade suits you in maybelline fit me matte+poreless foundation?<br>I have the same skintone as you.

This review made me to subscribe your channel. Thank god! I watched this before buying. 😐
Maybe I missed it but do y’all know what color she used?



It stings wen that area of ur skin is kinda dry but u can’t see the dryness
Love this concealer. It&#39;s literally the only one I have ever used lol as a guy it does a great job at giving me a natural fresh look.
What is your shade?
Use this everyday doesnt hurt me
omg!! i thought that I was the only one feeling stinging under the eyes lol.
What shade are you using?

i’m annoyed i spent $15 on this :((
I don’t have dark circles so i think its going to be good
Mam please tell me which shade is this

I love this concealer, I use it almost every day and works great for me. I love the natural finish it gives me.


Which lipstick are u wearing..really suits u a lot sarah
Did she say what color she use? I couldn’t catch🤔

Omg thats the same spot it burns for me too! Im gonna get a new concealer bc it burns so bad :/
Everything burns me there but not that... Like sunscreen somereason hurts so bad on my cheecks but that where i mainly get burnt soo ye like my wipes in wiping it off stung baaaad
it burned me too!!
your mascara ????
what shade did you use?

Thank you! I was at the store and almost purchased this. I also appreciate you zooming in for us. Most YouTubers don&#39;t do that for their audience, so thank you again &amp; God Bless!!
Allelú! a you tuber who actuall has dark circles testing concealers! I have the wost dark circles, my eyelids are dry, blue, purple and black, the skyn feels burn and no cream is absorb. 😢
Burned me too. Cant even use it. Left patchy red skin.

It might just burn u bc it didn’t burn me and I actually liked this concealer and it gave me a good coverage
Very similar to Loreal pro glow concealer.  Both burn a little at first.  Please try new Flower Beauty light illusion concealer.
Would like to know makeup you wear dear
What’s your shade ?
Omg my colourpop concealer sting my under eyes too! I thought it was because my skin was too sensitive under there but now you experienced it too with different concealer... i’m wondering why 😁
The NYX HD concealer burns my undereyes. I wonder what ingredient these concealers have that Shape Tape doesn&#39;t (Shape Tape doesn&#39;t burn).

Hi, can you please review the Elf Charcoal Undereye Masks please? I hope they work for you, I&#39;m curious to see if they work. I heard they were good, but from people with minimum dark circles, so I can&#39;t completely believe them.<br><br>Love your channel btw!!
Great! Which color did you choose?
I&#39;m so glad I wasn&#39;t imaging things.. It burned under my eyes as well. I was done with this concealer after that. I will Never buy this again. I will stick with my favorite drug store concealer Wet and Wild.
Love your concealer reviews, they are very informative.  Would you review the NYX HD concealer?
Hi! I was wondering what lipstick you were wearing in this video? It looks beautiful on you!
what mascara are you using?
can you review the Nars Soft Matte concealer? I love you videos!
I used to have one and it also burned under my eye. I ended up throwing it away and the coverage was not that good either.
Great review!  Your makeup looks absolutely beautiful in this video even though you feel like its a bad makeup day!
I had the same problem with the concealer burning my skin :/ just threw it away...couldn&#39;t deal with a okay concealer.
What lippie is that ?? Sooo pretty
Yeah, why does it sting so much like that? OMG!
the age rewind does that to my undereyes too!

Which lip color are you using?
This concealer burns and stings! It&#39;s so weird! Some days it happens and others it doesn&#39;t! You should try the bare minerals bare serum concealer, hydrating and medium glowing coverage! Sooooo pretty! My fave xx
I usually think of myself as having fairly sensitive skin as well as dark circles and this is the only concealer I&#39;ve found that works for me.
Its one of my favorite concealers
Lol.. I thought i was the only one that experienced the burning sensation under my eyes. Since none of the beauty gurus video mentioned any of this. I don’t really reach for the maybelline fit me concealer because of the burning sensation it gives if I don’t blend it fast. I find myself reaching for the LA Girl pro concealer more and it doesn’t burn my under eye area. I only use tarte shape tape concealer for more fuller coverage on occasions because it can be too thick for everyday look. LA Girl pro concealer works best than this maybelline fit me (although I repurchased multiple times before trying the LA Girl) i ran out of the LA Girl pro concealer and I just had to repurchase because it’s better than the maybelline one. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I have semi-sensitive skin and have never had that stinging problem and this is my holygrail. The way it works best on my oily skin is to let it sit and set slightly then use a brush or finger.
I started using that concealer two years ago, and it stung under my eyes too. It also doesn’t blend that well into my skin. I switched to the cover girl ready set gorgeous concealer and I actually prefer that one over this one. It blends into my skin better, brightens my under eye. However there isn’t that much coverage but I prefer that because I like natural makeup since I don’t wear foundation.
When I first started using it it stung under my eyes too. Since I’ve started using the Banana Bright eye cream there’s no more stinging. So maybe the skin is dry and that’s why it stings, similar to some lotions on dry hands?

sarah are u going to review the it cosmetics tinted moisturizer( i think thats what its called)???
What mascara are you wearing? Your lashes look amazing
What color do you wear in Estée Lauder, if you’ve tried it that is
i watched this even though i&#39;ve already tried that concealer out and it&#39;s  definitely not good
I get the same stinging/ burning feeling when I use my instant age rewind concealer and it goes away when I blend it out too 😬 might be a maybelline thing
Same burning under the eye. Though it was just me. Plus I really do not like how it looks when applied. I’ll stick to Wet &amp; Wild.
Hi! Thanks for the video. Which one is your favorite concealer?
I never understood why they call it a dupe for the NARS concealer. The container may be a dupe but not the actual product...
Same happened to me!! I bought two differents shades, couldn&#39;t use either of them
Love your concealer reviews! What lip color are you wearing?😍😍😍
Hey beautiful! I had the same feeling on my eye when i first tried it and i thought maybe my skin was a lil bit irritated,seems weird. So i was wondering now that you have mastered my concealing methods ( seriously you have saved me) what are your thoughts fighting the dark circles skincare wise? have you thought of  laser or fillers for example?
I have had the same experience with this concealer &quot;stinging&quot;.
I wish I would have seen your video before I bought this! Agree completely, I does not work well at all!
what is the name of the black makeup sponge you are using?
I can’t wear this concealer because it stings under my eyes too
Noooo, I&#39;ve used this concealer for years and it&#39;s always looked great on me. I really hope they didn&#39;t change the formula when they added colors 😫




Have you tried the sisley concealer?
Do you prefer the medium tone from becca under eye brightening corrector? Does it work?


Have you reviewed catrice liquid camouflage? If not, would you mind reviewing it? It has really good coverage, which is why I reach for it when i can’t find my shape tape.




The same thing happened with me as well. It burned my under eye area as soon as I put it on. Plus it didn&#39;t give any coverage at all. So over hyped!




Love your Concealer vids!
👍👍Thanks!! i really like that u r always using RCMA no color loose powder, its less confusing for viewers💐
Hi Sarah :) have you tried the Ulta beauty concealer ? If not, I’d definitely love to know your opinion !!

Flower Beauty concealer please
Good review! I&#39;ve heard similar complaints about how the concealer stings under the eye, ouch! Just a suggestion.. I recommend in your future videos that you put in the info box a list of products that you are using/wearing in your videos even if they&#39;re not the ones being highlighted or reviewed in the video.




Burned me too!! Wonder what ingredient is doing that!
How odd. I have been using this concealer for months now and I have never experienced stinging under the eye. Maybe they changed the formula in the new shades? I also found that I got pretty good coverage when I use this concealer. The only thing I do different is I use a liquid corrector and lightly set it before putting the concealer on top.




Try next..dermablend concealer
Burns soooo bad!!!
I NEED your opinion on the new makeup revolution conceal and define concealer! Love you and your videos, gorgeous! 💕

Aww didn&#39;t like that concealer... love the new colors of the age rewind concealer better

It stings me too! I wonder why?

I love your concealer videos they help me so much, I have an illness called vasculatas were my vains swell and burst and it is in my eyes so I have a lot of swelling and bruising from were the vains burst and it gets so hard to find concealers that cover it. your channel is the best you have helped me so much, so thankyou for all the hard work that you do and I can&#39;t wait for your next upload. all my love Alison xxx
Makeup Revolution Conceal &amp; Define, next please.. :)


❤️❤️❤️
Thanks so much for the description you included too! Knowing it lasted and didn’t get cakey with powder is exactly what I was looking for! Subscribed

That would be fantastic for a lipstick or gloss to have an applicator like this product!  Great idea!
I bought this product for a while and couldn&#39;t use it. Now when I saw this video I tried to apply but the liquid doesn&#39;t come out even if I tried many times. It&#39;s not even one year longer donhoi think it has dried out. Does anyone know any tips to reuse this. 😢😰
Soooo I bought it and I’ve been twisting for seven minutes straight and nothing has come out what do I do
just received my Instant Age rewind Eraser concealer in Carmel shade 144, it’s by far the best I’ve ever purchased. This Shade is perfect for my African American skin tone.
I just bought One and have been twisting it according to the package and still cannot get any make up to go up to the cushion.<br>I’ve tried turning it both ways anyone else have this issue?
Hi Kristi, I love your videos! I would love to see your review of the Reema color correcting palette or a tutorial on how to use color correctors.
Hi Kristi!  Been using this concealer for years and years.  Sometimes I stray away just to try something new but I always find my way back to the Maybelline age rewind.  Other than ELF moisturizing Camo concealer there is none better for me.  Plus both are so affordable. Thanks for another great product review and try on!  ❤!
Can u please tell the shade name
You’re so lucky you don’t have eye  dark circles
I bought this same Maybelline Concealer and it works wonders and it&#39;s so light on my face 💖
Thank youuu, the first time use is not so evident. Took me 20 mins to decide to I should Google how to open it 😅
I friccin hate this product. It&#39;s overall really terrible and doesn&#39;t give any coverage or a nice texture. It feels like microplastic, which I&#39;m sure it is. I paid $2 for it at a thrift store and I got ripped off. It creases under my eyes and looks like a thin film of cornstarch on my forehead. When I touch it it feels soft like an oil, but it&#39;s really just tiny plastic beads so I&#39;ve done nothing but wipe the product away instead of oil. Sucks I have to use it up but I made my own bed with this one. Also they really wasted packaging making it only 6MLs so another environmental cringe.
What color did you get ?
Whybisnit calles treatment concealer... Does the ingredients works to naturally lighten up skin shade
I bought one and done what you said and nothing comes out.

I really like the neutralizer you should get that also you can take off the sponge and it’s really sanitary
what the use applying concealer on top of the foundation??? like seriously? you can’t even see if it works or not. Nah
I hate when spend too much time talking, lol makes me boring . Just to point
Girl your face is flawless
Im 19 years old can i use this concealer

The fact her skin is smoother than foundation 😫
i recently bought this concealer,and let me tell u...i love itttt!!!very creamy,full coverage,etcetcetc...tnks for reviewing it ;)

What about the very black kind of dark circles...? Does it covers them or does it makes them look gray?

Tip: You already have a very defined nose bridge you should put only highlights on nose tip like the size of a pea and put ombre under your nose tip
I need that was thinking of getting it. Ty
mine wont work i have been cranking it for three minutes now :(
Talking toooooo long
Is ivory lighter than “light” shade?😅 it seems so but I’m not sure. Please help


I’m new to makeup.  Do you usually use foundation first before a concealer?

I&#39;ve recently spent more money on make-up that doesn&#39;t work for me in the last month then I&#39;ve spent in my entire life. I&#39;m 51 and starting to look my age. The more make-up I try as far as concealers foundation ect the more my wrinkles get amplified. I gave this product a go yesterday. I applied it until my dark spots were covered and blended perfectly. I ran into the same problem I always have. Great looking even skin with every wrinkle more pronounced then they were without any makeup at all !! It&#39;s depressing me to the point that I&#39;m looking into surgeries that I can&#39;t afford.
Just got myself one too because of all the hope haha. I learned how to use it correctly with this video so thank you! :)

The shade is ivory or cool ivory
What foundation do you use?

what about above the eyes
You dont have any dark circles so dont see reaosn why you need it at the first place sorry but that is the truth
I’m searching of a good concealer, and I’m thankful I ended up here in your video. And now I know how to apply it beautifully lol thanks!


Could I use a brush to blend it out?

Omg you totally sound like Pam!!! 😍😍😍

What is the number of this concealer

OK- you have NO dark circles even before you applied the concealer.

Oh...you look so much like my son&#39;s girlfriend.  Even your voice . I love her, btw. 😀

I definitely can&#39;t blend it with the sponge. Too much comes out. But I just used it for the first time.  So far I really like it. A little goes a long way!

Talked for too long👎
What drugstore concealer won&#39;t give flashback ?








I love this concealer and use it ALL the time. I am 60 years old and it keeps my under eye skin very smooth, crease free and it doesn&#39;t cake up --- at all!


Just bought this today. So excited to try it out

You seem like such a nice person. You have a very friendly/soothing voice, you should make ASMR videos lol.



I baught this today and I barely put product and LOVED IT covered all my dark tiny spots and uneven skin looks so natural and gorgeous also feels extrelight looks like I have nothing on.. very cheap compared to other products def going back to gran a bunch
Numéro de anti serne s&#39;il vous plait

What does it cover?
Does  it work for guys, too?

Yeah ..sure don&#39;t know what your buying as mine will not even come out to get the sponge color...so
I haven&#39;t tried this concealer before, but you have me interested in it now.  I think it looks great on you.


I actually bought this concealer today at target!! I’m just starting to wear real, good makeup and went on a makeup spree, so I’m definitely going to try this out! Thank you for the review :))



Heh heh you&#39;re all:<br>&quot;It&#39;s like a sponge applicator is what it feels like.... I&#39;m just applying it to the places where I want the concealer&quot;&quot;<br>And I&#39;m all:<br>&quot;☺ teehee....well tyvm Her Royal Highness Lady Obvious (cousin of Cpt. Obvious, of obvious fame)&quot;<br>😉😉<br>But really though I love how you don&#39;t sensationalize everything but are still positive and informative. Love your channel!
Am so excited to try this out !🥰


I find this better than anything l have ever tried before. Better than shape tape, creaseless concealer, and aquacealer. I have VERY textured bad skin and this is the only concealer I can use that doesn’t get drank up by my pores. Or make me look oily or ghostly.

Dab it. Don’t brush it on.
How much money is it?
Do u have to wear foundation before you and ply concealer or can u just put concealer on ur face straight away?? Pls lemme know


I love this concealer!!!

I tried it and first of all it’s not full coverage and second, it runs out very fast. Waste of money for that price
How to unopened itandget it to work
Too much chit chat. Would have been more helpful to have left one eye untouched so we can see the difference.


Whats color  this  eraser???

Good lord that’s a lot.  Dots honey dots...
You&#39;re so genuine with your video, so I subbed☺ I just bought this concealer and thanks to you for your review!

It has great coverage but you’re not supposed to wet the sponge..



I am sorry but in what shade is the concealer



Great video! I like that you do the wear test! I love this concealer. I use it every time I apply my makeup. For a drugstore concealer, it works pretty well. I like the doe applicator as well.

can it cover not-so-dark spots from past pimples?



This is my go to concealer !!!!!  I set it right away so it doesn&#39;t crease. Even with eye cream, my under eyes can still be very dry some days. On those days I tap in the powder with a slightly damp sponge. <br>After using it awhile, if the sponge becomes yucky looking, I just pull it off &amp; throw it away. The concealer will still come up thru the top with the sponge off. I apply it with my fingers, then sponge, set as usual. <br>I hope you&#39;re enjoying using it. The only other one I use, but it&#39;s pricey, is the Clinique Airbrush Concealer. This Maybelline one is a pretty good dupe for it. I think the Age Rewind costs less at Walmart than at Ulta. <br>I hope you&#39;re doing well today Kristi and have a wonderful rest of the week ❤




Thank you Kristi for this tutorial <br>It is the best and affordable concealer ever 😊👍


I actually just repurchased this after a long while without using it. I love how nice and light it is....perfect for everyday use! Such a fabulous review :)


Great sharing ... 👍👍👍👍 what is in your background ? Paper Wall ?

Wonderful concealer for women of all ages! I&#39;m happy you got a chance to try it. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one who keeps a list on my phone of products I want to try 😉



My absolute favorite concealer... great video as always


What is your shade
Age rewind is good but turns grey on me...fit me goes well compared🙂
Wow nail paint
Please review Maybelline fit me  foundation and wet n wild photo focus foundation
Age rewind is far superior from fitme... It prevents creasing and blurs the lines and brightens
She looks really aged
Age rewind wins
Any face cleaning product??
Much needed video.  Ty popxo and shraddha. Next pit it against la girl and make up revolution.
Where do you live
Oh I have both of them!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I dont know but i really think popxo is lacking of good content.
Maybelline tests on animals!!
Age rewind definitely
This should become a makeup guide channel😤....
Much needed review
Your content is decreasing day by day
Maybelline makeup tutorial kariye naaa plzzz
Amazing
I have the Fit Me Concealer in two different shades and I purchased The Age Rewind Concealer so many times already as well! I used to be obsessed with it but I think the performance changes after a while from opening it. Because as you said I noticed that it started look more dry and showing my fine lines more. I also really like the L&#39;Oreal True Match Concealer and I think it&#39;s actually my favourite from the drugstore at the moment. Great video lovely! 💕




my English wasn&#39;t good🌼I think you liked maybelline fit me more and what is r number
hi!!!i got both concealers right now(the Age Rewind is finished and the Fit Me!is my new one)and i like it 😺btw,pretty Minnie Mouse ears!!!🐭!!!
I know this video is really old but I have to say your eye colour is so gorgeous!
Maybelline🥰<br>Fite me 🤮<br>By me


You are so beautiful😍...
🌷🍷😎👍🏿
I like the way you said : My most loved drugstore concealer
I have the Sand shade concealer and now I can&#39;t live without it. I don&#39;t even need foundation with it. The colour match to my skin is 10/10 and wears BEAUTIFULLY through the day. I&#39;m inlove 😍🙌🤸‍♀️👌💘
Is it just me who thinks she sounds like DRACULORA (sorry if I spelt it wrong)
Shades???


Great review. I just got the age rewind! Love your Minnie Ears ❤️🙌
Which shade are you wearing in maybelline age rewind?????????

Just for girl. Men keep back!!!!!‬ Definitely i recommend ••&gt; ‪<a href="https://amzn.to/3iZXA2d%E2%80%AC">https://amzn.to/3iZXA2d‬</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMgGoX2xp-c&amp;t=3m24s">3:24</a> omg u read my mind <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMgGoX2xp-c&amp;t=6m00s">6:00</a> wtf u read my mind again
My personal experience with Fit Me concealer is it&#39;s cover my dark circle decently, depends on the lighting and angle though, but it by time it creases settles on my wrinkles, no matter whatever techniques I used to apply it. My undereyes instantly looks 20 years older.

You&#39;re so pretty.
You are too cute!
Fit me the wand is inside the tube however the rewind age concealer the sponge only got a lid so if it falls or sits there attracting bacteria the results of bacteria isn&#39;t shown straight away it takes time with age to see the results.<br>It&#39;s not about putting sponge on the face it&#39;s how make up is handled.<br><br>Some people get the bacteria results fast some people don&#39;t that&#39;s the fuss.<br>Bacteria creates alot of problems such as acne, e.coli, acanthaeomba which can actually blind you.....<br>If you didn&#39;t get any reaction chances of it you might getting it later.<br>To eliminate the chance is best to avoid it, the fuss is not to get sick.




Изключително чаровна,прекрасно   произношение и изобщо👍Fit me мисля е по-добър!
You sound like JANICEEEE...OH MY GOD!!!!

Affordable nga Madam at mgnda n performance nia pra sa price nia,  sulit. D q p xa nasusubukan pero blak ko mgkaroon ng concealer sa future cguro pg pede n mgwork to conceal blemishes. Thank you for this affordable concealer review Madam

What shade are u


you just put on the second layer of concealer. lol.
That tone totally doesn&#39;t match your skin tone. Your skin tone is way more pink.
Another great and detailed review that a lot of people who love makeup will surely appreciate. Nice, Tara! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ytcreators">#YTCreators</a>
Super affordable! ♥️♥️♥️
I just bought one and so far, I’m loving it too 😍😍

Cguro if naa powder mas nakaya pa niya mg stay Tar..

Ever since mao ni ako gamit Tar ..

Amazing ang 199 ra nya ok kaayo ang performance!
