I love the 360 touch screen the loud speakers and the feel of the keyboard  However the picture on Amazon was incorrect Item pic shows a keyboard which includes a10key pad  Instead of notifying me that the computer is no longer available the third party vender sent me with no explanatory paperwork a later model upgraded computer than the one I ordered wo the10key  Great computer but the extra work time  energy  involved in figuring everything out was enormous,0.134,0.039,0.827,0.7783,Positive
I was in desperate need of a new laptop Right off the top my previous laptop was slow and it wasnt powerful enough to support an active lifestyle I researched a few laptops but with all the recent life changesall of which I hope end soon I had to set a budget Setting a budget meant that I wanted a serious laptop but wasnt going to go out of the 1100 price range Well I picked this beauty Right off the top this laptop looks nice both appearance and screen view This model comes with an Intel Core i7 a full HD touchscreen and a SSD for a very good start up I like the overall look and feel of this laptop It is a 2 In 1 but I will keep it in laptop mode as opposed to the other configurations Its too early to do a full blown review but I am satisfied with my purchase and I do feel it will be good in being future ready,0.233,0.027,0.741,0.9897,Positive
Edit 11102020 after 500 worth of computer repairs part of the problem is HP decided to put 2 different size RAM cards in it 2gig and 4gig When I put MS suite Acrobat DC and Trend Micro Security it overloaded it No heavy use simple Word docs PDF surfing and email Tech at the shop said that is a bad setup it puts an uneven load on the smaller card Bad setup But with an extra 500 cash it can function like a normal computer if there is such a thing anymore See below original issue In short these computers sit in storage and you get them update them and with Windows massive updates and crashes this year be prepared for a month of chaos to clean up Death to OneDrive as wellUnless youre a computer nerd  dumpthebloatGreat computer but the bloatware and invasion of privacy by MS is horrible Entry level computer plan on taking straight to tech to have it cleaned Drivers way outdated and had to spend 200 to get it working smooth If youre good with computers and can clean and update its a good buy But unless you order direct with it preloaded with what you bought its a work in progress One HUGE thing Turn off OneDrive ImmediatelyItll steal your whole computer all the files and suck it up Into MS cloud Destroyed my system when I tried to disable,0.132,0.138,0.73,-0.579,Negative
Good laptop gets the job done wouldnt highly recommend for any heavily cpugpu taxing fast paced games but runs other casual less taxing games just fine  Runs a bit hot make sure you keep the airflow good around your laptop  Overall great for work and school  Switches tabs and windows and opens apps smooth as butter i havent experienced any slowdown thus far even after upgrading to windows 11 Would recommend hp makes some darn good laptops,0.243,0.05,0.707,0.9584,Positive

Ive had this laptop going on 2 weeks now  I love it so far I seen it in person at Best Buy and I researched to find best laptops for college students and this one came up multiple times Since Best Buy was sold out for weeks I was glad to find it on Amazon for 100 cheaper and it also came in 2 days faster than expected So far its been great for speed  not too heavy  my favorite part is switching it to tablet mode and being able to touch the screen in either mode Very easy set up and beautiful design The only drawbacks I have is the battery life is kind of short its about 4 hours  may very based on use since I watch a lot of streaming services on it and the internal fan could be a little quieter but doesnt last very long Other than those things this was well worth the money,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.9735,Positive
Great laptop with a lot of memory Ive been having problems with the bitlocker function camera and audio Additionally the backlight against the silver keyboard is incredibly challenging for me to use during the daytime as I have a hard time seeing light against lightI tried to request a refund andor exchange and seller said noMaking the best use of it and still is a great functional laptoptablet on the go solution,0.206,0.051,0.744,0.9259,Positive
Just had it for a couple of days Everythings flying  fast fingerprint signin is a huge plus Touchscreen is responsive to both finger snd styluses sensitivity is just right on Bought HP pen separately  works flawlessly Optane memory seems to speed up tremendously the process of handling image and video files Fan is very quiet doesnt seem to overheat Graphics are good for a full HD but nothing like on your latest smartphone The build is solid aluminum chassis so no cheap plastic feeling but weighs just a bit more which I dont mindHavent tried to play any games yet but Adobe PS and PPro work with heavy files without problem,0.151,0.054,0.795,0.7631,Positive

The functionality of this laptop has been good Unfortunately the battery life is TERRIBLE With light use Microsoft Office some internet use I get about three hours before I have to plug the machine into the charger If the power is less than 50 when I put the machine to sleep of an evening it is fully drained by morning,0.045,0.139,0.816,-0.7291,Negative
I love this new laptop Its lightweight easy to fold to view as a small tv and the touchscreen feature is great for scrolling and moving around the screen Its nice that it has enough ports for my external devices I can plug in an external hard drive my new iPhone 11 Pro mouse and thumb drive With ease Touchscreen Just needs to not recognize my palm when I want to draw but I decided to just draw with my mouse as the Surface Pen I bought gave me jagged pixelated lines,0.129,0.013,0.858,0.8271,Positive
Aesthetically the computer is very pretty For the most part it works well The touchscreen feature is very responsive and it works relatively fastHowever often the internet disconnects What I mean by this is that although my internet itself works fine and everything else has an internet connection the computer will claim that my internet has no connection It works if I disconnect and reconnect but having to do that multiple times a day defeats the fact that I wanted to use this for online classesAlso the computer has really loud fans It seems like it has the tendency to heat from basic functions and will turn on the fans which are just loudIf you care for camera quality this one does not have great quality So those zoom meetings are gonna look kinda fuzzy Additionally the speakers arent super loud especially if you turn it to the tablet form because then the speakers are behind you I dont use my computer camera a lot or the speakers out loud but I thought I should shareThe computer itself is fine outside of the internet issue If that wasnt an issue then I would probably like this computer more,0.096,0.063,0.842,0.5971,Positive
I looked at MANY many options  for days  I called friends  I called tech support I called relatives  I even signed up for Consumer Reports so I could get the laptop reviews  I spent hours on websites including HP Apple Microsoft and others  I finally landed on the HP Envy x360 and Amazon offered the best deal The laptop has everything I needed and some great surprises  I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this laptop,0.274,0.025,0.702,0.9652,Positive

Purchased this laptop in 102020 and today 12072020 I contacted HP support and they ran testing and discovered my battery needs to be replaced I keep hearing this high pitched static noise coming out from under the keyboard My laptop is aware of when the ac adapter is plugged in but will not add any charge HP support was very helpful in assisting me send it in to be repaired but to have this issue just after 2 months idk I will update once I get the laptop back I am a little concerned of the longevity of this product Had a Mac I got back in 2013 that still works like a charm but I switched to Microsoft for school On a better note the touchscreen works very well and this computer has very fast download times Love the look and feel of this computer Who knows maybe just got a rotten egg,0.175,0.036,0.789,0.9751,Positive

I bought this laptop HP  Envy x360 2in1 156 TouchScreen Laptop  Intel Core i7  12GB Memory  512GB SSD  32GB Op in July 2020 It immediately had a problem as it was hot with a very loud squeally fan I called HP and called HP and called HP finally when I actually got a human and not their idiotic virtual assistant his only solution was to have me send the laptop back to their service dept They quoted about 3 weeks turn around with repair shipping etc I told them this was unacceptable as I use this as my work computer and could not be with out this essential tool for my business as a self employed real estate broker My old computer died and this is all had Again after many calls I finally got to what they called an escalation manager He claimed he called me in an email to me but I had no call record of a missed call or a voice message I emailed him back to call me but he never called me Time is moving on as this is almost the end of august and I got many hours of phone calls I finally get a hold of him and told him I need another laptop immediately He said their policy is I have to send in the old one first I offer to pay for a new one and they can reimburse once they get my broken one but they will not do that I  ask for a loaner and they will not do that Finally he offers to order a new fan and heat sink as he thinks that is the problem and he schedules a technician to install the parts at my house I agree to that  But tell him that seems like a very expensive solution they may not solve the problem but that is all he will do A box from HP comes in mid October almost 2 months after ordering and a technician comes out to install it a few days after I receive it he opens the box and discovers that only the fan was received he installs that but the problem is still there He calls in and orders the heat sink which I should have received before he arrived He leaves computer not fixed Two weeks later I get and email that the part is delayed and will not get to me until 12112020 I actually get the part on 12192020 HP is supposed to call me to set up a time to install that I never get a call and email the escalation manager He does not get back to me Yesterday 01142021 I call HP get another support agent and have to go through the whole case history Mind you I now have 4 separate case numbers and two case service numbers This agent can not help me and he gets another escalation manager on the line The manager says the same exact thing that i have to send in my computer for repair again I explain I can not do that as stated above I also told him that I am now having another problem battery life is horrible I told him I need another computer asap he also can not do that and says he will pass this up the line to anther dept He schedules a call today at 01152021 11AM with the new dept No call is received I call the customer service number again wait 45  minutes for some one to actually answered and hear their message repeated every few minutes When he does answer and we go through the whole story again he  tells me another escalation manager has been assigned and he will email me in 48 hoursSo it has been about 7 months since I bought this piece of garbage and still no customer service no resolution I am so frustrated and upset with HP as I had a lot of HP products in the past and they were great and there customer service was also well know for excellence Not anymore Now all their calls go to India and they can not even resolve a very easy problem to fix and put me in this situation Based on  customer service alone I will not buy another HP product I guess the only thing I can say is that I do like the tough screen and the speed of the Corei7 processor but I could have got that with another brand My previous laptop was a Lenovo Yoga and that was a great reliable laptop never made a noise worked great until windows 10 killed it with all their crazy updates and other issues that basically made it inoperableIf you do buy one of their products I do hope your experience is much better then mine,0.079,0.098,0.823,-0.9056,Negative
I bought the HP Envy and after the warranty period ended the hinge failed  They have designed a flawed product  The glass screen is too much for the plastic hinge they have installed to handle and all sorts of folks found their hinges breaking everywhere from months to years down the road depending on how much they opened and closed the lidI used my laptop almost exclusively at my desk  I wasnt opening and closing it much which is probably why mine failed about 2 years in  The warranty is only for one yearUpon researching the problem I discovered the flaw was HPs faulty design putting too much weight onto a flimsy plastic hinge  It is all over the HP discussion boards  What is also all over the boards are people like me who began the long and unfruitful process of trying to get HP to stand behind their product  I was given the run around for many weeks and finally gave up when it became evident they had been instructed to not help people with this problem  They knew what they had done but with money in mind decided quite purposefully to not stand behind their product and fix it  I was accused of dropping my laptop and having other issues wrong which I was trying to get fixed under the guise of complaining about a faulty hinge  2 years later I sit at the very same laptop still using it because I couldnt afford to fix or replace it 2 years ago trying to warn people about HP and HP envy in particular  Nothing was wrong with my computer except the hinge broke because of their design having too heavy a screen for the hinge to support  For two years I have rarely closed my lid  I close it with great care the 3 or so times I have needed to do so  Other than this I just use it at my desk  I never dropped or otherwise abused the laptop  I really like it except for the fact I cant take it anywhere or close the lid to protect it from dustI have just bought a new laptop  I havent booted it up yet but will in a few days  I bought an ASUS one of Samsungs new latopsI will never purchase HP againBEWARE  HP WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DESIGN FLAW WHICH CAUSED THE FAILURE OF MANY MANY MANY HINGES ON THESE AND OTHER HP LAPTOPSNot good  There are too many great competitors to treat your customers like this,0.083,0.102,0.816,-0.4269,Negative

And here comes the issue with the CPU power we mentioned earlier While the firmware allows the device to be pushed to 28W of sustained TDP the cooling solution just cant cope Well unless you add a cooling pad to the mix where the larger breathing space for the fan pays dividends Unfortunately this seems to be a common issue for the Envy series as we had exactly the same problem with the 13inch Envy x360 we tested a few days ago This can be addressed by introducing thicker rubber feet for next year and we really hope HP does that Because the Envy x360 15 15es1000 and its users deserve it	And

Do not buy this laptop I have had one for 5 months and yes you get a pen but you can39t use the pen if nothing on the laptop works First a speaker went then when I was plugging in a Headset I cracked the screen because my thumb which was holding the laptop steady applied a bit too much pressure When the screen cracked the touch screen no longer worked But I could still use it as a regular laptop Then the right hinge went I never dropped or misused the laptop in any way  A few days after the hinge went I turned off the laptop and it never turned on again  Will they repair it  well not the screen that was my fault and not the hinge that is physical damage and probably not that it won39t turn on but maybe they will Send it to us and we will decide if it is covered or not But do not forget if you send it to us and your data is erased or someone steals your PWs that39s just too bad I have had a couple of ipads with cracked screen even holes in the bevel and they kept working Do not buy this laptop it is a waste of money and time,0.029,0.118,0.853,-0.9714,Negative

I got this laptop months back would be 10 months and I want to say it is absolutely AMAZING I love the keyboard and the built in lights are amazing in the dark I love the sleek look of the laptop especially the touchpad The key spacing in my opinion is amazing while doing work as it lets me type extremely fast with minimized errors There are also MANY cases you can find online and each of them are amazing I have one for myself and it fits perfectly onto the laptop The only problem I have is with on of the USB ports where you kind of have to push this little wall down but it is not too bad and wouldn39t affect my rating at all Overall I give this 55 and I have NO problems with it whatsoever even nearly a year later of it falling off my table or sometimes splashes of water on it,0.134,0.075,0.791,0.8488,Positive

It39s a good laptop  There are a few flaws  Audio card doesn39t seem to work all the time since the music or audio skips at times  Another thing that is fumbling is the vexing start time when you close the device and the open it hours later  In the sense that that the Power button does not know what to do  I39ve held it down amd I39ve double clicked and held  Somewhat finicky  I don39t do heavy work besides school work so my machine isn39t under stress  So far I like it  I could39ve gone with a cheaper option but at the time I wanted a computer that was going to last me some time   I do see it in my future life since I39ll be able to do a few upgrades,0.031,0.031,0.938,-0.0157,Neutral

I suppose you can review this laptop and be critical about it but you have to also consider this model is very midrange in spec anyway The series does include models with better displays better processors and more ram Some how in this model you spent way to much getting 1TB of storage which I have noted on HPs site being a ton of money compared to the actual cost of a 1TB nvme drive,0.1,0.021,0.879,0.7935,Positive

Great review I truly don39t understand why so many of these supposedly quotpremiumquot laptops in this price range have a 250 nit 45 NTSC display I39ve looked through Best Buy Costco and Microcenter and the vast majority of nongaming laptops in the 1000 range have the same garbage display It39s incredibly irritating honestly,0.227,0.052,0.721,0.9039,Positive
Great review I unfortunately got this laptop and have been extremely disappointed by it and am looking to return it People really shouldn39t disregard what you say about the display it39s complete garbage and in my opinion ruins the entire laptop Basically if you have any display that39s better than it the display39s poor quality becomes extremely obvious Everything looks so washed out on it that even watching YouTube isn39t a great experience The 200 Chromebook I got 6 years ago is brighter and has less glare than this 1000 HP Envy x360 They do sell a 400nit 100 sRGB model on HP39s website but the issue is that it costs extra to get it especially if you pay the extra 200 for HP39s extended warranty which I39d recommend since HP39s laptops aren39t noted for their durabilitybrbrIt39s basically what you said a display like this has no business being on a quotpremiumquot laptop The only way a display this bad would be acceptable is if it was on some cheap lt400 laptop,0.097,0.115,0.788,-0.3223,Negative

I have the x360 2019 and in the refurbished market I got mine for a cool 600 with warranty It is basically the same apart from no drop down usb a it is only slightly thicker so it has the same io as the 2020 and has a top firing speaker at the top of the keyboard and a larger bottom bezzle to accomidate that the Ryzen 5 3500U is quad core at 37 boost same as the spectre 2020  wow so the performance is in the same ball park The 2020 brings smaller bottom bezzle and the 4000 series processors I cannot reccomend the 2019 version enough as it has all the features of a much pricer laptop at half the pricebrbrthe keys are firm and the complaints about the keyboard palm rest are nit valid for me and I have medium sized hands for the UK male the touchscreen is really useful but I never seem to use it in tablet mode  but that is a personal preference I have noticed that you have to put it in battery optimisation mode in windows on battery power for the battery life to be good but then I run it on max brightness and when I put it down to 75 brightness the battery life is awesome brbrI am a student so my budget was modest and to have a premium laptop is awesome  and the only other feasable laptop for this price would be a pavilion 14 or a dell latitude  and those are all plastic as a student I have no regrets at all with this laptop and it is snappy for my word processing workflow the speakers are very good but I found that you need to go into the bang and olufsen sound settings and give it a bit more bass  and then it is good It is worth noting that it actually has 6gb of useable RAM as the APU uses 2gb for graphics memory this isn39t a problem for mobile workloads as I would have 10 chrome tabs open with video conferencing for the online schooling and it is fine  I don39t think that it is a problem brbrFor gaming I manage around 30 fps in esports World of Warships games on low  medium but I believe that the 2020 model has a more powerful gpu but 30fps is console framerates anywho so I don39t mind I don39t really game on this too much as I mostly use my iPad for that brbrI HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENVY X360 SERIESbrbrHey Linus I know that you read through around half of the comments so there is a good chance that you will see this I would just like to say that you are one of the most hardworking people on this platform and you should be really proud of the company you have made,0.142,0.058,0.8,0.9929,Positive

Well i got a HP ENVY x360 cp0005ng and i must say it39s total crap And I can39t really think that any Convertible from HP is better because they kinda messed up every aspect a Convertible should have Lets start with battery life 4 hours max Then we have the heat problems The Ryzen 7 regulary hits 80C when using office and just one office program Therefore a silent usage is something you can totally forget The fans are always on and are quite noisy And as soon as you hit those 80C the Laptop start to lag pretty hard As well in gaming like LoL with a low resolution as in the normal use of just the OS Nothing works fluent anymore Cool thing is not that if you turn the Convertible in Tablet mode It just heats itself up way faster so you can39t use it anymore way earlier And in general writing the Stylus is not a great experience and for other things when it doesn39t lie on your desk it is just too heavy Did I forget something Probably a lot of other bad things So my recommendation dont buy any Convertibles from Hp They are crap,0.082,0.146,0.772,-0.9003,Negative

AMD is killin39 it lately  What39s a shame is that they39re keeping the x86 architecture alive in doing so  I was ready to suffer an underpowered ARM for a desktop  A beefy ARM would be cool if it existed but there are 2 problems with that  1 ARM still owns their architecture so no proper competitors can arise and any published binaries tie the public to an owned architecture 2 The architecture isn39t built to scale  Outoforder is awkward and instruction extensions not only violate their terms but need to be hacked into their instruction set  For this reason RISCV is my ideal  I want a laptop WITH THAT,0.124,0.143,0.734,-0.5054,Negative

The next few years might be huge for AMD Earlier adoption of PCIe 40 and probably earlier adoption of 50 too once that rolls around USB 4 is coming and hopefully we39ll start seeing better adoption rates of eGPUs Assuming the next generation of GPUs are still on PCIe 30 a USB 4 port piggybacking PCIe 40 will give us the equivalent performance of 30 x8 on the 40 x4 port and with better eGPU adoption that39s huge assuming AMD also supplies us with enough physical lanes to actually do this as laptops are historically starving for lanes especially now that storage is tied to PCIe We might actually see a thin and light give us actual gaming performance brbrNow I know this is a pipe dream but imagine what would happen if AMD gave us the amount of physical lanes needed and two discrete USB 4 ports 2 times the lanes if the ports piggyback the PCIe 40 spec that gives us the equivalent of a full 30 x16 port Considering that Intel seems to stick to their 16 lanes on mobile if AMD could oneup them especially with storage being tied to PCIe AMD could easily outpace Intel at expandability and performance brbrIf AMD takes the right steps and given what they39ve done with Zen and early adoption of PCIe 40 I think they will take the right steps they could easily assert dominance over the mobile market within a few generations At this point all they have to do is outpace Intel and so far they are the rest of it depends on industry adoption of AMD mobile which is starting to ramp up,0.068,0.007,0.925,0.9194,Positive

out of the 10 laptops I have purchased over the years only 2 of them were Intel based My very first laptop many many years ago cause it was a screaming deal and the last one I bought my wife I hated her laptop with a vengeance mostly due to the fact there was no way to effectively disable the  hd graphics even though it had a Nvidia discrete system It never would default to the discrete system even when told to thus forcing you to tell windows to use the Nvidia chip every single time you wanted to play a game Never had that issue with AMD laptops Now that you showed off this bad boy I may consider snagging a couple around the holidays  Intel better wake up,0.079,0.097,0.824,-0.5147,Negative

Why do you recommend bad posture when typing on the keyboard Even if it feels less comfortable for you your hands should hover above the keyboard while typing This is the ergonomic way to type and avoid ailments like RSI Laptops are already bad enough with flat keyboards or keyboards that tilt upward from the user This is similar to ergonomic chairs where less expensive quotpremiumquot or quotgamingquot chair might feel more comfy but ergonomic ones don39t leave you sore after 8 hours of work and prevent back problems and other ailments down the line,0.063,0.135,0.801,-0.8199,Negative

This version is a great spec update too bad that with each generation the ENVY x360 haves something missing from the previous iteration that makes no sense unless they want to make the Specter line look betterbrSomethings 2020 ENVY x360 lost from the 2019 versionbr They moved the power button from one of the sides to the keyboard this makes it unreachable on presentation position and uncomfortable in tent or tablet positionsbr Even worse now the power button is a key on the keyboard in a awkward place left of delete buttonbr Lost the right CTRL key to place the fingerprint reader in a awful placebr The camera privacy switch is replaced with a FN key combobr As pointed in the video they reduced the bottom bezel Most likely to make the laptop shorter but I think they should have made the laptop even taller doing so they could have enlarged the palm rest give a bigger track pad and probably a a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4V3uB12mRrUampt16m10s1610a aspect ratio screenbr That quotbigquot bottom bezel was useful to hold the PC in tablet mode and have a place to restgrab with your thumbbr This reduction in height also also meant that they had to remove the top firing speakers previous models had 4 speakers  2 of them above the keyboardbr Now USBA ports have this hingetrapdoorflap while previous versions had standard regular full size USBA ports while the 2018 and 2019 computers even a few millimeters thinnerbrbrThe 2019 version also had a couple of drawbacks vs the 2018 modelbr Lost the side volume rockerbr Lost the Windows Hello facial recognition function but at least it gained the fingerprint reader without losing any keybr The Damascus steel pattern that was laser etched to the back is gone too it was of no usefulness but it gave the laptop a even more premium feelbrDon39t get me wrong this computer seems great I have the 2018 version as my daily driver and it still is a formidable machine in every aspect My experience till now is so good that I didn39t hesitated to recommend it to my sister when she needed to replace her computer she got the 2019 version,0.084,0.099,0.817,0.2743,Positive

Im hoping that seeing more AMD laptops from large manufacturers means that by the time Zen 3 mobile chips release we will see a good offering of flagship offerings with AMD chipsets instead of mostly only Intel I mean just the fact that MSI even has an AMD option shows how Intels hold is slipping considering that MSI likely was threatened with losing some under the table payments to prevent AMD competition means that MSI felt they would make more by offering AMD than taking the money from Intel,0.087,0.06,0.853,0.1531,Positive

Great video thank you  It is great to see AMD making some headway in the laptop market I do wish we could see some true gaming laptops built and using AMD39s highest performing mobile chips and maybe the best mobile dGPU just to see the best case performance from these Zen 2 mobile chips So basically would be nice if companies like ASUSMSIGigabyte and any others like Clevo if they still are in business take AMD39s highest mobile CPU SKU and maybe use something like a RTX 2080 mobile if that is the highest on offer now and let it rip through gamesbrbrEditedbrI had to laugh at the 16x9 aspect ratio part and how a lot of companies are switching to 16x10 I remember when 16x9 was all of the rage for monitors and 16x10 was marketed as bad and 16x9 was much better It is good to see most are switching back to 16x10 aspect ratio since it gives you a bit taller screen which is far more useful than 16x9 aspect ratio Now all we need is for them to get rid of 16x9 on the desktop as well but of coarse that will never happen with everyone in the craze of ultra wide monitors right now I guess it would be great to see mobile phones take a step back and go from these extremely long screened devices and be made with wider screens as well but again that won39t happen until the long thin screen craze dies out,0.151,0.031,0.818,0.9793,Positive

As someone who just bought this exact laptop except with a larger SSD slightly over a month ago I can whole heartedly agree with basically everything in this review It is easily the most highend laptop I have ever owned and it shows in build quality and just overall niceness of the machine I have a few slight issues though one of them is the lack of ethernet even with the USBC hub HP sells you as an optional extra which has hdmi 2x USBA and USBC also switching between laptop and tablet modes closes the application I am using for some reason usually youtube or netflix through a browser although that is more likely to be a windows thing than an hp thing and I have since gotten used to tablet mode enough to get my videos back on the screen within 2 secondsbrAnother slight issue I have is that it doesn39t recognise my handwriting very well although my handwriting is also terrible so that might not be relevant for anyone elsebrOne thing that puzzles me about this review though is why you decided to compare the CPU to that in the Spectre and then made the quot200 more expensive machinequot argument if that same CPU is also an option in the envy for the same price as this ryzen model in fact for 50 more I am using the Dutch website to compare prices you have an I7 Still it is hard to argue for intel even at the same price it39s just weird that you added that 200 difference as a mark in favour of the AMD laptopbrAlso you CAN charge it through type C it just gives you a message that it recommends you use the original charger that came in the box every time you do so,0.056,0.052,0.893,0.3025,Positive

I have the x360 2019 and in the refurbished market I got mine for a cool 600 with warranty It is basically the same apart from no drop down usb a it is only slightly thicker so it has the same io as the 2020 and has a top firing speaker at the top of the keyboard and a larger bottom bezzle to accomidate that the Ryzen 5 3500U is quad core at 37 boost same as the spectre 2020  wow so the performance is in the same ball park The 2020 brings smaller bottom bezzle and the 4000 series processors I cannot reccomend the 2019 version enough as it has all the features of a much pricer laptop at half the pricebrbrthe keys are firm and the complaints about the keyboard palm rest are nit valid for me and I have medium sized hands for the UK male the touchscreen is really useful but I never seem to use it in tablet mode  but that is a personal preference I have noticed that you have to put it in battery optimisation mode in windows on battery power for the battery life to be good but then I run it on max brightness and when I put it down to 75 brightness the battery life is awesome brbrI am a student so my budget was modest and to have a premium laptop is awesome  and the only other feasable laptop for this price would be a pavilion 14 or a dell latitude  and those are all plastic as a student I have no regrets at all with this laptop and it is snappy for my word processing workflow the speakers are very good but I found that you need to go into the bang and olufsen sound settings and give it a bit more bass  and then it is good It is worth noting that it actually has 6gb of useable RAM as the APU uses 2gb for graphics memory this isn39t a problem for mobile workloads as I would have 10 chrome tabs open with video conferencing for the online schooling and it is fine  I don39t think that it is a problem brbrFor gaming I manage around 30 fps in esports World of Warships games on low  medium but I believe that the 2020 model has a more powerful gpu but 30fps is console framerates anywho so I don39t mind I don39t really game on this too much as I mostly use my iPad for that brbrI HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENVY X360 SERIESbrbrHey Linus I know that you read through around half of the comments so there is a good chance that you will see this I would just like to say that you are one of the most hardworking people on this platform and you should be really proud of the company you have made,0.142,0.058,0.8,0.9929,Positive

TLDR NobrbrWell for the same other spec39s you shouldn39t consider Intel but considering AMD still doesn39t have laptops with GPUs above a 2060 if need something beyond a 2060 you are stuck unfortunately There are really decent AMD laptops so I don39t think you will be lacking for build quality etc to any significant degree with the right choice but them lacking highend GPUs is a big hit,0.032,0.081,0.887,-0.5267,Negative

Hello There I shortlisted 2 laptops for me HP Pavilion Plus I7 12700HOLED amp HP Envy 133 I7 1250UOLED Which is better buy overall My requirements are For normal daily use Running various softwares Research Playing games sometimes Must have great display Good touchpad amp keyboard Durability amp Reliability I know Pavilion Plus has better CPU but I don39t think there will be much difference in real life performance amp It doesn39t have Thunderbolt ports After the discount price difference is very less amp both are comfortably under my budget So should I buy Envy over Pavilion PlusAnother short question is Should I slightly increase my budget amp buy Spectre 135 I7 1255UOLED Value for money is most important for me So is it really worth to spend almost 400 extrain my country this is the price differencefor Spectre over Envy amp Pavilion Plus  I am fine with just little inferior quality amp few less features,0.157,0.058,0.785,0.9297,Positive

Anyone able to help with tablet mode and rotation New machine the Ryzen 7 model got 2 days ago Worked for a couple of times going into tablet mode by folding the screen back but then it stopped working properly Depending on its mood it either a doesn39t turn on tablet mode when flipping the screen back but the keyboard does get disabled so that works b refuses to autorotate in tablet mode c leaves the keyboard disabled when returning to laptop mode Have tried everything I could find online Did all windows updates and HP updates it updated the BIOS too Spent a couple of hours with Microsoft support who were unable to fix it Occasionally just after booting the rotation works but then it randomly stops working So does anyone have experience of this and managed to find a solution Thanks It should basically allow me to fold the screen back and become a tablet that auto rotates then flip the screen back over and it automatically becomes a laptop Mine doesn39t To rub things in it even says quotautorotatequot on the screen when you put it into tablet mode by flipping the screen back sometimes Thanks in advance,0.09,0.021,0.889,0.9343,Positive

I have the 15quot model with Ryzen 7 And it39s a beast of a laptop Especially for CPU related tasks But I am a 3D artist And I chose this laptop because I wanted something more portable than a gaming laptop which are powerful and a separate pen display And I really thought this was going to be it Well it is but isn39t It has decent power and performance for basic 3d sculpting work And standard 3D poly modeling it handles easily But the pen support The palm rejection is horrid and the barely 1cm above the screen you have to be for the pen to be activated makes this a pain I went with Wacom39s Bamboo active stylus Best Buy sells people on after looking at some reviews And the problem I have found is that the buttons on this stylus or HPs own cant be remapped to middle mouse click And that is important to me as it39s the button you normally use in Blender to rotate around your scene Which is very handy when sculpting and working naturally I found a work around using HP39s own Pen utility by mapping a button to Alt and turning on 3 button mouse emulation in Blender But over all the device makes me wish I just lugged around my XP Pen Artist 156 Pro instead Because as professionals we want the tools to be out of the way of our creative process And sadly this just hasn39t been it I will probably sell this laptop and use a basic machine to remote desktop into my workstation at home and bring along a simple pen tablet instead So close But yet soo far,0.124,0.072,0.803,0.9305,Positive

I stopped my search at the Samsung Notebook 9 Pro 15quot from 2017 It39s got an AMD gpu and the color accuracy is about as good as a budget pen display  not as accurate as the XpPen I sold it for However the laptop uses the S Pen so I was able to use the Galaxy Tab S4 for it It39s crazy how it39s more accurate than my pen displays pen  which is a dedicated device I got it for 550  and I could have got the HP Zbook x2 for 660 I probably should have for the 4K 100 Adobe display but the processor and gpu are weaker and i kinda want to play games too hahabrbrIt39s also pretty light,0.099,0.058,0.843,0.6079,Positive

dont know 90 degrees,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it feels very loose like if youre,0.268,0.25,0.482,0.0478,Neutral
holding this up like this screen,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
is going to tilt backwards now the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
weight on this thing is about 411,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pounds so its not the lightest 15 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ultrabook by any means but i still think,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its light enough that youd be okay,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
carrying this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on a daily basis theres a lot of i o to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
work with here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like on the lefthand side you have your,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
usb port,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hdmi usb typec if you want thunderbolt,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
youve got to go with the intel model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but because this is using ryzen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its just a regular usb typec port,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
audio jack and then,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the other side you have your barrel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
connector for power,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
another usb port and a fullsize sd card,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now probably not a big deal for a lot of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
people but you cant open up this laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with one hand you have to use one hand,0.478,0.0,0.522,0.7506,Positive
to hold the deck down,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hey nice deck dude thanks dirk its real,0.487,0.0,0.513,0.6908,Positive
cedar,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and because this deck is so big some of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you might say why didnt they put,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a numpad and look you have two options,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you either put a numpad on this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then put the speakers on the bottom,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or you go with upward,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
firing speakers me personally id rather,0.0,0.324,0.676,-0.34,Negative
have the upward firing speakers,0.0,0.375,0.625,-0.34,Negative
now the typing experience is okay i find,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
the keys to be a bit too mushy compared,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to the spectre,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but its fine if youre typing on them,0.239,0.0,0.761,0.296,Positive
for a long period of time theres a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fingerprint scanner,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right beside the alt key if you want to,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
use windows hello to log you in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the touchpad its centered and its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
19 bigger,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
compared to the previous year now the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
touch pad doesnt have the same,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
finesse as a true glass touch pad its,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
fine,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.2023,Positive
but its nothing compared to lets say,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the touchpad on the surface laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now when you open up this display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres a bit of wobble so like if,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.5009,Positive
youre typing on this very aggressively,0.0,0.341,0.659,-0.3804,Negative
the screen will shake,0.0,0.362,0.638,-0.1779,Negative
a little bit and the display is okay,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
like theres two versions of this,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
theres a cheaper one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats only 250 nits but if you spend 80,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dollars more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you get this one here its 16x9 and i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feel like this would have been a good,0.519,0.0,0.481,0.6597,Positive
opportunity for hp to incorporate,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.4215,Positive
a 16 by 10 display instead but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its not a bad panel like it gets close,0.26,0.193,0.547,0.1877,Positive
to 400 nits of brightness the color,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
gamuts good,0.744,0.0,0.256,0.4404,Positive
and i feel a lot of people spending the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
extra money on the more expensive one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
will have a good display for design work,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
now since the speakers are on the top of,0.184,0.0,0.816,0.2023,Positive
the deck if youre curious how it sounds,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
im compared to the surface laptop 4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and you guys let me know which one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sounds better,0.744,0.0,0.256,0.4404,Positive
Music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now the price on this is a thousand and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thirty nine dollars at least the review,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
unit that i have here but i think its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty fair considering its packing the,0.579,0.0,0.421,0.6705,Positive
latest,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ryzen 5000 cpu with 16 gigabytes of ram,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

ssd like if youre doing anything,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
multicore related,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this thing absolutely screams like if,0.3,0.269,0.431,0.0735,Positive
youre some sort of developer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and youre compiling code then this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thing is going to be absolutely awesome,0.423,0.0,0.577,0.659,Positive
to use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the one area that it kind of does suffer,0.0,0.304,0.696,-0.5423,Negative
in is when youre doing anything in the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
adobe suite,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like intel processors paired with their,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
iris xe,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
still give you better results but most,0.245,0.0,0.755,0.2382,Positive
cpu related tasks has an advantage on,0.25,0.0,0.75,0.25,Positive
these amd,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
processors now when it comes to heat,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
management it does pretty good,0.67,0.0,0.33,0.7269,Positive
like i tested this out on balanced and,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
performance mode when youre using,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
balanced mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it keeps the cpu temps under 80 degrees,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
celsius but you get a nerf in clock,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
speeds the advantage to this is you get,0.222,0.0,0.778,0.25,Positive
a very quiet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop under 40 decibels or around 40,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
decibels of noise,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when you kick it onto performance mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it gets a little hot it goes up to 90,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
degrees but it doesnt do this for a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very long period of time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the fans will be louder it will slightly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
go over 40 decibels but youre able to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
push this thing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a bit more yes i think hp could have,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4576,Positive
been more aggressive with the tuning,0.0,0.275,0.725,-0.2247,Negative
but most people are just using this for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
every day and i think,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they value fan noise a little bit more,0.485,0.0,0.515,0.5719,Positive
than having the maximum performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now thankfully a lot of the regular,0.359,0.0,0.641,0.4215,Positive
stuff youd expect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is upgradable like theres one slot for,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
an nvme ssd,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and you can swap this out for something,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bigger the other thing is the ram,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is not soldered onto the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
motherboard so if you want to put more,0.183,0.0,0.817,0.144,Positive
ram in here down the road,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you have the option to do so and i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

tend to use only one but even with just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
an integrated gpu like this one,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
two fans do a better job of keeping this,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
thing cool you have your swappable wifi,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
six card,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then you have a 51 watt hour battery,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which gets me about 11 hours and 44,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
minutes of use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

you unfold the laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the trackpad tends to offbalance a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit if you click on one corner or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the other,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

rest of the keyboard i personally like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
having dedicated power buttons,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.4588,Positive

inherently bad its just not good,0.0,0.596,0.404,-0.7101,Negative
considering this is a premium laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so you have a full hd 1080p screen which,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in itself is not bad the resolution is,0.289,0.0,0.711,0.431,Positive

from a gaming perspective,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this laptop is about what youd expect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so the intel iris xc chip can only,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

so much power because its an integrated,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

100,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with a moderate workload that quickly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the battery life can drop to as little,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2732,Negative

is the touchscreen and the hp stylus,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
given the fact this is a convertible,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

laptop well priced at 1050 usd,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
this is a twoinone laptop thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
competing in the premium market,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

you may be entirely driven away from,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that less than ideal color accuracy,0.384,0.0,0.616,0.4804,Positive
again,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also the battery life is not that good,0.0,0.256,0.744,-0.3412,Negative
in itself eight hours of average usage,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

decent on this machine the bottom side,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the laptop has changed a little bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so you still have that high quality,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the old design better and yes of course,0.483,0.0,0.517,0.6808,Positive
this is a stereo speaker setup sound,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
test to follow later on in the video as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
soon as you unfold this laptop you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
appreciate the amount of palm rest space,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive

large 15inch laptop like this what you,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
will appreciate also is the massive,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive

of surf real estate space and its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
appropriately put in a laptop of this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
class unfortunately quality isnt all,0.0,0.375,0.625,-0.34,Negative
that good for example you have a plastic,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
surface finish this is a premium laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it should have a glass surface trackpad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on top of that while the clicks are,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
tactile there is a moderate amount of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
flex on either the right or left bottom,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
corners and the calibration isnt all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that good either generally speaking i,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
was expecting a considerably better,0.516,0.0,0.484,0.4927,Positive
crack pad given this is technically a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
premium laptop on a lighter note the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard is pretty good so youll notice,0.55,0.0,0.45,0.7269,Positive
you have large keycaps with plenty of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
surface area its well labeled its,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
fully backlit and the overall quality of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

you have tactile keystrokes and you also,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have plenty of key travel but you also,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
appreciate the fact that its not a very,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
loud keyboard its great for a,0.506,0.0,0.494,0.6249,Positive
productive or office environment now you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
do have a builtin fingerprint scanner,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right next to the arrow keys one thing i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
absolutely despise about this keyboard,0.0,0.402,0.598,-0.4005,Negative
is the lack of a 10 keypad which could,0.0,0.247,0.753,-0.3182,Negative
have been easily accommodated if hp,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.34,Positive
would finally get rid of these pseudo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
grilles they dont cool the laptop nor,0.0,0.246,0.754,-0.2411,Negative
are these speakers in fact they dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really serve any major purpose and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
getting rid of them would just allow you,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
to fit more practical things like a 10,0.513,0.0,0.487,0.6444,Positive
keypad again so definitely knocking off,0.411,0.0,0.589,0.541,Positive
a full star for that the hinge quality,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on this laptop is in fact top notch,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
which is a requirement for any good,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
convertible laptop it doesnt have a lot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of wobble its sturdy it has the right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
amount of calibration to keep it tight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but not so tight that it might be a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
problem in the long term overall it,0.0,0.31,0.69,-0.4019,Negative
should do great in the years to come now,0.339,0.0,0.661,0.6249,Positive
display fitting you have a screen to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
body ratio of about 88,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which isnt bad and youll notice you do,0.289,0.0,0.711,0.431,Positive
have somewhat of a thick chin at the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bottom but the bezels in contrast are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
relatively narrow you also have a pretty,0.39,0.0,0.61,0.4939,Positive
thin forehead at the top what is quite,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
shameful of course is that miserable,0.0,0.615,0.385,-0.7506,Negative
720p webcam you can toss your dreams of,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive

if you really push the fan to its limit,0.243,0.0,0.757,0.3744,Positive

except that it costs a casual 1800 US dollars,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
which is why we will not be comparing the Envy x360 to it,0.0,0.149,0.851,-0.2732,Negative
Instead well be testing it against the HP Spectre x360,0.189,0.0,0.811,0.2732,Positive

But that maximum boost speed of 37 gigahertz,0.336,0.0,0.664,0.5499,Positive
isnt a good first sign,0.0,0.445,0.555,-0.3412,Negative

the topspec 8core model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Even more surprisingly though the 4500U,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3597,Positive
managed to dominate the singlethreaded test as well,0.219,0.156,0.625,0.1531,Positive
thanks to that higher boost clock,0.583,0.0,0.417,0.6808,Positive

if Intel was the only option in town because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I mean in fairness that is at least faster,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
than the 15gigahertz base clock,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Thing is Intel isnt the only option anymore,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

Its worth noting that youll have to,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
enable performance mode to get these kind of speeds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but theyre truly remarkable,0.814,0.0,0.186,0.8674,Positive
Remember that Dell XPS 13 with a 6core i7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

Yeah,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.296,Positive
In performance mode this Ryzen machine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

The thing is performance matters a lot less,0.155,0.0,0.845,0.0258,Neutral

that youd wanna take home with you anyway,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
One of AMDs big problems for years now,0.0,0.278,0.722,-0.4019,Negative

The Envy line does sit below,0.0,0.296,0.704,-0.2732,Negative
the Spectre line in HPs lineups,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So has HP given their Envy x360 enough love,0.316,0.158,0.526,0.4767,Positive
Or should you just save up a bit longer,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive

Actually I am pleased to report,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
that HP has committed no such crime against AMD here,0.142,0.385,0.473,-0.5574,Negative
The Envy x360 has a premium look about it,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2732,Negative
from the super small bezels,0.494,0.0,0.506,0.5994,Positive

like Lenovo Flex 14,0.455,0.0,0.545,0.3612,Positive
So I think its fair to say that HP,0.268,0.0,0.732,0.3744,Positive
really nailed the balance here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The only thing build qualitywise that annoyed me,0.0,0.271,0.729,-0.3818,Negative
was the screen which wobbles a bit more than Id like,0.235,0.0,0.765,0.4144,Positive

I do wish that instead of the barrel power connector,0.252,0.0,0.748,0.4019,Positive
on the right side we got another USB TypeC port,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with charging but presumably,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that wouldve brought up the price,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and I think they found a great balance here,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.6249,Positive
One place HP fortunately didnt cheap out is the display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

I think anyone short of a professional photo editor,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

My only complaint here is the 16x9 aspect ratio,0.0,0.216,0.784,-0.296,Negative

that Im only using a small portion of a trackpad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats already very undersized by todays standards,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
To be clear the switches are good,0.524,0.0,0.476,0.6705,Positive

now I have it on performance mode and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that gets up to about 43 to 45 decibels,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

stay a bit higher on the 15 inch model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just due to the bigger chassis but the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

since it is a laptop putty the pull,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

could stick the pen to it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the pen just kind of is there another,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thing to be aware of is the fan,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
tended to be on when i was drawing on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this thing and the fan points like right,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.5859,Positive
its at the bottom so it points right at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your wrist while youre drawing on there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so if you dont like hot air blowing on,0.0,0.209,0.791,-0.2755,Negative

it does that on to the drawing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
experience,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so this is the pen that comes with the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hp envy x360 and the main thing to know,0.0,0.208,0.792,-0.2732,Negative
about this pen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is in the back of it there is a battery,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and what you find in many battery,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
powered pens,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is that you get some wave and jitter to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your lines and this pen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is no different so im starting this,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.296,Negative
process this little demo here that im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
about to do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in autodesk sketchbook and and the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
reason why,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is because sketchbook sentence to have,0.206,0.0,0.794,0.0772,Positive
wigglier,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lines wigglier im trying having a hard,0.0,0.219,0.781,-0.1027,Negative
time getting that word out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
than many other applications and thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
totally what im seeing here let me zoom,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in here so you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these arent like super slow like,0.0,0.711,0.289,-0.7481,Negative
sometimes ill go really slow,0.0,0.412,0.588,-0.4215,Negative
to get the wobble in there these are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just kind of normal speed lines,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and and they look nasty they look,0.0,0.375,0.625,-0.5574,Negative
absolutely,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
horrible the other thing that was,0.0,0.412,0.588,-0.5423,Negative
happening in sketchbook,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is i was getting these palm recognition,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dots,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i should point out im wearing a drawing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
glove people ask that in every video,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the main reason i wear that is is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not so much to reduce these,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh palm rejection dots the main reason,0.0,0.368,0.632,-0.5423,Negative
is because its august,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and its hot and my hand sweats and,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
sticks to this smooth glass screen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there is a way to turn on streamlining,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with these lines which is how i drew,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
most of this character,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so your wine will start really jittery,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but when you let go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
itll come in there and itll smooth it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
out for you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so there are some ways around that if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you choose to go this route,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lets jump over to photoshop here and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im going to go ahead and create a new,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
document really quick,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because in photoshop i feel like im,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
getting better performance than,0.492,0.0,0.508,0.4404,Positive
i do in an app like sketchbook now you,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
do see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
some wiggle to the lines but its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know its not as bad as what we were,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.431,Positive
seeing before let me undo that brush,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
stroke,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and let me get some lines in here just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
some normal speeded lines,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im making up words here as i go and you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can see theres some jitter to these,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i can turn on smoothing in photoshop and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
once i get it up to about 20 percent you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
see these lines get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty nice actually those look pretty,0.754,0.0,0.246,0.8481,Positive
good so there are ways to turn on,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
smoothing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and to get this pen looking better than,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
it was before,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this also has smoothing on but im going,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to just kind of go through the pressure,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
and the pressure curve is okay it it,0.188,0.218,0.594,-0.0772,Negative
seems to at times take a little while to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
turn,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on it has i would call it a strong,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.5106,Positive
initial,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
activation which means you have to apply,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more force,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
before it starts happening so if i just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the linear edges and so forth now when,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it comes to the fit and finish of it I,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
would say its pretty good although I,0.604,0.0,0.396,0.7269,Positive
noticed a little Flex in the chassis and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the keyboard deck but not much but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
again at this price point Im not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
surprised but for the most part this old,0.172,0.0,0.828,0.1154,Positive
metal design really holds up and one of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the things Im seeing a big Improvement,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.4588,Positive
is less green wobble than you got last,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
year so when youre typing you dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have a lot of movement on the screen and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that was a big complaint last year and,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.296,Negative
Im glad they remedied that in this,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4588,Positive
version,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay lets check out the port selection,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
on the left side is a USB a port next to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that is a 35 millimeter microphone,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
headphone combo Jack and I love to see,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
this a fullsize SD card reader and the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
card sit flush with the unit they click,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right in there and I love that now on,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.6369,Positive
the right side are two USBC ports that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
are full functions supporting data,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
charge and display out now no longer do,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
you need a barrel pin connection to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
charge this laptop as this does support,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
USBC charging hence they give you a USBC,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
adapter this time around now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
unfortunately these are not USB C4 ports,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.34,Negative
which would give you a lot of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
functionality youd get from a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thunderbolt port and it was not able to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get it to work with my Thunderbolt drive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that I use for SSD storage that didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
work on this so its not usbc4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can put it into the tent mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then of course presentation mode and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then of course tablet mode and again,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its a little heavy for a tablet but you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can do all the things you need to do now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there are four total options when it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
comes to the display and itll depend on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whether or not you got the Intel version,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of this laptop or the AMD if you go with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the AMD there are two options I have the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
IPS version with the 250nit display and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres also a new OLED option thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also full HD 1920x1080 thats the first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
time theyre offering an OLED version on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this panel in terms of an AMD laptop now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if you go with the Intel version of this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop then you can go with the IPS that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can get as bright as 400 nits and then,0.266,0.0,0.734,0.4404,Positive
theres a brand new Quad HD version,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats 2560 by 1440 that also has a high,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
refresh rate 120 hertz and that can get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as bright as 300 nits again intel only,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
now HP sends over the IPS version that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can get as bright as 215 nits now thats,0.266,0.0,0.734,0.4404,Positive
not what I I was really hoping for here,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.4754,Positive
I was hoping to go above 400 nits even,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
but of course if you go with the OLED,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
option which I highly encourage you to,0.418,0.0,0.582,0.5563,Positive
do so that will get as bright as 400,0.266,0.0,0.734,0.4404,Positive
nits but this one is rated at 250 nits,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in terms of the brightness I actually,0.342,0.0,0.658,0.3818,Positive
measured 260 again below my 300 nit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
threshold,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now one thing you need to be aware of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is a very glossy display you will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
notice that glare and Reflections,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
depending on your lighting conditions,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but I think the OLED version is going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have less of an issue because that will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get as bright as 400 nits as opposed to,0.266,0.0,0.734,0.4404,Positive
the 216 nits I measured in this IPS,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
model having that higher brightness will,0.342,0.0,0.658,0.3818,Positive
reduce the amount of glare Reflections,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they have to contend with but it wont,0.136,0.0,0.864,0.0258,Neutral
totally eliminate it so just keep that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in mind and in everyday use for the past,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
week or so that Ive had this has been,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually pretty good now this retains a,0.604,0.0,0.396,0.7269,Positive
16 to 9 aspect ratio so what does that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mean you wont get the black bars on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
top and the bottom as you would with a,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
three to two aspect ratio or even a 16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to 10 so retaining that 16 to 9 on a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
156 inch device I dont mind that and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you also get 88 screen to body ratio,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that means youre going to get those,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really small bezels so you dont have to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
contend with the black bars and you get,0.146,0.0,0.854,0.0516,Positive
the small bezels Ill take it now as far,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.4215,Negative
as watching Netflix Amazon YouTube its,0.254,0.0,0.746,0.1779,Positive
been great on this again that is a,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.6249,Positive
glossy display youll have to keep that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in mind and but for the most part its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
worked out pretty well and of course the,0.469,0.0,0.531,0.6486,Positive
OLED will be even more enhanced in terms,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the really deep blacks the vibrant,0.362,0.0,0.638,0.5267,Positive
colors the really high contrast that you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get with an OLED display so for those,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
spend the extra money I think its a 90,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
premium and that to me is well worth it,0.364,0.0,0.636,0.4588,Positive
although it wont do quite as well in,0.254,0.0,0.746,0.3353,Positive
terms of the battery life well get into,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
that in a little bit now if youre a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
content creator I would stay away from,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this IPS panel judging by these numbers,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that I was able to measure on here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
especially the color gamut not being,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very good in terms of coverage thats 61,0.313,0.0,0.687,0.4927,Positive

terms of the ddr5 weve been seeing here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in 2022 a little bit of a negative but,0.0,0.27,0.73,-0.3,Negative
the fact of the matter is you could put,0.121,0.0,0.879,0.0258,Neutral

16 gigabytes which you can configure at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hps website you can actually put it I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
would say two 16 gigabyte sticks in here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for 32 gigabytes of RAM and itll be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
running of course in dual Channel mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

a faster drive now when it comes to the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
WiFi this has the mediatek WiFi 6E,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

its been really good in that regard now,0.313,0.0,0.687,0.4927,Positive
they did away with the numpads so those,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

that last year so thats a carryover to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this year so for those that want it you,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
dont get it now as far as the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
multistage backlight that this has the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keys light up white and its easy to,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
differentiate to see the contrast,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
between the keys and the white backlight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

expect good job on the touchpad and its,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
a nicely sized touchpad at that okay,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.5859,Positive
lets get into the performance and were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seeing a nice yearoveryear performance,0.483,0.0,0.517,0.4215,Positive
increase here not a huge increase but a,0.424,0.19,0.386,0.2069,Positive

the integrated Radeon graphics its not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to blow you away in terms of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
graphics performance but you can do some,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
video editing and some 3D rendering I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wouldnt do 4K video editing on this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youd want to look for something with a,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
discrete GPU and when it comes to gaming,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I think it goes without saying this is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not a dedicated gaming laptop there are,0.0,0.332,0.668,-0.357,Negative
better options out there with discrete,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive

occasional game here and there but as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your main gaming laptop I would look at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
other options,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and one of the reasons were seeing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty good performance on this is,0.604,0.0,0.396,0.7269,Positive
because Im seeing little thermal,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

stress test to see if this will power,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.4215,Negative

it would get a little bit high in terms,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the temperatures but never getting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
overly hot and never reducing the clock,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
speeds to the point where performance is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
compromised its actually had pretty,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.4939,Positive
good clock speeds throughout now when it,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
comes to the fan noise the fans will,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
kick in on their heavy load getting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
about 45 or 46 decibels at the loudest,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when youre under that performance mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but under the regular mode youre pretty,0.417,0.0,0.583,0.6486,Positive
much quiet all the all around thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty good now when it comes to the,0.504,0.0,0.496,0.7269,Positive
surface temperatures relatively cool,0.434,0.0,0.566,0.3182,Positive
throughout in terms of the surface,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
temperatures there is a few hot spots,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the one above the keyboard below the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

underside as you see here but for the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
most part remained relatively cool,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
okay lets talk about the battery life,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
and as I mentioned earlier this is a 51,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

conclusion saying thats too small the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
battery life on this has been excellent,0.381,0.0,0.619,0.5719,Positive

in terms of charging,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

when it comes to the audio there are two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bottom facing speakers as you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
here and I thought the vibe could be a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit louder but I thought it was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
decent and the mids were decent and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there was a hint of bass not the best,0.0,0.325,0.675,-0.5216,Negative
audio Ive heard but again at this price,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

measurements definitely not bright,0.38,0.339,0.281,0.0757,Positive
enough and its a highly glossy display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which compounds the issue so if youre,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gonna get this I would go with the OLED,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but there is a silver lining to this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

so i always like the envy line because,0.281,0.213,0.506,0.1725,Positive
well they sit between the pavilion which,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
is a pretty low end line from hp,0.311,0.204,0.485,0.2732,Positive
and the very pricey spectre line and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youve got things like an aluminum clad,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive

price currently actually 659 on hps,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
website,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and that gets you a rise in five eight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gigs of ram a 256 gig ssd and a full hd,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
touch and pen compatible display not too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bad,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.5423,Negative
really considering this is a pretty,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.4939,Positive
classy chassis a nice design all that,0.588,0.0,0.412,0.6908,Positive
sort of thing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the mod that we have is a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
higher in configuration and list price,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is about 999 youll probably find it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for less again,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and now it has 16 gigs of ram 512 gig,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ssd horizon 7 and a full hd,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

which is like 80,0.455,0.0,0.545,0.3612,Positive
more totally worth the spend i would say,0.292,0.0,0.708,0.3551,Positive
unless you work in really dark places,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all the time especially because hp,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
displays are very reflective,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so inside we have amd ryzen like i said,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
so this is a 5000 series set of cpus,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we have the ryzen 7 5700u,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it gets a little confusing what ryzens,0.0,0.243,0.757,-0.1548,Negative
doing with the useries cpus this year,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

and in terms of thermals and battery,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
life its still,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doing better than intel and so its,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
desirable nonetheless even its not the,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
ultimate fastest and it allows them to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sell it to you for this great price so,0.379,0.0,0.621,0.7073,Positive
yeah i mean were talking about eight,0.306,0.0,0.694,0.296,Positive

with a full HD Plus option thats IPS,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
1920x1200 multitouch display that can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get as bright as 400 nits then the,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
midtier one would be the one with a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
2560 by 1600 resolution that also can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get as bright as 400 nits and then,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive

that HP sent over thats the top of the,0.184,0.0,0.816,0.2023,Positive
line display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and I love the move to a 16 to 10 aspect,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.6369,Positive
ratio youll see a little bit more on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

you got last year now something to keep,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in mind with a 16 to 10 display youre,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to get slight bars on the top and,0.184,0.0,0.816,0.2023,Positive
the bottom when youre consuming media,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that was optimized for a 16 to 9 aspect,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4588,Positive

display theres no 4K plus option this,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.296,Negative
is as high as its going to go the 2880,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

28 KO LED display is simply superb and,0.369,0.0,0.631,0.6249,Positive
if you have the money I would go with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the top here also good press in the,0.439,0.0,0.561,0.5719,Positive

not a big deal this laptop like i said,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
for the allaluminum chassis,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

youll get a hold of a aluminum laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre like man it just,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
it feels so cheap so thin and chintzy,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this laptop does not feel thin and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
chintzy,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in my opinion so one thing i wanted to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
correct about my unboxing is i said that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the top,0.643,0.0,0.357,0.2023,Positive
vents were actually speakers and this is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
incorrect the speakers are right here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

unfortunately when you turn the computer,0.0,0.324,0.676,-0.34,Negative
over and you take it apart,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyre not really venting to anything,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the fans are in the middle,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which makes sense because the main vent,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the bottom cover is in the middle,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but where are these top grilles venting,0.268,0.0,0.732,0.296,Positive
are they pulling air in are they,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pushing air out its it looks to me as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more for show than anything the other,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the vent,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
along the bottom of the screen so the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
top of the keyboard deck which makes,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2023,Positive
sense,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because this right here would be the top,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
of the keyboard deck,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so that vent would actually be useful in,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
pulling air in or pushing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
air out of the chassis the vents along,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the side,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont really make sense so this model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
runs substantially cooler,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
than this model and because of that your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
only main vent is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually right here along the back panel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

has the vent,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
along the top of the keyboard deck,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2023,Positive
because this vent,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually vents your laptop because the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fans are right here in the middle,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay so very important to consider,0.516,0.0,0.484,0.5059,Positive
moving down to the keyboard deck it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

no numpad which is great for creators it,0.333,0.179,0.488,0.4404,Positive
just kind of gets in the way,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but you also have your toggle switches,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and you do have fingerprint sign in so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can sign in with your fingerprint,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now there is a button cutoff switch for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the webcam but there is not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a technically manual switch to cover it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so you just kind of have to trust that,0.292,0.0,0.708,0.5106,Positive
it actually is turned off here is the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

so this laptop continues to be made more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

in mind the screen is also a big upgrade,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for creators this year you can get a 99,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the lack of the dedicated gpu,0.323,0.247,0.43,0.1779,Positive

your playback at half quality or fourth,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

in good hands however the export time is,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
a little long at seven minutes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
versus 1080p at about a minute 34,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
