I got the absolute base model 16 M1 Pro model and even there its been a complete beast By far even to this day if someone asked me what my favourite Apple product was its this I tested the waters on the final Intel 16 MBP to see if the largest specd model could facilitate my workflow of OBS streaming PhotoshopFinal Cut Pro multitab Chrome browsing and other little smallbite apps doing work like FTPchattingetc in the background It absolutely couldnt even do the first step of OBS streaming immediately ramping up the fans when opening the app and by the time the app even started to render a preview window it started to throttle down to a point where its unusablebrbrThe base 16 M1 Pro MBP not only never ever kicks up the fan enough for me to hear them but it now runs my 100 layer Photoshop documents multiple 1015 usual tabs on Chrome every single extra dockfullres preview and actual streaming on OBS and all my other apps like Discord Transmit FTP Music and even a queued up demanding Handbrake video conversion It does all of this at once whisper silent with a maximum of some very slight warmth when you touch the aluminum right next to the fan I couldnt even imagine how much better this works for even more complex workflows with the higher spec options considering mine is the absolute lowestend M1 Pro chip running off of 16GB of RAM Just madness fantastic work Apple,0.086,0.042,0.872,0.9094,Positive

I honestly HATE that they got rid of the Touchbar It seems not many people know about BetterTouchTool which fully unlocks the TB and many other features like remapping the tilde key as the Escape key on my 2017 MBP since they were stupid enough to remove the physical Escape key and put it as a digital key on the Touchbar BetterTouchTool is insanely amazing and I have the Touchbar setup for shortkeys in Photoshop Illustrator Firefox and the general Mac settings I agree that it39s a bit sad they charge so much for the new MBP and yet still use older tech inside when newer tech is available I will sadly very very much miss the Touchbar when I upgrade to a newer MBP Seems I will have to get used to using Touch Portal on my older iPad for hotkeys,0.099,0.104,0.797,-0.397,Negative

As someone who has never owned an apple product I must say this laptop is really nice especially compared to windows laptops Only thing that I don39t like is the smearingghosting when moving anything on the screen at 120hz I bought this laptop for Blender 3d because Apple joined the dev fund to support Metal Blenders viewport performance is extremely good and the trackpad support is perfect I also just found out that Windows 10 Blender releases don39t support trackpad gestures like Mac releases of blender do I tried a trackpad on my windows 10 pc for Blender and it was terrible But there is a patch D7660 Add support for precision touchpad gestures on Windows which I beleive is just now being integrated into blender on windows 10,0.144,0.016,0.84,0.9192,Positive

Even if you don39t need the full potential of a Macbook it is still worth it in my opinion The reason for that is that I have bought a Macbook Pro 3 years ago and it still works as if I bought it yesterday The performance has not changed and it is one of my best longterm tech investments brI had experience with two other laptops for a couple of years with Windows and their performance has decreased significantly after just one year of usage Besides the specs don39t matter because one of my laptops was a highend gaming one and still sucked after one yearbrThe operating system is out of great importancebrbrSo my personal opinion is that Macbooks are way more expensive but you can use them for at least 56 years without any problems or decrease in performance which I believe is the better option,0.097,0.013,0.89,0.8857,Positive

Consumer tech has alienated most people in pursuits of global market domination but offers lower priced lower functionality products to maintain loyalty in the hopes that one day that individual will pour money into arbitrarily and redundantly upgraded tech that is still self stymied as to not lose out on profits because their product is too good for people to never buy another Companies like apple will crumble rapidly as a result of their own competitiveness and pushing of unwarranted services on consumers What will pushback look like when people realize even if theyre content with a device or device they already bought that companies will indirectly find ways to force the redundancy of their own devices to sell more year over year The capabilities only match the capabilities of the individual or system of individuals Ignorance and arrogance reign supreme in this post modern world The optimists are now the idiots and the self proclaimed righteous turned out to be the most heavily corrupt China is going to make fools out of a large chunk of people who have played along with their games the past 30 years pushing for the development of tech through their means of production and cheap Human Resources then stealing and producing for themselves the very technologies we developed to earn ridiculous profits China did it to take over the world Someone or many people originally sold out to China and it would take a literal army to expose that fact and fill in the void that has been circled for decades now proving a clear outline around Ill content Apple the insularly empire,0.138,0.102,0.76,0.9251,Positive

Previous Macs had lot of memory leak issues and I dont think this will be any better as the OS still remains the same Also its not only about having a laptop for video editing It seems that Apple knows this part and is in general focusing mostly in that segment Not focusing on increasing the apps that are compatible with it  the apps that are mostly used in the Engineering industries are not compatible much Also Apple knows that companies dont want to pay a premium on one laptop just to get a MAC So basically thats why Mac is still mostly a household laptop with a premium tag brAbout memory I dont know how its managed much but have seen that a 64GB RAM Mac ends up using almost 90 of it while running servers which a windows 32GB machine handles easily So other than video editing I am not sure what else is so good about it,0.071,0.033,0.896,0.7938,Positive

People need to stop calling everything a dongle A dongle is a little device that provides connectivity to another port like a small HDMI to DVI converter a USBA to USBC adapter a small minihub even a small SD card reader I could accept But an external DAC is certainly not a dongle That39s an external accessory like an audio interface or a webcam Most accessories can be connected without any dongles and many accessories that have legacy ports like HDMI USBB and MicroUSB can be connected without dongles because USBC cables exist for them I have a USBA to USBC dongle and that39s honestly about it for the dongles I39ve ever needed on my USBC only devices In any case I feel like people forget that even old MacBooks needed external devices to give them additional functionality and that adding an SD card reader and HDMI output isn39t going to change that for a lot of people I39m glad to have the ports but also can we acknowledge that very few MacBooks have ever had native HDMI outputs in the first place Outside of 20122015 MacBook Pros people needed dongles on pretty much every MacBook to enable HDMI output,0.138,0.019,0.843,0.977,Positive

The other difference between the maxedout 14quot and 16quot the maximum GPU clock speed is about 200MHz lower for the 14quot If you go with the 24core GPU in the 14quot you get the full 1295 MHz GPU clock speed So the 24core GPU in the 14quot is almost the same performance because of the lower clock speed for the 32core but it costs 200 less and probably burns through the battery a little more slowly There39s a video that talks about this Max Tech I think BTW the 24core version is implemented by disabling two cores in each of the four eightcore clusters bnotb by disabling one of the eightcore clusters This is likely superior to disabling one full eightcore cluster from a performance point of view memory system implementation details too detailed to be explained here,0.032,0.105,0.863,-0.872,Negative

Obviously this thing is a beast on the inside and that39s really exciting To say it39s great on the outside is well only half true Yes the ports are great albeit not toptier but I haven39t been bothered by dongles since my first month with my 2018 MacBook Pro The notch is ugly and ridiculous but I39m sure I39d get over it in two days like I did when I got my first notched iPhone They should still not have made it have a notch though The new keyboard is ugly but that39s a very minor issue The two worst parts of this new design are the overall shape and the removal of the Touch BarbrbrI have an old probably nolongerfunctional 2005 MacBook in storage One of the old white plastic ones Seeing this design immediately made me think of that MacBook and that39s the opposite of a good thing They could have easily kept the great design of the 20162020 MacBook Pros while making it thicker and adding ports but they apparently went for some unfortunate nostalgia This isn39t the end of the world but it is disappointing to see for surebrbrI know the Touch Bar is controversial but it39s one of the best parts of my MacBook Pro The removal of the Touch Bar is going to make me hold on to mine for longer past when the price is finally offset by the benefits and when my current one starts to show the need to be replaced I use my Touch Bar ALL THE TIME and there are so many convenient applications for it If anything it39s held back by the lack of thirdparty support in apps and games that could definitely benefit from leveraging it There are two easy ways to fix the controversy here sell a model with the Touch Bar and one without it or simply add the Touch Bar above a row of function keys Nobody needs fullheight function keys anyway I literally forgot for YEARS that you could put function keys on the Touch Bar with the function key that39s how useless they are to me Their functions work even better on the Touch Bar than with static outdated function keysbrbrI mourn the loss of the Touch Bar and I blame users for pressuring Apple to remove one of the best external innovations they39ve had in years on the MacBook It could have been on external keyboards on the Air and it could have been great But whatever hit your volume key ten times while I slide volume with one gesture that takes less time away from my work Move your cursor all over the screen to find what you need while I toggle it all right above my keyboard You got what you wanted your loss,0.131,0.099,0.77,0.9531,Positive

As an engineer even one who doesn39t use any apple products I have to respect the m1 chips For a while improvements in CPUGPU computing have been very incremental The m1s are a legitimate big step forward They39re not the fastest processors in existence but they keep up with the top tier at least core for core in terms of CPU GPU being a bit harder to determine with Apple39s quotcores39quot being a bit opaque at fractions of the power consumption The power draw in most or at least many scenarios is no more than the equivalent of between 13 leds often 50 or even 25 of what an intel CPU would draw  while still giving top tier performance Which is crazy Huge respect to the engineers responsible for creating these I wish Apple was the type of company to license this kind of stuff so I could run whatever software and OS I want on these chipsbrbr Mostly due software the closed ecosystemlack of customizability and I39m not a fan of iOS or macOS,0.153,0.044,0.803,0.9566,Positive

I think the notch and other design decisions are due to this be a lowvolume product for Apple There is definitely a possibility that they expect demand to be short of the panel amount they expect from their OEMs so they leave room for the largergrater number of sensors they39ll need in the future Otherwise it39s simply they want to say in the next gen  quotWe got rid of the notchquot  which will likely be after Apple weighs all the priceperformancemonetary returns they can before they make a decision The PRO line likely sells in very small number introducing the notch now likely is a move to decrease acceptance in the future and help ensure panel supplies can be maintained,0.12,0.024,0.856,0.8727,Positive

Long Term Review and Update  I have a 2013 MacBook Pro 14 screen that lives in my truck  I own a custom home building company and use this little computer pretty often but not all the time  I live in Texas so the computer in sleep mode lives under the back see in my truck  The battery maintains a charge even if its back there for a couple weeks  This has been the very best computer of all time  I really cant say enough good about it  My work load obviously isnt building apps or making YouTube videos but mainly email pulling up and marking up blueprints texting and so on  This thing has been bulletproof  Put it this way it has outlasted the three trucks its lived in over the last 7 years,0.062,0.023,0.915,0.7262,Positive

I feel Apple made a mistake by changing the tapered edges for sake of change My new 2021 16 MacBook Pro M1 Max Space Gray kind of looks like an older IBM ThinkPad I do not like the boxy sides and flat top Plus without the bottom taper its actually more difficult to pick up since your fingers cannot get under it Otherwise Im happy with all the other upgrades and improvements,0.16,0.065,0.775,0.7655,Positive

My hypothesis newer Mac book pros will have Face ID Face ID will require a notch If Apple made the decision to not have a notch on this model a user would down grade to have less screen realestate when Face ID is implemented in newer models In addition this is a major upgrade Thus regardless of a creator39s stance on the notch they are going to buy Because it is so fing expensive buyers are more likely to rationalize the notch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

The only knock I see is Apple continuing the trend to be behind on wireless connectivity technology  Wifi6E represents the first change in wireless spectrum available in over 20 years more than doubling wireless changes available and Apple missed this boat  This will be the first time 80 and 160Mhz channels are realistically usable in enterprise dense WiFi deployments  I am certainly biased as an enterprise network architect but choosing to handicap wireless users to 50 speeds on upcoming enterprise networks is a big deal  Think of it as doubling the time for your artist to upload completed projects to the enterprise servers    Great all around product but don39t go cheap on the wireless  The time to process work is only half of the equation  We have to get the data off our systems to establish the collaborative environments we seek  This is good but could be great,0.106,0.02,0.874,0.9493,Positive

Totally respect your comment about not gaming on a Mac I will say though for what it39s worth my 2019 MacBook Pro 16quot cranks out Cyberpunk 2077 at max everything and remains very smooth I don39t like playing with everything maxed though so I cut some stuff down to a reasonable level and it39s still amazing looking and runs like butter That39s on Windows via Bootcamp though On the Mac side I do a lot of Steam gaming on it mostly single player games  I don39t keep up with the Fortnites and the Overwatches and all that but the most recent thing I played was Soma and I was able to run that at max graphics and specs 60fps So for those people out there who say you bcan39tb play games on a Mac I urge you to give it a shot you might be surprised That said I do a lot of my Windowsbased steam games on a Linux machine now,0.128,0.012,0.861,0.9358,Positive

I am on a 2012 MacBook Pro with an I 716 gig ram I got a 2 TB SSD Thats relatively new I had a 1 TB SSD before that I am so sick of my computer its been a great computer but now its constantly running slow Ive got the rainbow wheel spinning a lot and I dont know how to fix it I have clean my Mac I constantly wipe the ram I route reboot the computer often but it still just runs slow its specially when Im doing video calls and that sort of thing Im thinking of buying the new M1 14 inch but Id really like some opinions I would like to max out the ram since Ill never be able to add ram again but to do that Ive got to go up one step in a processor and I want a 2 TB SSD because I have run out with a 1 TB in the past All that puts me at around 3800 before the Apple care warranty Its just unbelievable to think of spending four grand on a laptop but I use it as a desktop I fold it up and I have a big wide screen monitor and I use it every day for work 8 to 10 hours a day and when Im not at work Im on the computer watching YouTube videos and whatever else so most of my life is spent on this computer hence Im thinking go all in Finally one last thing and I would love anyones opinion after reading this Im the type of guy that will try and keep a device whether it be at the laptop or phone or whatever as long as possible I am not the guy that upgrades an iPhone every year or two years I currently have an iPhone 12 Pro I got that about six months ago prior to that I had a 6S And it works great but it was finally time to upgrade So I plan on keeping this is absolutely long as possible thats why Im thinking of going to 64 gig of RAM I cant stand that they will allow you to update the ram later or the drive They force you to buy their expensive SSD drives Anyway anyone who would like to give me their thoughts please doThank you,0.117,0.016,0.867,0.9909,Positive

I knew it I knew that the bullcrap slimming trend of laptops wasn39t a sustainable engineering path How are you gonna cool the machine that is consuming more and more power with each generation effectively with using a smaller and smaller heat dissipation system There is no magical innovation aside  that does this thermodynamics is a well established and stable science and there have been no practical physics breakthroughs in that field for many years If you have less and less space something is getting stressed whether its the fan motor running at a much higher speed or the processor having to be capped in it39s clock or be constantly throttled to minimize heat output so the fan and heat sink can sustainably handle the load without the CPU overheating It39s always a tradeoff The problem with apple is that they focused too hard on aesthetics and idiot consumers blindly buy into it paying a premium price Everyone with half a brain cell knew that removing the ports was a stupid decision Why is everyone praising Apple for bringing then back They clearly made an obvious mistake that idiot fans were trying to find a way to justify it Whenever you buy from apple you never get the best in terms of pure  computational capacity per dollar,0.107,0.112,0.781,-0.2887,Negative

I feel like the explanation of the notch is pretty simple They39re waiting to incorporate FaceID in the next generation but don39t want to have to increase the size of the notch to do it Sure they don39t need the 2021 notches to be as big as they are just to fit the camera But I imagine people would be more irked if the 2021 notch was tiny and then grew way bigger to implement FaceID in a year or two They39re planning ahead by getting everyone accustomed to a big notch so that when they add FaceID they39re only giving you an quotimprovementquot rather than a tradeoff,0.155,0.0,0.845,0.9387,Positive

I remember it was 2008 I bought myself Playstation 3 used but hot staff this time Problem was that I had just crt screen and to play first time hd game I had to visit my friend whose parents bought sony bravia 32 hd TV Since PS3 was a HEAVY peace of incredible technology 13 years ago I used my ryanair size suitcase to carry this console from one apartment to another being proud myself that there is someone in Poland not using 55x40x25 case to smuggle cigs to UK but to show magnificent games in crazy 1366x768  Do not laugh about this iMac case since there is a purpouse to share new technology among certain people ,0.195,0.1,0.705,0.9345,Positive
Life choices Buy an apple and be cool and trendy or buy a PC laptop that can do the same for 10001500 less and use that money to improve the world There39s a reason the logo of apple simbolizes the original sin  and i don39t care if you tell me a similar PC can39t do the same They can and they are a lot more upgradable repairable and versatile Although It39s always funny to see apple trolling their fans with amazing features like ports or notches,0.206,0.037,0.756,0.936,Positive
For me the m1 macs are disappointing I work as a 3d artist Apple compared the m1 to 3080 for rendering 3d scenes I mainly use redshift as a renderer The m1 max is pretty much demolished by the 3080 mobile for the redshift bench marks While the GPU is definitely good for being integrated it doesn39t even compare to windows laptops at less than half the price that have 3080s The cpu component of the m1 is great but for 3d work the gpu is pretty much the most important thing now because the faster you can render in real time the betterfaster you can work in 3d If apple had not compared it to the 3080 I probably wouldn39t have had such high expectations Hopefully though we can see a better gpu or a imac with a m1 cpu and a nvidia gpu,0.15,0.014,0.836,0.9622,Positive

Can39t wait for mine to get here Should be next weekbrbrAlso small technicality in the wording you used Saying it quotDropped 2 from 96 to 94quot isn39t correct It is said that it drops two POINTS Not percent 2  96 gets you 9402 which is totally close enough for rock and roll but only because that39s so close to 100 On the other hand if the numbers were from 22 to 20 that is closer to a 9 drop A 2 drop from that would be 2156 So in that instance it is better to say 2 pointsbrbrI39m fun at parties I swear I don39t bring any of this stuff up I just have a  couple drinks and dance,0.131,0.053,0.816,0.9109,Positive

Ive been cutting on Mac laptops for almost 20 years now initially using a cut down version of Avid then eventually on FCP They were always a less efficient workflow but ameliorated because of gear portability I have the 13 MBP with only 16Gb RAM which has been a much more useful way to cut 4k than my old maxed out 51 cheese grater Im as so many of us are waiting for delivery of my M1 Pro with 32Gb RAM and a 2Tb of internal storage but in a 14 version because a lot of my work is done while traveling around Asia and Europe so a kilo or so of weight reduction is awesome This is going to be such a welcome addition to the arsenal of so many traveling content creators journalists video artists VJsetc who will have so much more fun creating work with all the extra horsepower Now if only we can get you guys to stop with the ridiculous 8k rubbish If you cant get it in 4k youre just wasting storage space or if youre doing content for multiplex projection why are you not carrying a 27 4k second screen with you to get your grading done better Oh and 27k proxies are an editors best friend,0.164,0.062,0.774,0.9829,Positive

Btw I think the reason the notch is that specific size is because they plan on integrating Face ID in future models and by that time everyone will already be used to the notch and thirdparty software will already be familiar with it from a development and UI perspective  So for now it39s probably more of a placeholder for future upgrades,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

I love what they did there to the enhancements even though I really hate that they took out the Touch Bar as well as I don39t really like the bulky outward design I got the M1 MBP back in February or so and I39m super satisfied because it39s just enough for my tasks of producing music and editing very simple videos with some color grading I know the example lacks depth but when my old laptop needed realtime to render an audiofile the MBP need 4 seconds 4 SECONDS  WTFbrSo as tempted as I would be to upgrade I just don39t need it at this particular moment and I think the M1 I got will be sufficient for at least the next 23 years even though I know of some people that worked with MB as old as 2012 so much for a lifespan,0.076,0.018,0.906,0.7212,Positive

The ironic thing here is that had Apple not gone on their quest for extreme thinness the last 5 years of portable pro machines wouldnt have been running so hot brbrSure we can blame Intel somewhat for never delivering on promises made but ultimately it was Apple that chose form over function and I assume have paid a heavy price for thatbrbrAnother point of irony that shouldnt be lost on anyone is that the Pro and Max chips would have run perfectly fine in the chassiss from last year Proven with the 13 inch Air and Pro running M1 however I dont think we should have ever lost all ports in favour of USBC nor do I think anyone benefitted from the thinner design over something that could have housed more batterybrbrLets hope Apple have truly learned from this,0.182,0.037,0.781,0.9789,Positive

Great Review Well worth the wait  To get 64GB RAM you will need to get the M1 Max  I am a cloud architectdeveloper  The M1 MaxM1 Pro benchmark results using XCode VMs and other tools crush a 2019 MBP 16quot i9 2464 GB  It destroys it without needing to turn on the fans and while using very little battery  Apple39s crazy SSD pricing is the only thing that I dislike  The limitation of only having a 2 TB SSD in my 2019 MBP 16quot killed my workflow on a project  The crazy price to jump to a 4 TB SSD really stinks  Win11 ARM running in a Parallel VMs seems to handle my Windows needs Certain PowerBIAzure apps only run in Windows    I usually travel with a Windows and MacBook  This could be my one device to cover anything thing that I need to do for my clients  Unfortunately it seems to have really killed the resell value of my 2019 MBP 16quot,0.072,0.159,0.769,-0.9367,Negative

Great review as always These are no doubt revolutionary brHow about the longevity though As everything is 39integrated39 in a chip if there is even a tiny issue with RAM or a single connection on the board you have to replace almost the whole MacBook with almost the same price as new after a year MacBooks famously are not repairable just replaceable So what we are paying is for is essentially just 1 year of assured use brSaying this as my 2017 Mac died for no reason after just a year also my iPhone 7 after a year and half Or factor in Apple care cost while buying a new apple product So basically the cost of new Apple product is more than you think I am still a longtime Apple guy though ,0.072,0.078,0.85,0.0772,Positive

I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux I decided to make that move after Apples introduction of the M1 processor which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform Now of course the M2 has been released but depending on your needs the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air but I feel confident youll find plenty to verify what Im sayingThe Retina display is beautiful The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used The battery holds up all day under typical use and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off The Apple OS Monterey is smooth and fast and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly When you need help a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly or you can avail yourself of Apple supportI will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports lacks a builtin card slot and of course is not equipped with a touchscreen However I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readerseven a portable DVDburner As far as a touchscreen goes I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on but I never use itguess Im a mouse or touchpad guyThe aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished the keyboard has a very nice touch the battery seems to charge quickly and the Air is light at under 3 lbsOne last thing I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment I run Googles Backup and Sync and Microsofts OneDrive with no problems My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machinesI have no regrets for this purchase Actually the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini They all work together very well,0.147,0.029,0.824,0.9952,Positive
This is my first macbook and thank you for changing the shipping restrictions I was able to buy one I am still adjusting with the keyboard and the OS coming from a long time windows user The battery life is amazing Better than my windows laptop Hopefully I can buy the higher specs next time I dont mind paying the tax I originally wanted to get the 16gb ram and 1tb storage but it doesnt ship to my location And thanks for the fast shipping,0.138,0.0,0.862,0.8689,Positive
I have two MacBook Airs MBA a 13 and a 11 both with the previous form factor the wide body colored bezel around the screen 1280x800 resolution and this new 13 MBA improves upon it in every way almost and makes it nearly perfectGood SCREEN looks great  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel  I usually dont go above 50 brightness KEYBOARD is good  Some have mentioned that it still sucks but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say the Magic Keyboard  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes BATTERY LIFE is fantastic  Havent done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors wifi usage video streaming HD vs 4k video viewingprocessingetc screen brightness type of app being used etc but for my usage mostly web browsing video viewing on YouTube accessing VPN for work Citrix EPIC etc it has been great  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far LOOKS GREAT  Love the newer I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now design looks and feels great  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight NO FAN  Thats awesome as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans PERFORMANCE  It works great so far on what I have used it for which is not terribly a lot but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time  For just day to day use and things like Chrome Office Word Excel Citirx EPIC etc it has been super smooth and fast  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7core GPU  Also things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27 top end with Intel chips TOUCH ID is great still  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy which makes it not work well like the old iPhone home buttons  On the other hand it should really have Face ID at this point APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA  Apple Watch easily unlocks it so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch  You can easily sendreceive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay  And so on and so forth BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 1101NOT GOOD WEBCAM still sucks  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime Teams etc  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs the 27 iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago I got one and it looks so much better than this MBAs camera ONLY 2 PORTS  Sad that this thing has only 2 USBC ports that cover thunderbolt 3 USB 31 charging DisplayPort  Given that it is used to charge it leaves only one USBC port for other use pretty lame  I wish they had squeezed I think it would fit a USBA port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USBA dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse or at least one more USBC port NEW TECH Apple silicon means the M1optimized apps are still being rolled out eg Photoshop still not available at release BATTERY still cannot be removed no surprise here but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the nonremovable battery  Easier to have an iPhones battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimumOVERALLA few negatives mostly the webcam but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a nobrainer for anyone needing a nonpower notebook compute especially if she is already in the Apple ecosystem  Love it so far,0.237,0.051,0.713,0.9995,Positive
As many others have shared the Apple MacBook Air M1 is a great laptop The display is gorgeous The keyboard is accurate and smooth Apple has the best trackpads Battery life is so good that there is no anxiety over having enough power to finish the dayThe setup experience is so good with Apple products All I had to do was choose my language and connect to wifi and then moments later the laptop was ready for me to loginThe laptop integrates so well with the other Apple devices Although I wonder why it wanted my iPhones lock screen passcode I am not sure how secure I feel that my iPhones lock screen password is shared over the air with the laptop Otherwise the MacBook Air is a great device for consuming content and for lightcreative work,0.214,0.05,0.737,0.9818,Positive

I bought this 2020 MacBook Air 8 GB RAM 256 GB SSD storage to replace a 2014 MacBook Air 4GB RAM 256 GB SSD storage  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general because they work with little fuss and are built to last note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly  Although Ive been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years this one is stellar IMHO  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choiceThe M1 processor is very impressive delivering outstanding performance and powerthermal efficiency simultaneously  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life but thats to be expected  I love the fanless design which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool  In use this computer feels very fast especially with apps optimized for Apple processors as MacOS Big Sur is  Interestingly Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that its my current default browser  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome additionThe only cons I see are minor in my opinion  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor postpurchase memory expansion is not possible if you think youll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports which is fair  For me thats not insurmountable I simply use a USBC hub to provide additional connectivity  Ive read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs  To be on the safe side I use a builtin port for charging and have had no issuesReading through the relative handful of critical reviews it looks to me like most excluding actual defects which happen with all products are based on lack of understanding  For example I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine has NO USB PORTS which is patently false  In fact its two ports are both USB they just require a different connector  What these users are looking for is the old USBA connectors which this MacBook does not have however thats easily fixed by using a USBA to USBC converter cable or with a USBC hub  USBA peripherals are gradually disappearing as well in favor of the new connectorAll things considered I really love this machine  The 899 price at the time I bought mine was 100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store and I believe I can probably get 200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air try that with a 7yearold PC leaving me with a total outlay of 699  Considering that Ill almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model Im very happy with my purchase and would do it again,0.143,0.051,0.806,0.9954,Positive

Took my chance and bought one used off Amazon warehouse deals Its brand new except the warranty has only a few months left Cant complain at all This computer is awesome as I upgraded from 2013 Macbook Pro Retina Its way faster But 8GB of ram will be slow at times and the laptop gets hot during summer months Also the trackpad has a tendency of dragging instead of clicking when youre clicking around really fast Like when youre trying to get that hot concert ticket and you click really fast on Ticketmaster it drags the text or link instead of clicking on it like it should which causes a second of two of delay I hope they get this fixed but its unlikely they will ever notice this Most people dont use trackpad to click as fast as me,0.119,0.034,0.847,0.8939,Positive

Replaced a 10 year old MacBook pro spinning harddrive onehour batter life spinning beach balls  Updates are smooth and backing up is seamless  Able to set it up to limit the tech to just what she needs right click what does that do  She was very hesitant to get a new computer as her old one works  6 months later she said she wouldnt go back  Its light with a forever battery life  Thanks Apple,0.054,0.031,0.915,0.1796,Positive

I bought this for my wife as I am a PC guy and this is a first impression review  Like all things Apple it is nice to look at with a sleek design and the screen that is sharp and clear  I always read the negative reviews and a lot of folks complained there were no USB ports  This isnt entirely true it says it comes with 2 USB C ports and it does  A simple thumb adapter 5 is all you need to use a regular USB device  HOWEVER I was expected an SD card slot that is not there  That was disappointing but again an adapter can solve that  My wife loved the fact that almost as soon as she connected to our network it almost instantly transferred everything from her phone and 10 year old MacBook  So far she is pleased with this purchase  Additional items needed  Clear protective cover and screen protector 16 adapters 10 MS Office Home for Mac 149,0.127,0.057,0.816,0.919,Positive

I decided to take a chance with MacOS and the at the time of purchase discounted Macbook Air At first I liked it a lot and was very impressed However over time I quickly grew to dislike how strict MacOS is with installing things like an overbearing parent While I personally didnt find this to be the laptop of choice I cannot deny the excellent screen insane battery life and great keyboard The usage of the Macbook Air is too limited for what I use computers for but for people with more basic needs or that use productivity apps constantly its an excellent selection It just wasnt the allrounded I had hoped it would be,0.133,0.092,0.775,0.425,Positive
Im a software developer and Ive only used PC for my entire career Ive been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and Ive always had the desire to try development on a MacI assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine thats had the OS replaced with Linux one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so thats what I expectedI bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor ms sq1 chip so I thought that I knew what to expect I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldnt work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one The M1 chip makes this 1000 laptop feel like a 2500 laptop Ive only run into one application that couldnt run and the general online community recommended an alternative for methe most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machineI might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do I couldnt ask for a better machineThe battery life is excellent this laptop feels premium I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about AppleThe biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustratingOne thing that everyone should be aware of is that you cant connect this laptop to two separate external displays I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I havent found a way to make it work with this machineGenerally speaking I would recommend this to anybody whos considering it Unless you are a PC gamer theres very little that this computer wont excel at Id argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two and I have historically been very critical of Apple,0.093,0.073,0.835,0.8617,Positive
I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13inch now since December 2020 It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops Ive ever owned I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OSWhen it comes to rendering videos and clips this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplaces gaming desktopI am pretty happy with the battery life so far I have been getting 10 hours of hard realworld usage I bring a nice USBC portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane This thing has not failed me once8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time I have not seen any throttling from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership I can even open up 30 tabs on Chrome without issue256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal Otherwise as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy you wont run into any storage issuesVirtual classes are nice The webcam quality is crystal clear and it is noticeably better than most of my peersMy only complaint is that the design is a bit outdated despite how premium and beautiful it isJust FYI I just bought two of these one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her prehistoric 2010 iMac She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMacOverall this is a very nice allaround computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level Go get this beast of a machine now for 850,0.133,0.014,0.853,0.9912,Positive

We bought the laptop in Dec 2021 After a couple of weeks it had a big OS update Big Sur to Monterey The problems started happening  I kept getting locked out passwords not working account name not working  resulting to my having to run to the Mac Service Center 2xThe first time they said the update caused some issues Second one said it was a file vault issueAlso noticed how since the update my battery life has decreased The tech guys said this is normal after an update due to the machine still settling and should stabilize soon Its been a couple of weeks and still the same Ive even heeded the advice of not logging out nor shutting down just folding the laptop to let the machine keep working on the kinks Also because its an M1 technology so no need to formally shut it down like a PCNot sure of whats really going on tbhPerhaps it is due to Apples newest OS being buggy or it could be the unit is a lemon Not sure But giving it one last chance and if it fails me again before the 90 day warranty is up I am returning it,0.037,0.05,0.913,-0.5404,Negative

Not long ago I decided to get far from Apple products because some work necessities I couldnt cover with an iPhone and a Mac The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computerI had a Samsung s10 and a Huawei Matebook pro with windows and linux Both devices are impeccable Really made my work easier in so many aspects But as time passed my life wasnt getting simpler like it was with my Iphone and my MacApple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life Quality of this products and its software is incredible Although other products have better capabilities  for example my Matebook outperforms this MacBook Air m1 and has a much better quality screen they lack the simplicity and stabilityBeing all this said The MacBook Air M1 is a really great laptop The most basic version which is the one I bought is blazing fast stable and with a great battery life much better than the Huawei Matebook pro Also its absolute silent and fresh Its doesnt get hot at allTo make my work easier I had to pay for some software that saddly I was denied to pay on the Mac at the beginning  Apple products are expensive but Ive learned that in the long run they are worth it Life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a taskI wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like I had If you have an iPhone and other Apple products dont doubt Buy a Macbook Air M1 I still have a beefy windows machine for gaming rendering and other things But most of the time I rather work in my new MacBook,0.161,0.032,0.807,0.9935,Positive

This is honestly an excellent machineNot even interested in discussing cons because there arent any if you  weigh up the price point fairly for what is arguably the best ultra portable laptop on the market right now July 21 and I dont mean the fastestThe only two thunderbolt slots can be dongled out to the max If you want a second or third monitor setup get any displaylink certified hub like the Dell 452BCYT D6000 Universal Dock pricey or the WAVLINK USB 30 Universal Laptop Docking StationUSB C to 5K Dual 4K 60Hz Video cheaperThe 7 cores of GPU on this model wont be noticed vs 8 cores The machine is a beast Im using Lumafusion to process video not even designed for MacOS but ports across from iPadOS and its 3X as fast as the iPad Pro that I own  2019Best laptop Ive ever owned and Ive owned two earlier MacBook pros a Mac mini several windows laptops and the Dell S2721Q 27 Inch 4K UHD monitor I purchased here is parked on top of the last windows machine I purchasedThe 4K dell monitor is easily crisp enough for MacOS and I purchased the keyboard used and Magic Mouse 2 new on AmazonIts been a while since Ive been on MacOS and would describe it as wonderful to use and look at after coming from windows 10 Sidecar is also amazing using the iPad Pro to the right for thatIf youre shopping for a laptop or a Mac laptop this is a good optionYoull love it Nuff said,0.137,0.006,0.857,0.9876,Positive

I love this little computer When I was looking for a laptop to buy I almost went with a used older MacBook Air I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and Im so happy I did because Apples M1 chip is impressive After two months of owning this laptop I think my favorite thing is the battery life For lighter tasks web browsing listening to music steaming Netflix etc the battery could last the entire day and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well For heavier tasks it of course doesnt last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery It rarely gets hot and doesnt even have a fan so you know how efficient that chip is running I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans I dont use it for anything crazy mainly just work and personal stuff along with frequent streaming and occasionally Ill fire up the Sims 4 and it runs beautifully by the way But Im never not impressed by how quick it is opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly Also I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone So far Im loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone,0.179,0.038,0.783,0.9926,Positive
What I liked Apples construction quality is second to none Unboxing this is a delight its just a beautiful machine You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done which might take a few minutes Love the display bright colors nice resolution everything looks crisp Keys are a delight to type with real smooth Battery life is the best Ive ever witnessed I just recharge this thing every other day whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day and I had for just one yearWhat I disliked some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip Its given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows and some 23 years using Linux I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn control option  command keys properlyAll in all its a really solid laptop although I feel like I still havent made the most out of it No heavy usage so far except for some minor audio production work Guess Ill do it eventually Hope app compatibility gets better with time too thats the reason for the missing star up there otherwise it wouldve been 5stars all the way,0.181,0.06,0.759,0.9843,Positive

So for the most part I use this for when I am traveling or out and about for my business I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Macs as storage for information so this doesnt use storage much at all Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max Honestly you cant get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product,0.165,0.011,0.824,0.9897,Positive

Ive worked on and serviced Macs for many years but Ive never considered purchasing one for the price Macs have never been a good value I wanted a 1000 laptop and my choices quickly narrowed to this It has the best laptop processor and the best screen money can buy especially at this price The battery life on MacBooks is always good so I knew that wouldnt be an issueAfter purchase Ive come to the same conclusions The screen is wonderful Bright and high res excellent color accuracy The M1 processor speed has blown me away with its performance I dont need much RAM or Storage so Im still happy with that I do wish for more RAM but I dont necessarily need it for my work I do What has blown my mind more than anything else is the battery life Ive never had a laptop like this I dont have to carry a charger with me anymore the MacBook easily handles a full day of charge I also like the fact that it doesnt have a fan I dont have to worry about thermals when getting comfy in my bed and doing some light workOverall best laptop Ive ever purchased Ive had no issues over more than a month of ownership and Im super picky about tech as well as slightly antiApple so Ive basically converted because of this machine,0.201,0.071,0.727,0.9919,Positive

So forget about all the other reviews This is the skinny from a higher learning teacher Is it fast Yes If you are browsing the web watching videos etc Its faster than my MSI with 16gb ram and RTX 2060 video card Is it silent YES Its the whole reason I bought it so good for me How is rendering audio or video Good BUTMy iMac 5k from 2017 with 4gb of video ram is faster with the few renderings I have done The following is what surprised me especially after reading all the fab reviews of battery I put my Mac Air on sleep mode when I shut it down Didnt use it for a couple days came back to get it and the battery was completely dead Zero I was VERY surprised  I can always leave an MSI Lenovo HP on sleep mode for a week or more Those are the things I have experienced in my first week Hope it helps,0.143,0.046,0.811,0.9441,Positive
I have buyers regret now  I bought this to update from my old Mac Pro and was hoping I could get some streaming apps like Netflix Hulu etc and none of that is available  I use my laptop for movies and TV while traveling  No CD drive and none of the aforementioned items make this laptop basically useless to me,0.083,0.122,0.796,-0.3612,Negative
I looked at a lot of different laptops and went to my local Best Buy for in person testing before deciding on this one  I work from home and have been using a older model HP that was passed down to me that had a hour and a half battery life a plastic shell and froze endlesslyThis laptop is real clean looking feels solid has insane battery life and the screen is absolutely insane  Watching videos on it is unreal and have had no issues running multiple programsdesktopsand some gaming on it  I purchased the base model and run it with an external hard drive to keep the space clear on itI love how all the apple products interact seamlessly with each other and the sidecar feature that links it to the iPad to work as a second screen on the goIn the future would be nice to see the bezels slimmed down the keyboard have a little more weight to it MacBook Air speakers amped up a bit and a higher quality camera and all those things are near perfect  Ill be holding on to this for the next 5 years plus,0.108,0.059,0.833,0.9001,Positive

I hate laptops until I bought this one anyway I probably burned through over a dozen  or so over the past decade One of them was actually another Mac Air I wasnt impressed This 2020 model however provides all the power and versatility that Ive only previously dreamed about  The Retina display is gorgeous clear and easy to read This PC runs Photoshop faster and cleaner than desktops that cost me 3000 or more Music played back on this little laptop sounds better than any other Ive heard  The new Apple M1 chip really shines beating the Intel versions of this laptop hands down,0.142,0.082,0.776,0.7169,Positive
I replaced on older 2009 MacBook Pro with this new model from Apple It has the new M1 chip and it is fast For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast I dont do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive Love the screen clarity I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better I dont have any negatives with this computer I have been an Apple fan for several years now and so use to it that I have great difficulty when trying to use a Windows based computer,0.135,0.034,0.831,0.9656,Positive
I had previously purchased a renewed MacBook Air and it wasnt exactly what I would call renewed I returned it and found a new MacBook Air for under 900 Only a few hundred more than someone elses old one and I couldnt be happier Ive had iPhones since 3GS and they have always been user friendly and the MacBook Air is just like my iPhone but betterI have always had windows and the last one installed the manufacturer update and afterwards I could not log into the computer Thats the end of windows and the beginning of my Mac attackI highly recommend this item especially if you are able to purchase it for under 900,0.067,0.017,0.916,0.686,Positive

I have had my new MacAir not quite two weeks and it is even better than I expected  This one is with the new M1 chip and is an upgrade from my previous Macwhich I loved  Faster better more battery  Whats not to like  And frankly the price for the machine is a bargain  I do not use my Mac for gaming heavy downloads large graphics so cant comment but is why the Air is a perfect choice over the Pro  Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my old Mac on the M1 so everything works better  I was a bit surprised everything is the same size and weightbut thats likely because I didnt look at those specs before purchase  One sweet thing about the Mac is it comes about 70 charged so just open and start  If you are considering a Mac or have one and are thinking about upgrade just do it  And Amazon made it easyarrived in two days,0.142,0.021,0.836,0.9652,Positive
Buying into the Apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money but do not make them a critical part of your workflow  They are too expensive for that  Apple just does not make good computers  Yes they make a OK operating system but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones inYou cant just go and buy the parts to fix your Mac computers when they break  The MacBook Air is no exception to this  The SSD is solider to the motherboard  Likewise the RAM  Now if that were the only problem well  one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after Apple stop warranty coverage  maybe  But they dont even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public  So once the warranty is up  you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer  Needless to say this is a major flaw in Apple products  of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air  Oh and if they start allowing suppliers to supply but lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more ewasteAlso this computer flickers with a 4K output  The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that Ive used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old  This is unacceptable  Apples response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USBC docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushingThough poorly engineered in terms of video ssd and RAM  It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard  If you are willing to let that guide you then the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine  Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update  good for themEven though I dislike the Mac it is better than most laptops  because it is quiet since it has no fan  Would I buy one again Perhaps  it is a question of whether I think the market exists for me to make money off of itThe good thingsKeyboard touchpad BuiltIn Screen BuildIn Speakers Drives External Audio better than Microsoft Windows and the Operating System is less cluttered than is Windows  Also comes with a Spreadsheet Word Processor Presentation Program  now it is better just to use something really Libre  like LibreOffice  But it is kind of nice the table steaks are included  unlike for Microsoft Windows,0.091,0.087,0.822,0.4757,Positive
I wanted a new MacBook since its been several years since I got my last Mac and the battery was going badWith a delicious gold color and an overall thin sleek design this computer is for those who want their computer to look a bit more fancy than other options on the marketWith the M1 chip everything is extremely fast I was able to set up this new machine with 10 minutesI am not sure if I would recommend this machine to those who have recently upgraded to a Mac 2017 to now but if its been several years and you want to splurge go for thisAs a writer the keyboard is so smooth and I feel like I can type more words per minute on this machineMy only complaint is the webcam while better is still not up to par to other computer cameras on the market FaceTime looks a bit grainy still and Photo Booth is just a joke The quality barely looks different than recent modelsOverall this is a great addition to the Mac family I look forward to see how Apple utilizes the M1 chip in the future83100,0.115,0.022,0.863,0.9514,Positive

This is my first Mac It was not hard to get used to it as the laptop itself works great and has all the features needed The battery life is extreme Way longer than I expected it also charges real quick Nice that it uses a USB C plug to charge it can be plugged in at any USB C plug The only thing is that it only has two USB C ports No SD or micro SD reader I used an external Seagate hard drive with my windows laptop and now use it with the mac just had to download free software from Seagate The hard drive has 2 USB A ports that I can use to connect some of my devices that dont have a USB C plug But this MacBook Air is super cool The camera and microphone have great picture and sound quality I have not even had a need to use my external Blue mic yet,0.146,0.019,0.835,0.963,Positive
I appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value  The package was secure and wellpackaged which was very important given that this was delivered via mail  No cracks on the screen  The processing speed is quick which is extremely helpful  I appreciate there were instructions in a small pamphlet that explained how to transfer everything from your previous MacBook to this MacBook  A seamless transition is vital and means less frustration  This MacBook Air is very user friendly especially visually  As someone who wears glasses I appreciate the option to make the pointer larger the ability to have more contrast etc  That the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more userfriendly,0.225,0.036,0.739,0.9731,Positive
But I love this laptop  After asking multiple people who have purchased the same or better models and I couldnt be happier purchasing even the lowest end model of MacBook Air  Does everything I would expect an Apple Computer to do for what I need it for basic photo editing viewing and typing So far its been an amazing purchase  Just for the sake of keeping Apple on their toes I rated the Battery Life 4 stars and the camera quality 4 stars as well as the 4 star overall review  Keep it up Apple as long as you continue to make the products userfriendly Ill remain a happy customer for years to come,0.173,0.083,0.744,0.9298,Positive

Best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why Apple is trying to punish me for but its fine Also be really careful because the screen is special it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks Sound is boxy Id recommend SpeakerAmp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound But nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment,0.22,0.107,0.672,0.92,Positive

What a great improvement over my old MacBook Pro This is my third such computer It keeps me in touch with the world and Amazon What bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords I must come up with to access other sites which is why I use Amazon almost exclusively There are so many goodies on this one that I will probably use only a few though it is made for the new generation of users Great product Thanks Applel,0.202,0.0,0.798,0.9477,Positive

Im giving this a 5 star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great however I watched multiple YouTube videos glorifying the M1 chip as being fast enough that 8GB could handle a ton of open applications I need a bunch of tabs open for my work use Canva constantly and occasionally need to open Photoshop too so I needed to return this and buy 16GB But thats my fault and the YouTube reviews faults not the laptop Battery life is amaaaazing though,0.095,0.083,0.822,-0.2263,Negative
We own a MacBook Pro but needed a second laptop to keep the marriage from going off the tracks  Bought the MacBook Air and are very pleased  Its lighter than our pro has similar performance is a bit lighter and cheaper  The only negative is that its two USBC ports are on one side makes it trickier to keep it plugged in our seating situation  Probably not an issue for most  Oh the battery life seems better than the Pro  Definitely recommend it,0.156,0.074,0.771,0.8334,Positive

Nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated 7 GPU Core version Feeling deceived In addition the 8 GB RAM  256GB SSD Version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing Having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death With a regular set of apps like the MS Office suite the disk fills up in no time Now OS updates are not working since they require at least 15 GB disk space But  battery life is out of this world with the CPU temp sitting at 36C,0.032,0.083,0.885,-0.5994,Negative

I have to reset this thing at least 5 times per week in the middle of meetings and such for no reason Ive done all the updates and its brand new it just doesnt work Im guessing this has to do with the fact that it has an Apple chip instead of an Intel one and like most things Apple actually makes its glitchy and unreliable Makes sense that it was on sale If you have to buy an Apple try to get the ones that have the fewest Apple parts as possible,0.027,0.023,0.95,0.0772,Positive

The MacBook Air is convenient like every other computer used daily and is compactible due to size It goes for the high price of thirteen hundred dollars with very little features besides its editing equipment The computers processing chip isnt the best on the market which makes the computer work slow a while after using Its a simple use for a computer with very little storage but it keeps things organized and easy to find Sometimes files tend to glitch out of the memory causing me to redo a few assignments The screen has a clear picture which makes it better when having to read and do homework The computer itself is very clean and simple to use but doesnt come with feature that most highpriced computer have  After paying a heavy amount on a computer the features it has is limited compared to buying an iPad for the same price,0.106,0.029,0.865,0.9232,Positive

I was able to snag one of these for 700 with the M2 MacBook Air arriving the day after I am writing this review If it was in this price bracket all the time it would be a no brainer best choice and I am having a hard time finding worthy competition even at its 1000 msrp rangeWhat it does wellTrackpad  The trackpad on the MacBook Air is unbelievable Using pressure sensitivity to simulate clicks on a piece of glass the MacBook lineup puts all other laptop manufacturers on notice This is a best in class experienceKeyboard  Say what you will about laptop keyboards but this is a phenomenal typing experience The only type of keyboard I would rather be using is a mechanical keyboard but in this form factor it is as good as it gets The only complaints I have are that the arrow keys are really smallDisplay  The display provides a fantastic viewing experience I thought this is where the laptop would fall behind its more expensive counterparts with OLED and Mini LED displays but the color accuracy respectable 400 nit peak brightness and 2560 x 1600 resolution are leaps better than anything I have experienced on an HP or Lenovo device I wish the display was slightly bigger but do not mind using it at all This is a very good display for the moneyBuild Quality  Apple just continues to excel at building thingsSpeakers  Solid speakers with exceptional clarity volume and bass Better than anything I have owned before itWhat it does badGaming  Do not buy this laptop with the hopes that you can game on it Most games I thought of installing were not available on Mac OS It is in this category that Windows dominates the marketIO  You get 2 USB C ports and a headphone jack This fits my lifestyle just fine but I cannot speak for everyone It is up to you to determine whether you can live without USB A HDMI out or SD Readers built inBase Hardware  At this price point 256gb is not enough 512 should be the standard not a 160 add on,0.151,0.021,0.827,0.9937,Positive

Through the past year and a half students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks most importantly being school From my personal experience I believe that the MacBook Air 2020 is the best tool for the job If you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future the MacBook Air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage ability to keep a charge and the apple compatibility that it usesFirst the MacBook Air 2020 is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged In my school days I did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer Now I do not have to do that at all because I only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its 30 hour charge Next the apple compatibility that it uses including Apple music iMessage Facetime etc makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text This apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so Finally is the processing speed and storage The MacBook Air 2020 has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer This makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life Although it is expensive the MacBook Air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the MacBooks including computers such as the MacBook Pro The strange thing that the MacBook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel The storage that is available with the MacBook is 256GB 512GB 1TB or 2TB but most went with 512GB These large amounts of storage are fantastic showing that one of the MacBook Airs biggest competitorsDell XPS 13 only lets you choose between 128GB and 256GB Now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just wont cut it For these reasons the MacBook Air 2020 is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage ability to keep a charge and the apple compatibilityOverall the MackBook Air has the processing speed storage capacity battery life and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer Throughout the last year and a half I have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things Getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience,0.095,0.013,0.892,0.9916,Positive

When I was in college I used both mac and PC and after I graduated I switched exclusively to PC because of the versatility gaming and upgradability When I decided to go back to grad school I decided to give Apple another chance with this laptop because I heard great things and high expectation with the new m1 chip design I was not disappointedThis new CPU has great speeds and this macbook air runs fantastic for daily moderate use browsing the web watching videos reading studying etc  I can go to a cafe and use this laptop all day without having to charge it Also its so compact and thin that its easy to take everywhere compared to my old macbook from 2012 it is incredibly light I always had the notion that apple made heavy laptops but this definitely is easy to carry aroundAs someone who used a desktop the keyboard was a bit harder to adapt to The keys dont have a deep switch as a normal keyboard has but considering the size of the laptop it is expected I can see it being an issue with its small screen Although it is convenient for me the size can be inconvenient for those hard of sight Lastly the price is steep for a laptop A PC variant with this money can be used to buy a gaming laptop where Apple normally lacks but I have yet to try the Apple Arcade on my macbook air It is also only USBC which is a turnoff to many but with a dongle it is not a problem for meI would say if you are looking for a laptop to work or study with this is an easy grab Make sure you buy a dongle along side of itTLDRPros battery life m1 chip size easy to carry around weightCons keyboard size screen is a bit small for some price only USBC,0.102,0.015,0.883,0.9793,Positive
I was hesitant to get a smaller Macbook after my 15 2015 Macbook Pro started to suffer from keyboard issues  I repaired the keyboard twice so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to itAnyhow I couldnt resist the idea of an ARM based Macbook so I went with the 2020 13 Macbook Air since I dont think the Pro model had Apple Silicon yet  I could be wrong on thatLong story short it meets all my needs with flying colors  It turns out that Im perfectly comfortable with a 13 screen and that I dont need a bigger oneEverything great about this Macbook Its fast  Dont let the Air moniker deceive you  Unless youre into heavy gaming this is the laptop for you  ARM processors are the future of consumer computing The battery life is insane  I still cant comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged  I take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that I will run out of power even when Im charging my phone off it Its slim and light  Perfect for traveling It is completely solid state with no moving parts  No fan whirring or anything like that As an extension of the first point it runs ARM builds of Windows insanely well with Parallels  It can even run Halo CE at near full speed macOS is very stable The retina screen is nice Despite what people are saying about the camera its actually better than the one on my old Macbook Pro  this isnt to say that the camera is good but its adequate IMO All things considered the M1 Macbook Air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price It has a larger touchpad than my old Macbook Pro but not quite as bit as the one on current 13 Macbook Pros  I find this preferable because it is just the right size where Im not constantly hitting it with my palm as I type  If you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area No touchbar  Halleluja Decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraintThere are some cons but they are pretty minor IMO Only the left side has USBC ports in contrast to the Pro which has them on both sides  The right side does have an analog audio jack however if thats useful to you  However Ive managed fine without USB on the right side It would be nice if I didnt have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system  On pros the fingerprint sensor is always active If you are one of the 3 people on the planet who want the touchbar this will not have it I however consider this a good thing Although the speakers have improved in quality since previous Air models the Pro is still going to have better sounding speakers  You may feel like youve gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a Pro model  Personally Ive gotten used to it plus I use AirPods most of the time anyway The Air does NOT have an HDMI port but you can buy an expensive adapter that will provide HDMI Storage capacity is workable but limited  Would be nice to get at least 1 TB of storage in the future  In the meantime I just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folderIm a software engineer and the M1 Macbook Air exceeds my needs and expectations  I think Ill just be buying the Air model in the future because its terrific value for the price point  999 might be expensive for some but I can assure you that its a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run  Ive owned many nonApple laptops in the past and I ended up hating all of them  On the other hand I never regret owning an Apple device  This is coming from someone who formerly used Windows and Linux  I got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly  Apple isnt perfect my last Macbook Pro chugged along for over 6 years until the keyboard repeatedly failed but that still beats all previous laptops I owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how I treated them,0.121,0.062,0.818,0.9929,Positive

I am a lifelong fan of all things Apple  That being said after using this laptop for a little over a month I am still impressed with how awesome this laptop is  The battery life alone leaves me in awe  I bought this laptop to use as an online student  Starting with the battery fully charged I am easily able to complete all of my online coursework and have plenty of battery power left to stream a movie or two afterwards  I actually purchased my MacBook Air M1 laptop directly from Apple so I would get the student discount  I did choose to upgrade my RAM to the 16 GB for an additional 180 and that did cause delivery to take a little longer  Totally worth it though  I have not done anything yet on this laptop to really stresstest it but I have had multiple webpages in the browser and multiple documents open in Word and PDF docs open with iBooks and Preview  I have had no problems at all switching between open web sites apps or docs  The only time I started to notice any hint of a problem it turns out it was because we lost power and therefore our home WiFi was temporarily unavailable so it had nothing to do with the laptopWhile it is a minor inconvenience that Netflix is not available for download thru the app store at this time Oct 2021 it is easy enough to access their streaming service thru the browser  The built in speakers are plenty loud enough but it is quite easy to use your AirPods if you preferI highly recommend this MacBook Air M1 to anyone especially students looking for a laptop that has a battery that will actually keep up with them all day long without constantly needing to find a power outlet,0.068,0.062,0.871,0.1997,Positive

Ive owned this laptop for a year and a half and felt compelled to take time out of my frantic day to note that I really think this computer is a giant step backward for the Macbook Air model and for Macintosh as a brand compared to my old 2013 Macbook Air running YosemiteThe lack of a magsafe connection for the charger is really unforgivable and this computer has wound up on the floor so frequently that I now have placed the dog bed where the laptop is likely to land  The keys are beginning to stick  The screen is beautiful but gives me a terrible headache  The memory pressure issue with the M1 is also a real problem in Safari which locks up about every three weeks if you have a lot of windows open and it take a LONG time to force quit safely and recover lost work  The laptop is also too big that extra inch or so of width really makes a difference  The loss of practical functionality in iTunes is really disappointing iMovie and Garage band have become much MUCH harder to use in Big Sur as well and Apples insistence on trying to force me into using the kloud is both intensely irritating and very dangerous for my business where confidentiality is absolutely criticalIt is true that the processing speed for offline tasks is impressive my music projects do sound much better and photo and video editing is greatBut the M1s speed is not enough of a reason for me to bond with this computer  As the months have rolled by honestly Ive come to kind of hate it  Im looking forward to refurbishing my old Macbook Air and Im thinking this may be the last Apple product that I buy even though I cant think of a suitable alternativeI am a 64year old professional health care provider who has been in IT since the early 1980s and while its true that I have generally been very unhappy with how gratuitously awful the enduser interface of most tech products have become over the last quarter century there are some computers that I have actually liked my old Macbook Air was definitely one of them  This is definitely not,0.109,0.116,0.775,-0.469,Negative
Im new to Macbooks having used Windows my whole life I chose this for going back to school because I knew it would last longer and not get buggy like Windows always does While the transition was a bit rocky at first now that I somewhat know what Im doing I absolutely love this computer Its small and lightweight but still feel solid in your hands The processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time I can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds literally no joke something I could never do with a Windows laptop I should mention that I bought my computer directly from Apple and upgraded to the 16BG RAM and more storage which helps immensely with load up time For those that say the camera is bad I dont think so Is it the most amazing camera ever No but if you really need higher camera quality for your job then you should probably go with a Macbook Pro instead of Air For a Zoom meeting it works just fine The price is obviously higher than many laptops thats why Ive never used Mac until now but just think of it as an investment I know Ill be able to use this for years to comeIf you are looking for an efficient reliable laptop with great performance look no further,0.125,0.073,0.801,0.9334,Positive
I bought my Macbook Pro in 2013 which makes it 8 years old Its still going strong I did have to replace the battery a few years back I did it myself bit of a pain as Apple locks their stuff down pretty well It looks like Apple will drop support for this late 2012 model next year Thats when Ill get a new one Not bad for close to 10 years for one machine About a hundred bucks a year,0.19,0.093,0.717,0.8151,Positive
Before I begin Id like to clarify that I purchased this MacBook on ApplecomI was kind of reluctant at first to purchase a MacBook due to the expensive pricing But it was heard that apple products are long lasting and really good quality Ive had Chromebook for 3 years and the quality is not amazing Ive had to bring it for repair multiple times It also shut down randomly But not with this MacBookThe MacBook is soo beautiful and sleek The rose gold color is so elegant and the keys are amazing At the top right hand corner there is a small button that enables Touch ID which is so convenient and easy to workBy just saying hey Siri my automated assistant is summoned and will help me with whatever I need It comes with so many apps And so many ways to customize your MacBookI changed my profile photo set a quote on my Lock Screen changed my wallpapers made widgets changed my highlight color accent colors and much much moreIts so convenient for me to have my zooms open in one browser and the pages app open in another so I can take notes while my teachers gives lessonsAs shown in the pictures if you update your MacBook with Big Sur you can download Widgetsmith and customize widgets My entire MacBooks aesthetic is so elegant and I just love it Comparing this to laptops like HP and Dell as well as Google there are limited ways you can customize your laptop to your likingI asked a couple of friends and family members who have MacBooks and they have had them for 5 years without having to take their MacBooks for repair I am hoping this will be my case as wellI can now message anyone from the messages app and the mail appThe camera quality is great too Its touched up my appearance with zoom and Google meet and Ive heard if you want a MacBook to edit the pro is the way to go because the storage is biggerThe battery life is so great too Ive used it for 6 hours starting at 9am to 430 pm It started at 45 percent and it only went down to 30Buying a MacBook will not water your money I am loving every second of my use Thank you Apple ,0.182,0.028,0.79,0.9973,Positive

My son loved his Apple laptop while it worked The screen has cracked twice As we can see from the image it cracks from the top middle where Apple put the camera My son used the laptop a lot but he did not mistreat his laptop I generally do favor Apple products Apple already repaired this once I paid nothing for that repair However it has now failed twice for the same issue I feel this is a serious engineering defect I likely will take it to Apple so they can diagnose it I dont particularly care if I get the laptop back or not at this point since I suspect it may break again within six months Unfortunately I cannot recommend the Apple Macbook Air due to this defect I do expect a laptop to last at least 2 or 3 years Apple normally makes great products and I hold Apple in high esteem This product unfortunately is not one of them Not all of the Apple laptops will face this issue But if you search the web you will find others who have experienced this same problem I am hoping Apple stress tests newer versions of their laptops to address this issue in the future Apple may need to modify the camera assembly or display assembly Or relocate the camera to a different location like the corner of the display,0.079,0.138,0.783,-0.9298,Negative

The MacBook Air is a great purchase for a laptop It has many new features that will be helpful for school and work The laptop is affordable portable and has the new M1 chip The way the laptop is affordable is because you will be able to pay for it monthly so you will not spend all your money at once You will also be getting what you pay for with its latest features It is also portable because it is light weight and slim This will help you carry it anywhere you need to and will be very helpful if you go to college since you will be carrying from class to class Lastly it has a new M1 processing chip This M1 chip makes it better than any past MacBooks it keeps you laptop running smooth and fast it also gives you long battery life I really do recommend you purchase the MacBook Air it is worth buying,0.118,0.016,0.866,0.953,Positive
I have both an iPad and iPhone so I thought is would be make sense to have a Mac so everything is in one ecosystem as it were  To some extent this has indeed proved true and useful  I am coming from a Surface Pro 7  The Mac Airs battery life is much less than advertised  The claim is around 10 hours I doubt I get 5 and I am mostly doing internet browsing and Word stuff  Battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on Zoom  The battery life of the Surface is better  Word for Mac is a little different than Word for a PC but the differences are minor and manageable  But documents open more slowly on the Mac and mine has the M1 chip  On the Surface documents usually open immediately  On the Mac it might take 5 seconds not an eternity but a little annoying  The Surface boots up much faster than the Mac  I have a DVD with a number of workouts on it  I could not get any individual workouts to open using the Macs native software  So I downloaded VLC  It works fine on the Mac but takes a long time to open about a minute  This seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the App store including Firefox  There do not appear to be Mac apps for either  On the other hand the Mac has a better screen than the Surface  While the Surface is quite a good laptop it is a marginal tablet and I almost never use it as a tablet  When I am not sitting at a desk I prefer the Mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a Surface  The new Mac keyboard works great maybe a tie with the Surface  So a mixed bag  As I mentioned I like having everything in one ecosystem so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the Mac  I am mulling over upgrading to the MacBook Pro 13 because of its bigger battery but dont know if I want to spend the extra money,0.111,0.022,0.867,0.9858,Positive

I absolutely love my new MacBook  When it arrived I answered a few questions connected it to my WiFi and off I went  It has been a buttery smooth experience  Keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences but for me its the best feeling keyboard I have ever owned  Many professional reviewers agree its terrific The multitouch pad is brilliant and now that I know the many different combinations of fingers and movements I zip around getting work done  For example a twofinger swipe right goes back to the previous web page no need to hit that back button  It is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs What I appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value  I bought Final Cut Pro X when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the App Store It does everything I need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have  I still cant get used to how fast it works it took me an hour to render a video on my old Mac but this MacBook did it in just a few minutes  And its cool and quiet Im using a huge 70 4K monitor as my secondary monitor  Battery life is ridiculous  I plug it in every 2 or 3 days depending on my workload which is several hours per day  I think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same 720p size  I join one Zoom conference per week so it doesnt really matter The one thing I hope gets updated with the next release are the ports  Im using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports I recommend this notebook to all my friends and family,0.17,0.04,0.79,0.9923,Positive

I love Linux i can tolerate windows usually dont like Mac Its fine folks like what they like for me Linux gives the most choice is extensible and runs so fast on even older hardware you get infinite support you dont get harassed to use cortana siri candy crush itunes etc etc  Mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really dont like it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a painwell here we are in 2021 I mainly work on linux these days and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office i need that i am not doing windows development these days I know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows not with mac   for my use case so i tried it gave it another shot really My timing was seemingly really good these computer are fantastic You know what i hate about laptops when they are 150 degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on I hate that i really do All of my laptops do this The mac M1 I am pleased to report doesnt Screw performance i mean thats great here but the quiet and note heat thats the featureThis is coming from someone that doesnt want to like Apple They outsource all these jobs their stuff is over priced right Im not so  sure about the price here You can buy a mac pro 13 inch thats faster than an i9 for 1500 if you get 16gb and the battery is amazing no heat no fan the sound is great the screen is great the keyboard is great its not a lenovo but other than that its about as good as you can get This machine is so well thought out I got the pro the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound and boosted batterybut if you dont need that you can just get the air which doesnt have the horrible touch bar Dont get me wrong the touch bar would be fine IN ADDITION to normal keys thats where they went wrong here they got greedy I digress The only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks It needs ports on both sides and at least 2x portsAll these reviews are usually full of crap Its just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction or they are sort marketing This time its true This architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space I m not sure if this will translate to a desktop risc vs cisc isnt new it been going on for decades but  for laptops this is a quantum leap I dont see any reason for the work im doing to use a desktop computer a this point i have complete portability i can take calls amazing calls work on ms office general development vscode all the jetbrains stuff docker etc i mean for a lot of system stuff ill still use Id still use linux but for work this is a great way to go What a great product It really really is This i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive After 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with TPM chips mics no being able to share my screen pleading with my computer to use the right audio device I like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by farThis thing is really just that good Ive been i this industry for a long time There are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines if Apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber I have no question this one is going to eat market share fast Id imagine there will be a strong response fro Intel amd and the software companies  Its difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment I mean just get the air for 1200 just get the extra ram maybe 500 gb Thats all most people are going to need Who cares if they release better ones in 6 months they always do theyll probably cost too much this is all you need,0.166,0.089,0.745,0.9974,Positive

Beware  reliability and customer support is gone  I bought a MacBook Air about 2 years ago From the beginning it malfunctioned intermittently failing to allow me to access any other apps besides the one I was using  I worked with numerous Apple technicians who also witnessed the problem  After hours and hours over months of patiently working with them I was told wed try a complete replacement of the OS and if that didnt work Id get a replacement When it didnt I was told Id now have to take disk images and record dates and times it failed Theyd have the engineers get involved  The engineers for one faulty laptop after Id been patient for two years doing everything they asked and they witnessed the problem  Two years hours upon hours of my life and a false commitment to make it right Ive been a Mac user for decades  No longer  Given the premium price  AppleCare I feel cheated and so disappointed  Ill be looking for a new nonApple laptop,0.04,0.146,0.814,-0.9588,Negative
Heres my indepth review of the M1 MacBook Air Dont get confused by the color Amazon said on top its a gold color and bought it off Best BuyProcessorThis thing has a blazingfast M1 system on a chip 32 GHz The bootup times are so short and apps launch instantly Also apps are incredibly smoothDisplayThis has a Retina display Its the best laptop display YouTube videos come to life If you zoom in on this Macs screen the pixels are so small and so close together that the human eye cant even distinguish them so type looks razor sharp Thats the moral of the iPad 3rd Gen guysAudio and MicrophoneIn short terms the audio and microphone audio are both REALLY clear Im pretty sure these are stereo speakersDescriptionOverall the best notebook we ever had You cannot go wrong with this purchase,0.194,0.0,0.806,0.9829,Positive

The only computers Ive ever owned have been Macs starting with a Mac SE in 1987 This is the first time Ive bought one that has mainly made me angryI quickly discovered that I couldnt plug it into my printer because it doesnt have a USB port so I had to buy a USBC to USB adapter 19I also cant charge it using any of the chargers around my house from my old MacBooks or my husbands MacBook so in order to have an extra charger I had to pay 49 When it arrived I realized it didnt come with a cord Another order another 19And Apple is no longer using MagSafe connectors so if you accidentally hit the cord with your foot or whatever the cord doesnt just pop out of the computer Instead it drags your computer with it Yesterday just a month after getting my expensive new computer I dragged it to the floor and broke the screen Itll cost me 500 to get it fixed if I dont decide to throw it into a dumpsterI now officially hate Apple Whats especially annoying is that theyve successfully addicted me to their products and I know Im not going to change brands at this point in my life so Im going to keep having to put up with this kind of crap from Apple plus how theyre always trying to invade my privacy and force me to use iCloud and how their software now tries to make way too many decisions for meIm writing this review on my old 2015 MacBook Air and even though its slower than the new MacBook and the display is smaller and not as nice Im wondering if I really want to fix my new MacBook,0.016,0.081,0.903,-0.9441,Negative
I have had this MacBook Air in the gold color for a few months now This is actually my very first MacBook I absolutely LOVE it First of all it is gorgeous I am a sucker for cute packaging or a cute product and this laptop is just stunning I have never seen a beautiful laptop until I got thisThe performance is amazing as well Super long battery life I rarely have to charge it Super thin Never gets hot Super fast The 4k performance is beautiful I would buy this again in a heartbeat Definitely worth the price  I looked at all of the MacBooks in person before buying and the Air is just stunning with its thin design Did not like the looks of the Pro models,0.278,0.077,0.645,0.9846,Positive
The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip is overall amazing Its definitely worth the money The allnew chipset has turned the Air lineup into a beast My only complaint is the camera Apple has stuck to the same 720p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better Im not convinced its any better and its really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class Also the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard Its adjustable from the settings and easily accessible but its just an inconvenience Its a petty complaint but for the money this should be standard it previously was on older models Aside from that this notebook is amazing Lightning fast and the best battery life Ive ever seen Overall if youre in the Apple ecosystem and youre looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life  this is the one for you,0.166,0.097,0.737,0.9346,Positive
Purchased this laptop in November half a year ago but did not really start using until the spring semester end of January About a month ago I randomly opened my laptop to find colored lines across the screen No damage to the phone as most my classes were remote and I was using my computer on my desk It ended up going away on its own after shutting it down for 2 hours but lines continue to reappear every few days or so then disappear after I let it rest I looked it up online and it seems to be a hardware issue but I do not know how to fix this since I did not cause the problem Never installed anything additional on my laptop besides google chrome and R software for research Do not go through Amazon to purchase mac products,0.02,0.082,0.897,-0.8297,Negative

First I will say I bought this at an Apple store not on Amazon  So this is a review of the product  For many years I have found Apple products to be overrated and overpriced  That includes this product  For example as others have stated  no good ports you need to buy all kinds of attachments no touchscreen etc  And of course there are compatibility issues with anything not made by Apple  But my biggest beef is that it is not reliable  I recently downloaded Monterey  and am having all kinds of problems  I find all these 5 star reviews hard to believe,0.034,0.094,0.872,-0.626,Negative

I traded in my previous MacBook Air for the current version with the M1 chip I have only had it for four days and all I can say is wow I didnt think I would notice much of a difference but I am very impressed with the speed and the battery life of this new edition I mainly use my laptop for emailing paying bills and web browsing and I purchased this model instead of the Pro because I dont edit or shoot videos This model is perfect for my needs,0.159,0.0,0.841,0.9392,Positive
If you purchase the MacBook Air with the M1 chip YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RUN WINDOWS ALONG WITH MAC OS  If your buying specifically to just use the Mac OS  dont have a problem not being able to run Windows or any program that runs on Windows then this system is a good Apple product  If you are like myself or want the option like you SHOULD JUST HAVE as has always been offered in the past with processors before the M1 and run Windows on a partitioned drive either with MAC OS or boot up into Windows instead the M1 chip now takes that ability to do so away  The MacBook Air itself with the M1 chip now that theyve finally incorporated the ability to run iPhone apps on it is in itself a huge breakthrough  That was overall my biggest frustration with using MacBooks by a long shot  And it seems theyve fixed that now so on one end impressive if your simply not needing Windows or anything that runs in the Windows environment of course,0.112,0.031,0.856,0.9122,Positive

This is our second Macbook Air  The first one lasted nearly 5 years and was a rocksolid laptop The new m1 machines are garbage Do some research on the internet The screens break and Apple denies there is a problem  We have had this one for about 8 months and the screen just broke a second time  Ive paid 200 for Apple care and 100 twice to replace a screen  We did NOTHING to the screen no signs of abuse a bump a scratch NOTHING just open one day and the screen is black and pixelated The break is internal When its not broken its a great computer  Just be ready to buy it several times over replacing the screenmIf you are already a victim there are law firms taking cases  Apple ought to step up and just deal with the defect  Forcing customers that have been loyal to the brand to join in a class action suit in order to deal with the know and ongoing problem is awful  Too bad they are so big they just dont care,0.084,0.158,0.758,-0.9318,Negative
Upgraded from Mid 2015 base Macbook Air This thing is like 100x faster It is amazing I got used to the USBC and bought a little hub that makes it a non issue Actually like it better since USB C is faster Battery life on my old MacBook was amazing This one is literally at least double that Pro tip do not use chrome on any Mac or MacBook it is energy and efficient and will kill your battery took me a while to learn this Webcam is only bad part but all Macbooks have substandard webcams compared to iPhones I got the base model and do NOT regret it one bet I saved a ton of money on one less core and I do NOT notice a difference heard its 10 or less This thing is razor thin,0.142,0.036,0.822,0.9062,Positive

Apple makes an incredible product But their contempt for the customer knows no end This is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the MacBook Aires and even some Powerbooks And EVERYTHING is put into those two The separate power port is gone The separate video out port is gone In some cases even the audio out port is gone All they leave you with is two USB ports which they expect you to use for everything For a lot of people like myself multiple ports are needed for constant use They are needed for external hard drives especially for file backup where you dont want to use the Apple Cloud which is susceptible to NSA snooping external DVD and CD burners special printers that do NOT work with Bluetooth special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult drawing pads etc etc etc And dont tell me to just get an external hub I have tried them all and NONE of them provide proper power to external tools that need it Plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker In summation Apple needs to start giving consideration to the Customers needs and not just to some fancy updated technology Bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools We NEED physical ports Please put them back on the MacBooks especially the Aires And stop taking them off of the Mac Cubes The last one I bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work PLEASE APPLE BRING BACK THE PORTS Otherwise I may be forced God forbid to go back to Microsoft computers,0.081,0.111,0.808,-0.8264,Negative
I was using a 2015 MacBook Pro for doing video editing for my church and when I saw the specs on the M1 based MacBook Pro I upgraded for faster processing  My existing system has an Apple monitor wifi keyboard and mouse and a WD 3 TB external driveThe two USBC ports on the new MacBook Pro are inadequate  I also bought a new 27 LG monitor because I couldnt figure out how to use the old monitor with the new computer  The LG monitor has 4 USBC ports on the back so I assumed would give me enough connections for my devices  WRONGOnly one of the LG ports is Lighting compatible so I had to use it to connect and power the laptop  I had to buy a USBC to Displayport adapter plus a Displayport to Firewire adapter to connect my external drive but this wasnt supported over the monitors USBC ports it had to be connected to the remaining Lightening port on the laptop  This consumed all the easily accessible portsThen I had to buy a USBC to USB3 adapter to connect my camera and other devices to the computer  All behind the monitor  Its a royal pain  Ive got it working but Im unhappy with the cludge  I dont understand why Apple put together such a capable laptop with so limited connection capabilities  Im going to be dg with this terrible configuration for yearsOn the positive side their claims of faster processing are true  I can put together a church video then export it to a file in 12 the time as my old laptop  Even the upload speeds to YouTube seem to be faster,0.063,0.073,0.864,-0.4216,Negative

Owned a 2016 MacBook Air that had display issues from the getgo but Apple said it might be okay if I was super careful handling it  I couldnt go without a laptop for 2 weeks so decided to risk it  After a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump and after the warranty period of course  Used it hooked up to the TV only for about a year but as that was difficult in itself overheating prevented sleep function etc had to change course  Didnt wanna pay 550 for a new display so bought the M1 2020 MacBook Air instead Seemed to be operating well until 8 months in when I wasnt even anywhere near it and the display went totally out  Wouldnt turn on after repeated powering down so called Apple  They had me power on with that shiftcontrol for 10 secs and it went on again However considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to AppleThey ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasnt working  Thats what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places in case you like I didnt really know what it did  Had never dropped this or mishandled it in any waySent in my laptop for repair and its now been more than a week without and theyre still diagnosing it  Luckily my old laptop is still semifunctional if I hook it up to my TV  And I still had a few months left in the warranty  But what if it didnt and I didnt have the old one still functionalTwo times in a row MacBook Air with serious display issues in the last 5 yrs with no accidental damage from me Aside from this has superior speed and processing power doesnt overheat but still takes 2030 sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the 2012 I used to haveIf you buy an Apple laptop now Apple care plus is almost mandatory  Will have to seriously consider going back to Windows for my next laptop,0.123,0.072,0.805,0.9653,Positive
I gave my wife this new MacBook Air as a gift 3 months ago She is very careful with it She opens it last night and the screen is garbled Theres a hairline crack in it leading from the left edge It wasnt dropped It wasnt pressed on sat on or kept under books In other words it was NORMAL use when the damn thing stopped workingWe took it to Apple store and they want 400 to fix it Its 3 months old The guy says the display is flimsy and subject to crack I go online to see if he is telling the truth found a LOT of hits of others complaining about how easily the screen cracksIm a big Apple fan but am disappointed and outraged that Apple would sell a product with such a design flaw and expect users to buy Apple Care so that they pay less when it breaks even under NORMAL useSave your money buy and older model or get an iPad which ironically can take a beating by a 12 year old gamer without fail,0.092,0.102,0.806,-0.609,Negative
I am one of the thousands that have come back to their laptop the next day only to find black vertical lines  This has happened twice I bought the computer in August 2021   Apple fixed the screen the first time but are now asking for 514 dollars claiming that I damanged the screen  I did not  This problem is so common there are two class action lawsuits that have been filed against Apple  They purposely sold a computer that they knew would develop cracks with opening or closing it,0.033,0.022,0.945,0.2469,Positive
Apple USED to make great computers Past tense Ive used them for many almost 20 years but recently bought this computer in December and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed How the mighty have fallenI was always the biggest Apple supporter I have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself From the Apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros macbook airs and phones I defended them against the Apple haters and always had their backs I thought I was going to be Apple for life I even own many shares of their stock which I will be dumping soon because I see the writing on the wall I could tell something was up with them as Apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesnt move Its the biggest slug of a stock I now think I have stumbled upon the reason whyIf you google the recent complaints about Apple you will see Apple does not have the great customer service they once had I was mistaken to think they did They have also started cheaping out big time The result Products that dont last Couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and Im sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here Selling all of my AAPL stock ASAP statWarning do not buy this computer Apples quality has gone wayyy downhillThe MacBook Air cords are absolutely horrendous I am on my third Apple cord in less than 6 months I brought the product to an Apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me He told me I must be doing something wrong Nothing has changed about my usage of their products Ive always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old Think years and years Not months So youd think if I was the problem like this guy tried to say I was Id be going through computer cords right and left right Well I havent And looking up my account would prove that However Apple doesnt care They want to charge me for to replace their defective products anywayWelcome to the new Apple where the customer is always WRONGThen the guy doubled down and told me that hed been working at the Apple store for 10 years and Im the ONLY person who has ever had a problem with their cord A simple google search has proved that to be completely false Everybody complains about the quality of their cords This must be huge business for them selling cords like thisSo the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong If you want to sign on for that good luck I hope you never run into a problem and see what Im talking about but youll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time I am DONE I work too hard for my money and they arent the only computer show on the road Lucky for me I speak PC tooThanks for nothing Apple Good job burning that bridge You just lost a loyal customer over 19 Hope it was worth the extra  Its not the money Apple Its the principle I wont do business with companies who treat me like that period Peace out,0.11,0.132,0.757,-0.9246,Negative
The M1 chip really is amazing But it only lasted five days for me Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub The screen wouldnt turn on at all and an Apple repair tech couldnt figure it out after doing a few quick tests Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one,0.094,0.0,0.906,0.726,Positive

It amazes me how much praise Apple seems to be getting for an out dated design and user interface  Where is the touch interface and pen input especially since it is supposed to run IPad apps  Where is the flexibility of a 2 in 1 that we have had available for years  Apple has basically given us a fast dinosaur with a pretty face,0.184,0.0,0.816,0.9081,Positive
Overall I love it However with that said there are some serious cons to consider before purchasing1 Terrible camerasuper grainy This is unfortunate for a time that the majority of us are working at home or are reliant on FT for communication2 Its important to be mindful and as most techs will admit this is easily apples worst M chipit will only get better In the meantime however this Mac is super fastI use it for school work and casual browsing If thats what youre looking for I recommend it If youre looking for the best of the best wait until they fix this camera,0.244,0.089,0.667,0.9582,Positive
Headsup this review will be lengthy but I wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choiceThe MacBook Air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight slim design and good battery life One caveat that has always plagued the MacBook Air of years past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked lowerpowered processors which were always reserved for the Pro line That was why I always got a MacBook Pro in years past This time around when Apple announced the new M1 chip I was curious so I watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new Air the Air has the same chipset as the MacBook Pro with the same GHz at 32 while saving 300 I am on a budget but I also didnt want to sacrifice performance so I was a little nervous I was missing out by not getting the Pro but thankfully I have not had to sacrifice a thingI am a fulltime digital design student so my workflow can be demanding at times with running Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign etc I previously purchased a 2017 MacBook Pro and it was my daily driver until about midMarch when I made a grievous error and went out and purchased a Lenovo Yoga C940 with 16GB of Ram Intel i7 Processor at a whopping price tag of 150000 Buyers remorse soon followed as the Yoga was plagued with overheating issues thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life The only thing that I liked was the speaker setup and the 4K touch screen Other than that I was beyond disappointed I sent it back and went back to using my 2017 MacBook Pro until I purchased this AirSo the prosFantastic battery lifeI have a tough time killing the battery on this computer It will easily last an entire day and even longer if you arent totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like I do Its great to know you dont have to always carry a charger with you everywhere you can carry from class to class the coffee shop and back home and itll still have battery to spare A win in my bookHeat management and fanless designI am super nitpicky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops which is why I always love the MacBooks and detest Windows hence sending the Lenovo back  The fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind I dont have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it or annoying fans kicking on I also like that I dont have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills since there is no fan I can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry Im blocking a fan exhaust  Again another win in my bookSlim designat 28 pounds and having a tapered design you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like youre lugging around a brick I also liked the tapered design as its a little more ergonomic than my MacBook Pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad Its a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the timeKeyboardgone are the butterfly mechanisms of MacBooks past One thing I really missed when I gave up my 2015 MacBook Pro was the keyboard Thankfully with the new Air and Pros you get the scissor switch mechanisms back so my fingers dont feel like theyre hitting bottom when typing for long periods of timeTrackpadI love love the force touch trackpad I still believe Apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there Hands down Its smooth as butterPerformanceThis is the little machine that could It puts my 2017 Pro to shame It also outperforms the Lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line at a fraction of the cost I can have multiple tabs in Safari open Photoshop Apple Music Microsoft Word and this doesnt even break a sweat I also like that I can do some light video editing on this For most peopleespecially college studentsthis computers power should be more than sufficient Keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer you might want to opt for the Pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling Again thats if youre editing like multiple 4K videos on a daily basis but for college students or the average Joe that may only need to do the occasional video projectno problem This computer can handle itScreenIts nice and bright and the color accuracy is on point which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like I doSpeakersI am a music junkie and I have to constantly have music going when Im working on school projects and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good Good stereo separation and punchy They could do with a little more bass and when you max the volume it can get a little faded but thats to be expected for such small speaker drivers I am more than pleased with them They also work good for bingewatching shows on NetflixThe cons there are fewThe webcamits a 720P webcam and well it looks like a 720P webcam Its a little grainy and washed out It will do in a pinch but youd think in 2020 wed get an upgrade on the webcamThe lack of portsin true Apple fashion the IO is somewhat lacking You have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports of which you cannot plug in an external GPU and are limited to one external monitor this is a limit that Apples M1 system on a chip not the thunderbolt ports which I am sure will be resolved in future iterations I would have liked to have seen at least one USBA port for legacy things like flash drives etc But thats just me being nitpickyM1 chip running Intel appsbecause Apples M1 chip runs on ARM and most apps are coded for Intel there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new Apple chip natively like Adobe Creative Cloud You might run into a few glitches and hickups while app developers are getting up to speed So far I havent really run into any issues but there is that possibility I am sure here soon it wont be a problem Again its nitpickingTo sum up this MacBook Air is a winner I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone and I would absolutely buy it again You get the performance and the portability while saving some  by not buying the Pro line I am very happy with this computer and think I might just have come as close as I can to the perfect laptop for my needsHappy

Like thousands of other people the screen started flickering after about 2 months Then it went completly black Apple store said my only option was pay over 400 to fix the screen Apple call center said they can only take a complaint and my only option is to pay the money the store said to fix their defective product Google to find out more Dont by this defective product Apple says it is not covered by its warranty because it is the customer fault But it is happening to 1000s of people and they know it is actually their fault,0.017,0.127,0.857,-0.8201,Negative
Great out of the box then slowly the battery life started decreasing the constant hard reboots to get Safari back up and running inexplicably running hot and crashing more often than a Windows machine Simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary rebootI firmly believe that Apple will eventually get the bugs will get worked out but for now look elsewhere or wait for either the M1x or M2 processors that will hopefully have this operating smoothlyUPDATE There are other emerging issuesIn Safari the keystrokes to italicize CommandI will randomly switch to opening up a new email message and the keystrokes to convert text to LaTeX commandshiftL now inexplicably opens the left panel I am also coming into the known compatibility issue mentioned elsewhere,0.045,0.023,0.932,0.6187,Positive
Bought one directly from Apple I was excited to see how nice it would be to use since I had recently moved over to using an iPhone and was impressed at how it had improved over the years All the positive reviews and videos everywhere made this seem like a great product Dont be fooled Please This is one of the most disappointing and frustrating pieces of tech Ive ever had the displeasure of getting to use Never have I seen or used a computer that had so many options that you will never need Missing options you should always have And not be capable of preforming basic tasks without bugging out To those saying this is one of the best computers youve ever used have you ever used a computer before Anytime within the last 1015 years Im willing to bet not,0.183,0.066,0.751,0.9588,Positive

This was the first Apple Laptop Ive purchased My entire life I was so excited to always purchase an Apple MacBookMacBook Air because of the positive reviews I tend to review most everything in the most positive light but this is just horrible I constantly come back to the laptop and it says Please report unexpected shutdown to Apple This has happened at least 8 times with no response from an Apple Technician Then the camera quality for a 2020 Machine is something out of the 1990s Its horrible I look grainy and I bought this laptop for an MBA program If you want to run many programs at once even with upgrade RAM and Processor you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off CONSTANTLY The fan does not shut off Sure its portable sure the build quality feels good in the hand In terms of performance spend the extra money and dont get this Im quite embarrassed I shelled out over 1k for this Do as you wish but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an Apple Laptop again,0.17,0.105,0.724,0.9213,Positive
Buyer beware Like the MacBook Pro pictured here the screen of the MacBook Air often cracks within a few weeks or months after purchase entirely without any misuse The design flaw seems to be the relative inflexibility of the screens LCD panelI ordered a MBA then returned the package unopened after reading relevant articles on 9to5mac and the discussion thread on the Apple support site With few exceptions Apple refuses to make the repair under warranty The users cost of replacing the screen amounts to half the purchase price,0.058,0.0,0.942,0.6369,Positive

What happens when you perfect a product You can only go downhill In 2015 Apple perfected the MacBook Then they ruined itEveryone in 2015 Its great A bit more battery life would be niceApple Well make it thinner make the touchpad so big people hit it with their palms remove the magnetic breakaway power cable that everyone loves replace all the ports with USBC ports so people have to buy dongles swap the keyboard for one that barely even functions and hell just to mess with everyone lets lower the battery lifeThe 2020 does little to fix any of the issues Its a crap product but after Jobs died Tim Cook couldnt make changes because hed basically be admitting he was wrong And they need to keep changing things because otherwise it is only perfect and not new  Whoever decided this was the way to go should be working in an Amazon warehouse sorting returns,0.104,0.109,0.787,-0.2023,Negative
First off Im giving this one star just so youll read this honest review I brought this Mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but Im giving 1 star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers The usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market I attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read Kept saying I need a usb30 to work So I then used the cable that came with my Samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately I spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it The cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which I guess is ok for most people But for me it was not Apple already doesnt give us headphones anymore and they dont even have the decency to give us a very good cable 1star because for this price I could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one Last apple laptop I will ever buy O and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it,0.117,0.053,0.83,0.9317,Positive

UPDATE 12152020  After three weeks Im still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air8 Core CPU8 Core GPU512 SSD8GB RAM  My updated plea MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY  STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEEDRemember Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years Not that long ago 80 GB hard drives were HUGE and UPGRADABLE RAM was upgradable The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradableThe one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once Ive caught myself with 50 Safari open in one browser and 39 Chrome in another while running AffinityFinal Cut Pro  and YES the dreaded Beach Ball has reared its ugly head Well this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how longStorage can be added with external drives slower but it will let you scrape by RAM is another story When you constantly use up RAM the system starts using swap memory where it uses the SSD to store temporary files One of the YouTube reviewers Created Labs explains it like this RAM memory is like writing on a white board its made to be temporary Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil It can be erased but if its written on and erased for too long its going to degrade the medium It will take years for this to cause problems but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks none of the parts are replaceable The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the boardAs ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is when its not upgradable get the maximum in this case 16 GBI really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete except for possibly the very high end Pro modelsThere is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing a M1 with a fan will be helpful Upgrading to the cheaper 699Upgrades M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps but I need a laptop so So that is why Im planning to return this machine and get one likely the MacBook Pro M1 with 16 GB RAM  1 TB SSDA note on browsers Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1 at least for now I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome where it did not save most of the imagestext on the page In Safari its worked perfectlyI purchased the MacBook Air M1 8 core GPU and 8 core CPU model with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store 11202020 with education pricing I traded in my MNYH2LLA  2017 12 Macbook with the Intel M3 processor 256 GB SSD 8 GB Ram I kept my charging adapter  Ccable which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air so ended up with a 330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open including Final Cut  Logic Pro Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single Cport fiascoI likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space so I paid more by going with eh 8 core From everything that Ive seen the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive Pro Apps running at the same timeI would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook so this has been an amazing upgrade for meI would say that the bottom line is that if youre someone who only uses a laptop for office  basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball not responding issues or if you have nonApple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1 If however you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable faster and cooler running than the Intel models its a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any nonupgradable Mac,0.08,0.052,0.868,0.9762,Positive

This is a great desktop I have it paired with a Dell hi res display I purchased with my old Mac My old Mac was getting unreliable 2015 This air is very similar to the Mac but faster reliable I like the larger touch pad and dont have to use a wireless mouse I have a USB type C HUB to get more connectivity Keyboard is great,0.172,0.0,0.828,0.9091,Positive
I decided to treat myself this year to this Ordered it on the Apple website and was told 12 weeks I ordered it on Amazon and it was here in 2 days for the same price Love this As for the product  you can not go wrong with Apple I was a little shook by the price but its worth every penny,0.16,0.017,0.823,0.7829,Positive

IntroAs a college student having a reliable and portable workstation is extremely valuable The New MacBook Air powered by the M1 chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by Apple Although it looks just like the previous models the M1 chip delivers insanely great performanceDesign and buildSince its inception Macbook Airs design and build were one of its core selling points and the Macbook Air M1 is no exception It has that Signature Aluminium body that youll see with the other Macbook Variants The laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your moneys worth You can easily open this laptop with only one finger this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple One of the things that the original Macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display gone are the days of a 720p panel And brought is a beautiful P3 Wide color gamut 25601440p panel The overall viewing experience is awesome The bezels are the same size as last years model which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released but its not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience The updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing Im yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that I like better than the ones made by apple The dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound however there is some slight distortion at high volumesStorageStorage is also very important as a college student As youre going to need some space to store all your documents files and Zoom Lectures The MacBook Air comes with up to 2TB of SSD storage This specific model I have only had 128GB of storage which honestly should be fine for most students and if you dont want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external SSD or hard drive This will cost you way less than what Apple offersPortabilityAs a College student in 2021 because of Covid its been kinda different Very small pauseall of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform So if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting then portability starts to matter The MacBook Air weighs in at 275 pounds and is 156mm thick This laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference This is important to a lot of students especially if you have backtoback classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over 46 pounds This Laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wonderingReliability and BatteryThe Apple MacBook Air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade The Macbook Air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this because of its insanely reliable performance for its price but lets talk about the chip thats made all this possibleThe biggest change this year is no doubt the M1 chip the ARMbased chip is fast  like stupid fast Applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable Not only can it easily fly through daytoday tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers but it can also handle intensive tasks such as 4K video editing in fact I managed to edit an entire 4K video on the M1 MacBook air and the performance  exporting times were very impressive Anyway that was sometimes impossible on the previousgens of Macbook air Now if you are considering this device for video editing then I would highly recommend the 16 Gig variantThe next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life I think this is the best battery life I have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor The laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing browsing and streaming content I can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videosConclusionOverall theres a quote that says Speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction Mahatma Gandhi The Macbook Air M1 has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire Its Portability reliability and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody whos always on the go and Im personally really excited for the direction that Apple is heading towards with their new M lineup of processers,0.154,0.043,0.803,0.9985,Positive

No problems with the mac air Easy to transition from my old 2104 MacBook Pro I also bought an external HD which was cheaper than upgrading from old 256 to 512 My warning is about Office 2019 There was stuff on the web that 2016 would not work needed 64bit but while there seemed to be workarounds I just upgraded and bought 2019 There is a scam site posing as Microsoft Officesetup that looks legit once on it but you get an error message and phone number to resolve After half an hour he explains that it is the firewall and can fix it by downloading one costing only hundreds of dollars The url isnt Microsoft but rest looks like it While I didnt fall for it it is preying on the few who might So thought I would mention it The mac is good and worth upgrading especially if as with mine hardware faults are developing in old one,0.092,0.101,0.807,-0.3919,Negative

This is a phenomenal laptop and not just at its price point The M1 chip is snappy and fast the battery life is amazing and the screen quality is excellent All of that is bundled in a thin light and quiet fanless form factor Id highly recommend this MacBook Air unless you want to run high intensity games they just arent native to Mac OS and wont run as well as they will on Windows,0.142,0.022,0.835,0.8683,Positive
Im new to the Mac world at least since the early days in the 80s So far it has been a pleasant experience and I like the stock software and layout I havent really had to purchase any additional apps to be able to do the things that Ive become accustomed to on PCs so there is a nice learning curve I do have a couple of constructive criticisms that are not specific to the MacBook Air though In the future Id like to see touchscreens included on their laptop models being a former teacher of persons with autism they really benefit from the additional input method Also the Retina display is awesome but maybe in some of their higher priced laptops like the MacBook Pro they can start using OLEDs as model upgrades Other than that Im a fully satisfied Mac devotee now though I still love my PCs,0.183,0.009,0.808,0.9797,Positive

First lets start with the overall look of the MacBook Air its thin sleek and super light  I got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver  gold But after receiving my gold Mac Im so happy I went with it The color looks so much BETTER in person it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it it looks goldI use my Mac for some web searching emails  when I do so the battery does good and if Im doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster I spent all day on it and it does not get hot so thats a plus I dont feel like I have to give it a breakI got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there  if neededNow the camera its terrible LOL but that doesnt bother me much because I wont be using or doing any zoom calls But i wish apple would make it better since its not a cheap lap topI also came from not having a lap top So far is perfect for me and what I use it for I love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails txt  calendar etcI also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen,0.214,0.038,0.748,0.9951,Positive

After years of using nothing but PC laptops the M1 chip compelled me to try Macs And let me tell you the hype is justified The new silicon MacBooks are simply incredible The ARMbased silicon chip is so amazing that I was able to forgive the laptop for its downsides which are the 720p webcam lack of SD card slot and not being able to upgrade RAM or SSD Despite these drawbacks the battery life is insane and the machine is completely silent because no fan is needed since the laptop is so heatefficient Youre also getting a powerful laptop that outperforms the vast majority of Windows laptops in the market To top it off you get a touchpad that puts other laptops to shame a beautiful aluminum design and build quality that will last Well done Apple,0.188,0.083,0.729,0.9539,Positive

First time Macbook owner Really happy with the MacBook Air Dont let the lack of a fan be offputting The only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in iMovie Even then its by no means hot to the touch This is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare I say ever The lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts The soldered in m2 storage and committing to your RAM choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint So far Im not finding 8gb of RAM to be an issue Most of the programs for Mac OS are pretty well optimized for the M1 chip So Everything feels to work pretty smoothly The battery life is next level Over all its more powerful cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever If you have been wanting to get your first MacBook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade This would not be a bad choice,0.165,0.052,0.783,0.9626,Positive
This is the bargain deal of the Apple lineup at the moment The M1 chip gives it crazy power management which equates to ridiculously long battery life incredibly low temperature operation which needs no fan so also absolute silence All this while running circles around the competitors offerings which dont stand a chance of keeping up with this incredible product With their M1 chip Apple has not just revolutionized the capabilities of a laptop but turned the whole computer industry upside down And yes it is extremely well made out of a solid chunk of aluminum is very light and has a world class screen and a redesigned keyboard that feels wonderful Incase you couldnt tell I like and recommend this laptop,0.149,0.08,0.771,0.9034,Positive

I love my MacBook But it was delivered by a over packed uhaul and left in its side out side without knocking to let me know it was thereto sign for it not any safeguards in place I am grateful for the thoughtful packing on your part because it was shipped in an oversized box and no extra packing it moved freely within the box,0.184,0.071,0.745,0.8589,Positive
I was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 Windows laptop and tablet The 2020 MacBook Air M1 screen is sharp the M1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses  This laptop is fanless and gets very warmhot only when constantly exporting very large 5Gb files  otherwise it runs cool to cold I edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly The 8Gb ram256 Gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive The Mac OS memory management allows 8Gb to be more than enough for my projects The M1 cpu performance and battery life for the MacBook Air M1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 Windows laptop and tablet My photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my Windows devices Also the MacBook Air M1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my Windows devices This laptop is a fantastic entrylevel device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the Pro models for the largermore vibrant screen richer audio cooling fans additional usbc ports sd card slot dual monitor capability and more ramssd options I purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value I would suggest most users get the 512Gb or larger internal ssd so you wont need an external ssd for videomusic storage I currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256Gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue The only possible drawbacks for the MacBook Air are there are only 2 usbc datacharging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options or use older usb accessories there is no sd card slot and software apps are still being updated for the M1 cpu I run Microsoft Office 365 on my MacBook Air I notice that Office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded Office 365 runs as fast as it does on Windows  I dont use this laptop for gaming video editing or to connect multiple monitors so I cant comment on those uses I was not expecting this level of performance from an entrylevel device Dont get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the MacBook Pro models for heavy work loads or professional use  it doesnt have the heat distribution fans to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming For most users just use and enjoy your 2020 MacBook Air M1,0.074,0.01,0.916,0.981,Positive

My first day Ive used MacBooks since 2006 when the first Intel processors were used The M1 chip is amazing I now understand why 8 Gb of RAM is perfect for this model Crystal clear text rendering Silkysmooth touch pad Nice tactile response on keyboard big improvement over the troublesome keyboards of the last 7 years Speakers are lovely Very pleased Battery fully charged Was able to easily migrate from my old 2016 MacBook Retina 12 Easy to connect with iCloud and Mac account A couple of my nonApple apps required Rosetta to run with M1 processorsmooth download of Rosetta Anyone needing a high end camera might go for the MacBook Pro but this is fine for my needs,0.164,0.029,0.806,0.9201,Positive

The device is silent because it has no fans the screen isnt Oled but it looks incredible for watching movies with vibrant colors and is very sharp making it great for text documents with small fonts The battery life is incredibly good I can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device It has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise and if you dont use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop It runs mac OS which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use If you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice,0.205,0.037,0.759,0.9909,Positive

As a long time windows user I used to not really want an apple laptop at all As I suppose apple item were so interior and always so heavy compared to premium line windows machine However I will admit in USA apple give you the best choice all around It is just lovely indeed it is about 50 heavier than the old I gave to my girl friend one year ago But most others are just admirable I list four points here1 The BEST touchpad Support all gestures most rookies have no idea how to use quick way but they know well about touchpad it is far more intuitive and easier to learn And it is smooth and nice to touch Big enough to put the whole palm upon it2 Cheap It only costs me 949 and I will say it is just a bargain It cost about 13 compared to the Fujitsu laptop of mine or about the half price I got for her last year Almost all premium windows machine on the same class cost more than Mac Even if we consider MBP14in it is still way cheaper than those Nippon machines and not a dime less than those laptops Besides apple have the best residual value after 18month usage You can get more than 60 in an used market3 Super super marvelous battery life I thought 50Wh not a big deal but it actually outlast my 73Wh Panasonic CFSV1 which cost more than 4times of this machine and provide even more juice than the Intel core Lol4 It is very good to use with other apple items As I basically buy a bunch of apple items for my girlfriend as she need some good items to help with life but google cannot provided Therefore I took a look on apple Airpod pro connect to ipad pro sharing same song Switch player to Mac or switch back to ipad iphone All so smooth One apple item is good a bunch of apple is affordable and stunning As a long time Sonyer I envy apple fans as I can never afford a whole SONY system facepalmOnly one two drawbacks1 The screen quality is not a top notch any more it is a good panel in less than 1000 but it is not belong to the premium line2 The weight is really over exaggerated 1296grams really too heavy these daysAll in all just buy it for good once Amazon restock it Actually I bought another one for myself as I want to try apple once maybe I will switch to apple also as it saves tons of moneyI highly recommend it,0.201,0.026,0.774,0.9983,Positive

I recently bought a MacBook Air after my 2011 iMac had to be retired I saw reviews about the new M1 processer in the new mac line up so out of curiosity I had to try it out for myself and I have been a fan of Arm processors for many years It has exceeded my expectations and then some when it comes to programming audio some gaming and everyday computing This is an excellent machine and the craftsmanship that went into it and its overall design is second to none This the fastest mac I have owned I have been an apple user since 1984 It deserves an extra star TY Amazon,0.098,0.0,0.902,0.876,Positive

After almost 10years with a MacBook Air I thought it was time to upgrade to the latest model  I loved the previous one  So far though  not in love  Although I do find it nice and fast and like the features there have been issues with the trackpad right out of the box  A quick look at some forums to try to resolve the problem indicated that this is a known issue for Apple so Im considering returning it before it becomes a hassle to fix  For the price of a Mac and the length of time the model has been on the market I feel like something right out of the box should work like a dream and Im not wild about spending a lot of time on fixes or workarounds  Also thunderbolt port is great and all but since the rest of the world still uses USBs could they not have just added one port to alleviate the need to purchase an adaptor as well  Disappointed Apple,0.105,0.048,0.847,0.711,Positive

I can truly say something is actually next level,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
These laptops have been next level,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So these are the new 14 inch and 16 inch 2021 MacBook Pros,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And theyre incredible for a number of reasons,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
Now at the end of the day,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyre just tools used to get a job done,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And the fact is everyone has a slightly different thing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that they want to get done,0.206,0.0,0.794,0.0772,Positive
For me its making these videos,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So well get to that in a second,0.285,0.0,0.715,0.3384,Positive
but man they have made a big jump both on the inside,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the outside of these laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So lets start on the outside,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So these laptops have a new topnotch design,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it still looks like a MacBook Pro,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
but I like pretty much all of the changes theyve made,0.486,0.0,0.514,0.8201,Positive
So the whole shape is squared off a bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and it resembles those old aluminum Powerbooks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just more modernized,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And just aesthetically you can see theyve made,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these laptops thicker like noticeably thicker,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
and that is totally fine with me,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2716,Positive
And it has plenty of benefits,0.342,0.0,0.658,0.3818,Positive
and it also stands up a little bit higher,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on those taller feet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which seemingly gives it a bit more room for those back,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and side vents for better ventilation,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
Although Ive never heard the fans spin up audibly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on these laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The Apple logo on the back slightly larger,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And theres a little engraving at the bottom now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
where they carved in the MacBook Pro text,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Thats kind of nice but functionally,0.26,0.0,0.74,0.191,Positive
as youve probably noticed yeah theres ports now,0.239,0.0,0.761,0.296,Positive
There are real ports and this really shouldnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
be a big deal but this is one of the few things,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that Apple has actually walked back from the last few years,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of MacBook Pros that havent had these ports,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So while it feels like kind of silly to celebrate them,0.477,0.0,0.523,0.743,Positive
I am happy that theyre back,0.481,0.0,0.519,0.5719,Positive
So on the right side thats a fullsized HDMI port,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
welcome back,0.75,0.0,0.25,0.4588,Positive
And you have one of the Thunderbolt 4 ports,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and a fullsize halfdepth SD card slot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
This is beautiful,0.661,0.0,0.339,0.5994,Positive
I use an SD card for audio,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
every time I make a video,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I use em all the time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and its been a long time since I just plugged,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
an SD card straight into a computer,0.275,0.0,0.725,0.2263,Positive
So this is fun,0.543,0.0,0.457,0.552,Positive
Then around the left side,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you have two more Thunderbolt 4 ports,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a headphone jack and the magnetic MagSafe charging port,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
has made its return,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So okay a couple of thoughts on this port selection,0.215,0.0,0.785,0.2944,Positive
First of all MagSafe has made its return,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but its different,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Ive never used a MagSafe machine fulltime in the past,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but this is a newer thinner and actually stronger MagSafe,0.298,0.0,0.702,0.5267,Positive
Its got a lot more lateral strength that it takes,0.303,0.0,0.697,0.539,Positive
to pull it out of the machine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So the second theres any angle on it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it snaps out much easier,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.4215,Positive
but still feels pretty MagSafe to me,0.417,0.0,0.583,0.6486,Positive
definitely safer than just if USBC was plugged straight in,0.514,0.0,0.486,0.7506,Positive
And then you get this huge charging brick,0.273,0.0,0.727,0.3869,Positive
So this is the 96watt power adapter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that comes with the 14 inch MacBook Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is already an upgrade from the 67 watt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the base model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And then theres this huge rectangular 140watt,0.304,0.0,0.696,0.3869,Positive
charging brick for the 16 inch MacBook Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But it is pretty nice that the brick is separate,0.5,0.0,0.5,0.8402,Positive
from the braided USBC cable with MagSafe on the other end,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but I am not sure why the space gray laptop,0.0,0.234,0.766,-0.3491,Negative
doesnt also come with a space gray MagSafe connector,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
That would have been a nice touch,0.359,0.0,0.641,0.4215,Positive
140 Watts though that is a lot of power,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And so you can fast charge these laptops through MagSafe,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if you want to,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.0772,Positive
Its about half charge in half an hour,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is pretty convenient but even if you dont want to,0.169,0.107,0.724,0.1943,Positive
you can unplug and just plug in via USBC,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
If youre a one charger for everything kind of person,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like me itll still be about 96 Watts,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
So not as fast but still pretty good,0.576,0.0,0.424,0.8462,Positive
Now the headphone jack,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you mightve caught during Apples presentation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that they mentioned that the headphone jack,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this time would support high impedance headphones,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
What does that mean,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Well if you have to ask it probably doesnt apply to you,0.16,0.0,0.84,0.2732,Positive
but theres a whole ecosystem of headphones out there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with much higher levels of power required,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to get real volume out of them,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Theyre known as high impedance headphones,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Ive got a couple pairs here at the studio,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So normal pair of wired headphones,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just think about like your Beats or ATHM50s,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
might have 2050 Ohms impedance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The high impedance headphones can go well over a 100 Ohms,0.189,0.0,0.811,0.2732,Positive
And so they wont really sound like much,0.0,0.249,0.751,-0.3217,Negative
Theyll be very low in volume if you plug them,0.0,0.21,0.79,-0.3384,Negative
into almost anything with a headphone jack,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And so people who use these headphones will have to carry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
an external Thunderbolt deck,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just a little thing to plug in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And so if these headphone jacks are high powered enough,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in theory thats one less dongle you have to carry right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So for my audiophiles out there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the preamps here are impressive,0.452,0.0,0.548,0.5106,Positive
and there are definitely pushing out more power,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
but this isnt some incredible super clean deck,0.258,0.306,0.436,-0.1702,Negative
or anything crazy,0.0,0.545,0.455,-0.34,Negative
With these Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs for example,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which are 250 ohm headphones MacBook Pro M1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
at absolutely maxed out hundred percent volume,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sounded comfortable,0.767,0.0,0.233,0.5106,Positive
And these new MacBook Pros hit that same level,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
at about 65 volume,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So there was an improvement,0.429,0.0,0.571,0.4588,Positive
They dont sound better than the dedicated amp,0.263,0.211,0.526,0.1516,Positive
you would have to bring but in a pinch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if youve only brought one pair of headphones,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can plug them in straight,0.275,0.0,0.725,0.2263,Positive
And thats kind of neat,0.404,0.0,0.596,0.4033,Positive
which is just saving you a dongle,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And thats kind of the theme of all of these ports,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to be honest like the HDMI port is only actually HDMI 20,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.7003,Positive
not 21 I dont know why,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And its kind of annoying that such an expensive computer,0.0,0.25,0.75,-0.4576,Negative
doesnt have the latest highest end part,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but HDMI 20 still does 4K 60,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So its great for any projector or TV,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.6573,Positive
Its good in a pinch one less dongle,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
The SD card slot is XDXC,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Its only UHS2 speeds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So it doesnt support the newer faster UHS3,0.0,0.265,0.735,-0.3657,Negative
but UHS2 is still 300 megabytes per second,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Thats pretty good in a pinch one less dongle,0.504,0.0,0.496,0.7269,Positive
So its an expensive computer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I could have easily had the higher end ports,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.34,Positive
Its definitely a knock on them but like I said,0.459,0.0,0.541,0.6249,Positive
its kind of just like the convenient in a pinch type thing,0.2,0.0,0.8,0.3612,Positive
And you know what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I might as well since were talking ports,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
you know what wouldve been cool,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
EtherNet on the power brick,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Remember what they did with the M1 iMac,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
where they have like gigabit ethernet built into the brick,0.217,0.0,0.783,0.3612,Positive
I think MacBook Pro users would be more likely to want,0.148,0.0,0.852,0.144,Positive
ethernet without a dongle on the laptop like they did here,0.217,0.0,0.783,0.3612,Positive
but they didnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But anyway theres just something hilarious,0.415,0.0,0.585,0.5499,Positive
about them going backwards on the last four years,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of MacBook Pros and actually adding ports back to it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Its not something they do all the time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So Im giving a thumbs up on that,0.309,0.0,0.691,0.3976,Positive
Speaking of going backwards though no touch bar,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
So theres a new keyboard on these MacBook Pros,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and its all buttons all real physical keys,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So theyve replaced the touch bar with a full row,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
full height physical function keys at the top,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
Its really a shame the touch bar never reached,0.0,0.439,0.561,-0.5703,Negative
its full potential and Ill miss the like two times,0.18,0.317,0.504,-0.2263,Negative
I thought it was useful with audio fitting shortcuts inside,0.266,0.0,0.734,0.4404,Positive
Final Cut Pro or fastforwarding scrubbing through Instagram,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2732,Negative
videos on the desktop but these buttons really are better,0.322,0.0,0.678,0.6448,Positive
And the whole keyboard is an improvement,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4588,Positive
from previous years too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Its backlit the keys feel good and travel decently well,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.6124,Positive
like their keyboards from five years ago,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
the touch ID button in the corner works super quickly,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.5994,Positive
and reliably and its subtle,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but the whole keyboard is inset in this black,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
anodized rectangle and I love it,0.512,0.0,0.488,0.6369,Positive
Its a nice touch,0.583,0.0,0.417,0.4215,Positive
Black keys will definitely still show fingerprints,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
and a little bit of skin oils,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more than the lighter keyboards out there on other machines,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but Im willing to deal with that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The speakers absolutely incredible,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
especially on the 16 inch still the biggest fullest,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
best speakers Ive ever heard in a laptop on the bigger one,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.6369,Positive
And the studio microphones are also now improved,0.307,0.0,0.693,0.4767,Positive
but that brings us to the front of this laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So lets talk about the front,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So these new displays are on paper and in real life,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty incredible,0.762,0.0,0.238,0.4939,Positive
They are 10 bit panels,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Theyre mini LED HDR 16 x 10,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost 4K high refresh rate displays,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I mean its just all of the boxes checked,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then theres the notch up top,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2023,Positive
Okay so the screens are amazing,0.588,0.0,0.412,0.6908,Positive
Its basically a mini pro display XDR,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but with even higher pixel density and higher refresh rate,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I mean it doesnt look that different,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
from previous MacBook Pros,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Most of the time youre using it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but it does hit that 1600nits max brightness while watching,0.274,0.0,0.726,0.5267,Positive
HDR content which is awesome,0.506,0.0,0.494,0.6249,Positive
And the thinner bezels all the way around,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were long overdue and underneath the menu bar,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im also happy that it is still,0.381,0.0,0.619,0.5719,Positive
its the taller 16 x 10 aspect ratio,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And then ProMotion is interesting,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
So we know this as the adaptive refresh rate,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Its not always maxing out here at 120 Hertz,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
even when flying around the UI,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Max were already decently smooth at 60,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but I can tell this is not going to 120 Hertz all the time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So like scrolling in Safari for example,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive
Apparently Safari still needs an update,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to support the highest of this adaptive frame rate,0.252,0.0,0.748,0.4019,Positive
But there are a couple areas where you really notice,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a higher refresh rate,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I mean moving your mouse around a lot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
moving a lot of bigger animations,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like swiping between spaces and other big flowy stuff,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
like the genie animation for minimizing that stuff,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
I mean its awesome,0.672,0.0,0.328,0.6249,Positive
Moving around a Final Cut timeline,0.0,0.344,0.656,-0.2732,Negative
Thats very smooth too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Thats where the higher frame rate is noticeable,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the extra smoothness is appreciated,0.398,0.0,0.602,0.5106,Positive
So this isnt the first mini LED display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
This isnt the first HDR laptop ever,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Its definitely not the first high refresh rate screen,0.252,0.0,0.748,0.4019,Positive
in a laptop but just combining all of these things,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the 10bit display the thinner bezels all of it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it is a great display,0.577,0.0,0.423,0.6249,Positive
So lets talk about the top notch design shall we,0.167,0.0,0.833,0.2023,Positive
Theres only a few things up here in the notch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Its the new 1080P webcam,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which looks perfectly decent now,0.512,0.0,0.488,0.6369,Positive
thanks for catching up Apple,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
And theres a little ambient light sensor,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and a little LED light and thats pretty much it,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4939,Positive
Theres no way the notch needed to be this big,0.0,0.196,0.804,-0.296,Negative
for that hardware,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I mean Ill wait for the iFixit teardown,0.0,0.318,0.682,-0.4215,Negative
but theres no way you needed this much space,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.4215,Negative
So its an odd choice,0.0,0.391,0.609,-0.3744,Negative
And its really easy to complain about this,0.267,0.231,0.502,0.1102,Positive
when youre not actually using the laptop but two things,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
One I think Apple is actually finding this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to be like a part of their design language now,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
Like this is a recognizable laptop silhouette,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
because of the notch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
However we feel about that it is what it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but then also turns out its okay to put a notch right here,0.176,0.0,0.824,0.3291,Positive
in the part of the screen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that you really dont notice very much,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when youre actually using a laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The mouse goes underneath it for those who are wondering,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the software seems to basically treat,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
the screen like there is no notch,0.258,0.227,0.515,0.0772,Positive
Like if you take a screenshot or do a screen recording,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
its still drawing the display there with all of its pixels,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And anytime you go full screen with anything,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it just turns the entire menu bar black,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And it looks like the bezel at the top basically,0.35,0.0,0.65,0.5106,Positive
gets slightly thicker and its very deep black,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with the mini LED,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The notch literally never cuts into any content,0.212,0.0,0.788,0.2235,Positive
Basically think of it as cutting into the extra display,0.0,0.143,0.857,-0.128,Negative
that you actually didnt have before,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And theyve just shoved the menu bar up there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
into that extra display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
You know there are some weird quirks when you have an app,0.0,0.134,0.866,-0.1779,Negative
with enough menu bar items,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it runs those things right underneath the notch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and things clearly to be patched up with a software update,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.4019,Positive
maybe making them scrollable or like adding,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
an expansion button or something like that,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
So at this point its like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
oh people are making the custom apps,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to totally black out the top part of the display,0.167,0.0,0.833,0.2023,Positive
to hide the notch which I mean,0.0,0.254,0.746,-0.1779,Negative
if you hate it that much sure you have that option,0.153,0.247,0.6,-0.34,Negative
But like I promise you when you actually start using,0.47,0.0,0.53,0.7351,Positive
the laptop and youre in apps and things full screen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it never cuts anything off,0.321,0.0,0.679,0.2235,Positive
Like youre paying attention to whats on the screen,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
It disappears even more than it did,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.34,Negative
on the smaller screen of the phones,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But that being said if the next version of this laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
still has a notch this big and doesnt add face ID,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Ill wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus,0.203,0.228,0.569,-0.0772,Negative
They gotta be planning on putting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it there eventually right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
It almost feels useless to talk about how it feels,0.0,0.219,0.781,-0.3657,Negative
just spinning around Mac OS Monterrey,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because of course its fine,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.2023,Positive
Like I got the improved notification management,0.583,0.0,0.417,0.6808,Positive
its got the rounded corners up top,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2023,Positive
Its got the quick mouseover at the bottom corner,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to get to Quick Notes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
We get all that those nice features,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
but were here for the performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
We want to know if its actually as great as those graphs,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.6597,Positive
Apple suggested at the Apple event,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Spoiler alert Theyre both really that good,0.518,0.0,0.482,0.6573,Positive
So Ive got a couple of different specs here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
This is the M1 Pro in the 14 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Ive also got a maxed out 16 inch that Ive been testing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So I get to the differences between M1 Max and M1 Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and all that in a second but just know that yeah,0.237,0.0,0.763,0.4215,Positive
they are very very good,0.465,0.0,0.535,0.5379,Positive
So when it comes to performance benchmarks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I feel like everyones more or less looking,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
for the perfect benchmark out there,0.425,0.0,0.575,0.5719,Positive
that will confirm to them,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that it will work best for their own workflow,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.6369,Positive
Like I said these are tools and from what Ive seen,0.217,0.0,0.783,0.3612,Positive
it feels like that benchmark result exists,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
for pretty much every use case so far for these,0.262,0.0,0.738,0.4939,Positive
So as far as synthetic benchmarks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it dropped the highest single score Geekbench CPU score,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Ive ever seen from any Mac,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And multicore lined it up right around the maxed out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
18 core iMac,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I also ran it through Cinebench,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and it had again very impressive single core scores,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.5563,Positive
and heres how the multicore stacks up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But when I say when I tell you these laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
are next level I mean that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because the real world performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the real world capabilities of these laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is dramatically better than they have any business doing,0.266,0.0,0.734,0.4404,Positive
So obviously we know about the way higher memory bandwidth,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
We know about the way higher number of GPU cores,0.126,0.0,0.874,0.0772,Positive
And I love the 10 15 25 improvements that come across,0.448,0.0,0.552,0.7579,Positive
the board with all of that stuff,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The vertical integration worked right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But there are parts of this chip that Apple has built,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with specific purposes in mind,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And for those purposes its next level,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So these laptop chips have a media engine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and theres a ProRes accelerator as part of that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
M1 Max has two of them,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Video professionals you can see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
where were going with this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Working with ProRes at all with these laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is dramatically better,0.592,0.0,0.408,0.4404,Positive
I think an example was like encoding a video with compressor,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
is 10 times as fast as it was with the Intel MacBook Pros,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Thats the next level So like I said these laptops are,0.237,0.0,0.763,0.4201,Positive
thats why they got me excited,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.34,Positive
I work with video too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So lets see how it does with Final Cut Pro,0.0,0.189,0.811,-0.2732,Negative
So as I mentioned I did edit the last video,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the entire AirPods 3 review,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the 16 inch M1 Max Mac Book Pro in various locations,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
both around the studio and at home,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
plugged in and on battery,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And it handled it incredibly well like shockingly well,0.521,0.135,0.344,0.6809,Positive
Keep in mind this is 8K REDCODE raw footage,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Its a mix of low and medium compression shots,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2732,Negative
from the VRAPTOR,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And Im able to bend the color and raw data,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and move all around the timeline and chop everything up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty quickly and seamlessly without hiccups,0.39,0.0,0.61,0.4939,Positive
just like on the desktop on the Mac Pro,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
So playback was in high quality instead of high performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So Im getting a ton of resolution and really only dropping,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a couple of frames here and there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
again just like the Mac Pro,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
One of my ways to measure if a machine is choking,0.0,0.25,0.75,-0.4588,Negative
or struggling at all is like how long the delay is,0.16,0.327,0.513,-0.3818,Negative
between pressing the play button,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.34,Positive
the space bar on unrendered footage,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And when it actually starts to play back,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.34,Positive
and this delay as you can see its like less,0.195,0.18,0.625,0.0516,Positive
than a quarter of a second,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Thats as good as Ive ever seen it in Final Cut,0.207,0.15,0.643,0.2023,Positive
So the only thing thats caused me any concern was that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a couple of times the audio waveform previews,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
took longer to load when I was pinching and zooming,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
into parts of the timeline,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And I suspect thats RAM related,0.0,0.355,0.645,-0.296,Negative
Of course M1 Max only has 64 gigs of RAM,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
versus the Mac Pro Ive edited on has 768 gigs of RAM,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So it makes sense that I saw a difference there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but when the edit was finished,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and it came time to export it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I of course just for fun copied the project,0.32,0.0,0.68,0.5106,Positive
across to multiple computers,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and just did the same export on all of them,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to see how it went,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So the M1 Pro Mac Book Pro the 14 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
exported the whole thing in 6 minutes and 40 seconds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Its pretty good,0.859,0.0,0.141,0.7269,Positive
The 50000 28core Mac Pro did the same thing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in five minutes and 42 seconds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And then the M1 Max Mac Pro or MacBook Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
did it in four minutes and six seconds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So the Mac Book Pro beat the Mac Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
handily at exporting the project,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And its not even like export times really matter,0.133,0.201,0.666,-0.182,Negative
all that much at this level,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
four minutes five minutes whatever,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But the fact that it beat the Mac Pro already is ridiculous,0.0,0.228,0.772,-0.5023,Negative
And I also did that while not plugged in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which doesnt lose any performance on battery,0.273,0.0,0.727,0.3089,Positive
And the battery dropped 2 from 96 to 94 while exporting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So you mightve heard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres different performance profiles,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And this is true on the 16 inch MacBook Pro,0.237,0.0,0.763,0.4215,Positive
was interesting playing with these,0.6,0.0,0.4,0.5423,Positive
Most of the time I just left it on automatic,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because it would just do its thing no hiccups at all,0.0,0.18,0.82,-0.296,Negative
and I could edit fine,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.2023,Positive
But when I went to go export just for fun,0.357,0.0,0.643,0.6652,Positive
I turned on the 16 inches high power mode,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which in theory should let the chips run full throttle,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
more often spin up the fans a little bit more et cetera,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I still never heard the fans ever,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but the export time was even faster,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
three minutes and 49 seconds Jesus,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And on top of all of that,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2023,Positive
the plugin suite that I use Motion VFX,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is updating steadily all their stuff,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to support Apple Silicon which is great,0.576,0.0,0.424,0.7783,Positive
At this point honestly I think its a no brainer,0.268,0.196,0.536,0.2023,Positive
The Travel iMac is now retired,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I can safely edit everything on a laptop,0.39,0.0,0.61,0.4939,Positive
but Final Cut Pro is just one use case,0.0,0.249,0.751,-0.3919,Negative
Theres plenty of other stuff,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
If you watch The Verges review,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they did a lot of Adobe stuff and you can check out their,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
incredible findings with the newest version,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of After Effects really finally taking advantage,0.274,0.0,0.726,0.3102,Positive
of multithreaded GPU rendering,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
They also showed it outperforming the mobile RTX 3080,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when editing in Premiere,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And there are some glowing reviews for music producers,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and sound designers who love having a whisper,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
silent computer that can also process way more audio effects,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and that they can take with them,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And Tyler Stalman did a great video,0.451,0.0,0.549,0.6249,Positive
reviewing the laptop for photographers,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
where the M1 Maxs laptop is importing and generating,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
previews et cetera twice as fast as a 2018 MacBook Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And he also opens up every single app at once,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and streams a bunch of ProRes videos all simultaneously,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
next to each other and you guessed it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
It doesnt even blink,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And then theres also a great tweet,0.451,0.0,0.549,0.6249,Positive
from a staff engineer at Reddit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The machine is cutting build times for their Android app,0.0,0.143,0.857,-0.128,Negative
in half and a little napkin math says,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that buying a team of them a bunch of these laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
would end up saving them a lot more money than theyd spent,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Basically these experiences are of course,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all dependent on the apps you use as a professional,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and how optimized they are,0.429,0.0,0.571,0.4588,Positive
All of Apples apps are the first ones to be updated,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right out the box,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So Final cut Pro that I use is great but over time,0.193,0.128,0.68,0.217,Positive
more of them will continue to be updated,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and see those gains as well,0.529,0.0,0.471,0.5423,Positive
And I didnt even talk about battery life,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but it does all of this highperformance stuff,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
while also being incredibly efficient,0.436,0.0,0.564,0.4754,Positive
So you have the fast charging already if you want it,0.115,0.0,0.885,0.0772,Positive
But I found that the 16inch with the 100watt hour,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
battery lasts a bit longer than the 14 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with a 70watt hour battery and M1 Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
will last a bit longer than M1 Max,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
It turns out those GPU cores do run a little bit hotter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and use more power,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
But ultimately if you want the longest possible battery,0.153,0.0,0.847,0.1154,Positive
life that would be 16 inch M1 Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Nevertheless they all get around the same battery life,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Ive found as the M1 MacBook Pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is to say all day best in class,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.6369,Positive
You can still kill it in like four hours,0.176,0.331,0.493,-0.4939,Negative
if youre just sitting on battery editing video,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in high power mode the whole time then yeah,0.216,0.0,0.784,0.296,Positive
then you can crush it,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.1531,Negative
But again the fast charging turns out to be very useful,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.6474,Positive
So you know what Heres the recommendation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
If you are a professional that works on your laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and youre on an older version,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or you find yourself reaching the limits of one of these,0.153,0.0,0.847,0.2023,Positive
and youre thinking maybe you should try,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to look at one of these new MacBook Pros,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
I feel very confident saying yeah,0.665,0.0,0.335,0.7146,Positive
you could pick one up and be very very happy,0.322,0.0,0.678,0.6453,Positive
I think the real choice is between M1 Pro and M1 Max,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and 14 inch and 16 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Now for me Im going with a 16 inch M1 Max,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just because I take advantage of the extra GPU cores,0.2,0.0,0.8,0.25,Positive
And I wish I could go with the 14 inch maxed out,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.4019,Positive
which you can max out to the same exact specs,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as a 16 inch with maybe just small thermal differences,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyll perform about the same,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but I really like having the bigger screen,0.381,0.0,0.619,0.5704,Positive
for editing video,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So Im going maxed out big laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So then for M1 Pro versus M1 Max,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
M1 Max is the most powerful,0.382,0.0,0.618,0.4754,Positive
but it does nick a bit of your battery life,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
So I would upgrade only if you need those extra GPU cores,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and youll know if your app supported,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
And I wont even pretend to game on a Mac,0.156,0.0,0.844,0.0762,Positive
Some people do though,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And if you do theoretically the M1 Max,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
would also handle that better,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
But like I said from the beginning,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5023,Positive
this is a tool and it happens to be a really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really good tool at what it does,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
And it happens to be next level at a couple specific things,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that its been designed and optimized for,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4588,Positive
So theres gonna be a lot of professionals like me,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
who are really happy with these,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.6115,Positive
Theres also gonna be a lot of people,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

apple silicon this has the m1 processor,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
inside and i have to say if this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
processor is as good as apple makes it,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
sound like intel and amd should be,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
getting a little worried now apple has,0.0,0.276,0.724,-0.228,Negative
already shown on their iphones and ipads,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that they can make their hardware and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
software work fairly seamlessly and now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that they control the processor they can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pair it up with mac os and again i think,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it will be a fairly seamless experience,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
anyways we are going to unbox the new,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

color of the macbook pro so were going,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to be able to take a look at both the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
space gray and silver now if theres,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
anything youd like to see in an,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
upcoming video be sure to drop a comment,0.245,0.223,0.532,0.0516,Positive
let me know about these m1 chip laptops,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now on the box youll see the different,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
colors have different colored,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
backgrounds but also i did get the eight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gigabyte model with the space gray and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the silver model has 16 gigs of ram so i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can kind of compare those two in terms,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of ram also notice on the box the silver,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
has more of silver writing whereas a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit darker on the space gray so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lets begin with the unboxing see what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we get inside this would be the silver,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook pro a little bit chilly actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im going to set that to the side for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now lets see what else we get designed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
by apple in california these should just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
be some booklets so youll see macbook,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pro your getting started welcome guide,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.4588,Positive
some extra information and there should,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have been stickers yes there they are so,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
there are apple stickers inside might be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a different color depending on what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
model you get ill open up the other box,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.4215,Negative
and compare believe it or not inside you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
do get a charging brick and this is a 61,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
watt usbc power adapter it has an apple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
logo etched into the side it is usb type,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
c and in case youre wondering the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
prongs do pop out and also this piece,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
does detach from the adapter and finally,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your usbc to usbc cable for charging or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
data transfer this is actually two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
meters long which is just over six and a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
half feet and thats everything that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
came in the box you will get the exact,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
same stuff in the space gray model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
besides the stickers i was right so the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
stickers are actually a different color,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the ones on the right are silver and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these are the more space gray colored,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
stickers on the left all right onto the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook pro lets go ahead and take this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
plastic off the silver model i also want,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
to make a note that this silver model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
has a two terabyte ssd,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
inside whereas the space gray model that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i got only has 512 gigs so the the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
silver model is definitely the highest,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
end macbook pro you can get with the m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
chip right now and dont worry you can,0.256,0.0,0.744,0.3412,Positive
get the same config in the space grey i,0.146,0.0,0.854,0.0516,Positive
just happen to choose it on the silver,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
model so here is a look a sidebyside,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
look at the two different colors pretty,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
classic color choices from apple lets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
take a close look so on the left side is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
where the two usbc slots are it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thunderbolt usb 4 connection and then,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
moving along this is the 133 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
model by the way theres a look at the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
front with a slot for your finger to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
open it up and on the right side is only,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a headphone jack you would have liked to,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
have seen more usbc ports just a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit of a bummer in my opinion on the,0.0,0.271,0.729,-0.3818,Negative
back you will see there is some,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ventilation and just a comparison of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bottom there are these black grips in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all four corners another quick,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference in the colors thats a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit harder to notice is that the apple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
logo is a little bit darker tinted,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the space gray whereas the silver,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seems like a straight up mirror and a,0.524,0.0,0.476,0.5267,Positive
little bit more of a tint to the space,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gray logo all right lets open up the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop with the onehanded test passed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with ease so you can easily open it up,0.425,0.0,0.575,0.6326,Positive
and theres that classic apple sound,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lets lets hear that again on the space,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gray,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so we are on the startup screen im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gonna run through the setup process and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
only talk about anything thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
noteworthy it does prompt you for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
accessibility settings id recommend,0.455,0.0,0.545,0.3612,Positive
going through all of them in case,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres some that youd like to turn on,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
maybe you want to turn on some closed,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
captions uh under cognitive you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
change it from light to dark mode or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

actually like so i switched it over to,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
auto you can have speak selection typing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feedback hover text theres a lot of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great accessibility options in here you,0.451,0.0,0.549,0.6249,Positive
do have the option to transfer info from,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a mac time machine backup startup disk,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or a windows pc were going to set up as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fresh for now next to the touch bar up,0.223,0.0,0.777,0.3182,Positive
at the top is your power button which,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
also couples as a fingerprint scanner,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for touch id so to set that up just set,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your finger down lift it on up and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
continue through,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
capture some of the edges of your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fingerprint from my experience this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fingerprint scanner is very fast,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
accurate it gives you an example of what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the display looks like without true tone,0.254,0.237,0.509,0.0433,Neutral
display which i prefer to have off i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wish i could just turn it off right now,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
but i have to actually go into system,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
preferences once i skip through the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
setup process to turn it off and we are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all the way through the startup process,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on our home screen this is mac os big,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sur with their very colorful bubbly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
icons lets go into about this mac there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is big sur youll notice it says apple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1 and 16 gigabytes of ram then if we go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
over to storage there is two terabytes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so out of the box,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
197 terabytes available out of the two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in display settings this has a 133 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
by,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
1600 retina display now this is my first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
time actually seeing big sur i havent,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
updated any of my macs to it just yet so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im pretty excited to actually dive into,0.528,0.0,0.472,0.6808,Positive
this os,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now lets go ahead and actually maybe,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
run a benchmark or two id also like to,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
lets go into safari very quickly and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
maybe do a quick search for cinebench,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just so you can kind of see it running,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
through,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres cinebench,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and id actually like to switch windows,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
and open up the app store,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these are all the first time im opening,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these apps as a quick side note so not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
only do i want to run a quick benchmark,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
ill actually also render some 4k video,0.0,0.318,0.682,-0.4215,Negative
footage in final cut pro because that is,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2732,Negative
what i use to edit my videos so let me,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
get that installed so final cut pro is,0.0,0.254,0.746,-0.3353,Negative
installed however before we even open,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that id like to run a cinebench but,0.226,0.0,0.774,0.1901,Positive
just keep in mind that i did just boot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this up for the first time and just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
signed in and nothing is really fully,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
transferred over or installed yet all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right so lets run the benchmark i will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
let you know the results,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all right as our test finishes up lets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
take a look and see what the final score,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is i do want to make a note that the fan,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.3818,Positive
actually did turn on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and it really wasnt that loud you could,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
barely hear it when i sat at a normal,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
distance from the laptop there we go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
7770 lets begin the single core,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
test and the single core benchmark just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
finished at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
1505 and i did not hear the fan turn on,0.0,0.197,0.803,-0.2411,Negative
with this test and keep in mind this is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
apples baseline processor for apple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
silicon now lets open up final cut pro,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2732,Negative
and actually get some 4k video files on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the macbook pro and render out some,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
video and check it out right when you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
open up final cut pro for the first time,0.0,0.208,0.792,-0.2732,Negative
it is optimized for apple silicon so it,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.4588,Positive
is already having improved performance,0.437,0.0,0.563,0.4767,Positive
and efficiency on mac computers with,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
apple silicon so weve got our files,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
transferred over lets just do a real,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quick test lets start a new project,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
call it test,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
import media and once we allow it access,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
lets go into test and select all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and hit import selected and they are all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ready to go that was actually really,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
quick uh importing those files now lets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
throw some of the video files into the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
timeline to kind of give you an idea of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
how quick or laggy that it actually will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
be uh so far so good and in comparison,0.337,0.0,0.663,0.6213,Positive
to be honest ive been using my,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.5106,Positive
2016 macbook pro my 15 inch macbook pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for a while now for video editing so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this does feel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fast and snappy heres a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know scrubbing on some video seems,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to be very accurate uh and precise with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it all right so with no edits made here,0.0,0.237,0.763,-0.3566,Negative
is about a 10 minute video of just 4k,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
video footage so lets export that and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
see how long it takes for us as a side,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
note im not going to render this in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
prores were just going to do h264,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all right and there it is finished at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
about nine minutes 30 seconds for like i,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive

of the macbook,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pro m1 comes with a measly 256 gigs on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
board which when youre video editing is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
about as useful as a condom machine in a,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
nunnery so i naturally said bollocks to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that and sparked up another 400 quid,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

over 3 gigabits per second,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and just under that for writing files,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is a solid effort overall,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.1531,Positive
comparable to rivals like the dell xps,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
13 and i gotta say while my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
expectations certainly werent met on,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.34,Positive
the performance front mostly thanks to,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
apples ridiculous boss,0.0,0.556,0.444,-0.3612,Negative
and the ceaseless parotin online the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook pro m1 definitely did impress me,0.528,0.0,0.472,0.6808,Positive
when it came to the battery life i found,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that even when i was video editing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in final cut pro i would get around nine,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2732,Negative
hours of nonstop use from a single,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the likes of google chrome i used to do,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
a bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
scripting or whatever while streaming,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

nine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hours of use which is definitely better,0.528,0.0,0.472,0.6808,Positive
than most windows rivals,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and so after actually using the apple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook pro m1 as my fulltime laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in between other reviews naturally would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i recommend it to,0.556,0.0,0.444,0.3612,Positive
fine fork well i know ive dumped on it,0.336,0.233,0.431,0.0516,Positive
from a great height quite a bit,0.506,0.0,0.494,0.6249,Positive
in this review but thats only because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
my expectations were rather high,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because of apple itself and naturally,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the echo chamber that is the internet,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the fact of the matter is the macbook,0.136,0.0,0.864,0.0258,Neutral
pro m1 is a perfectly fine,0.667,0.0,0.333,0.7184,Positive
creative laptop especially thanks to the,0.604,0.0,0.396,0.7264,Positive
fantastic battery life,0.643,0.0,0.357,0.5574,Positive
on this thing definitely really handy if,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
you want to be editing on the go,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
at some point in 2021 when we can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually leave our houses again and the,0.0,0.167,0.833,-0.0516,Negative
performance is good,0.592,0.0,0.408,0.4404,Positive
as i stated before if you actually stick,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to apples own rulebook but if you want,0.172,0.0,0.828,0.1154,Positive
to be using thirdparty software and the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like youre not going to get any,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
benefits from the m1 that you wouldnt,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
get from much cheaper windows devices,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so thats what i personally think of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook pro m1 would be great to hear,0.369,0.0,0.631,0.6249,Positive
from you five volk as well though,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive

okay so i just came back from the apple,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
store with the brand new empty macbook,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2023,Negative
pro and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
obviously this is the most underwhelming,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
product from the apple event but i do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
want to try a few things i want to see,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.1531,Positive
if the speakers are any different and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the microphones the camera and most,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
importantly i want to see the,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.3818,Positive
performance of that m2 chip but first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lets quickly unbox it the wallpapers,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
are technically the same the reason why,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one looks different is because this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is the silver whereas this is the box of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the space gray but if you look at images,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the silver boxes for the m1 they,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually havent changed the wallpaper,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
at all its the same box i want to see,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
if theres anything different inside the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
box if we get any changes in terms of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the manual or the accessories so ive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
had a look at all the accessories and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
everything is exactly the same as on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1 model with one exception and that is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the charger so theres a new charger,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which has 67 watts of power delivery,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
compared to 61 watts which is what the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1 model have in fact this is actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the exact same charger that we get with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the base 14 inch macbook pro more about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the empty macbook pro right after this,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.2023,Negative
this video is sponsored by banverg and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

they can even use the same material for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
multiple items so that you have all of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
them matching perfectly check out,0.512,0.0,0.488,0.6369,Positive
bandwicks lineup by using the link,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
below and now back to the video so that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was the unboxing now lets get to the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
testing and these are the three macbooks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that i want to test the bass m2 the bass,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
m1 and the bass 14inch okay so this is,0.192,0.0,0.808,0.2263,Positive
a microphone and a camera test on the m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
13inch macbook pro and now this is the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m2 13inch macbook pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the sensor is exactly the same but the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
image processing might be a bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
different because of that m2 chip so let,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
me know if you see any improvements over,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
the m1 and now this is the 14 inch m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pro macbook pro this should be the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
overall best because it does have a,0.457,0.0,0.543,0.6369,Positive
1080p sensor compared to 720p on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
other ones but maybe the processing is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
worse than on the m2 so let me know how,0.0,0.256,0.744,-0.4767,Negative
does this compare to the m2 and the m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now lets do a speaker test and see if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres any differences between the m2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the m1 and also the 14 of course so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is the m1 macbook,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
someone said pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
stupid swipe right now im watching what,0.0,0.362,0.638,-0.5267,Negative
you did i put down now im at a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
disadvantage,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.4215,Negative
but i think that is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
honestly i couldnt hear any difference,0.429,0.0,0.571,0.4588,Positive
between the m2 and the m1 of course the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
40 inch was significantly better so now,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
i want to open up a few apps at the same,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
time and see if theres any difference,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
between the m2 and the m1 i would expect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the m2 to be a bit snappier,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in daytoday use and we should be able,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to see that in this test in three two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so i think the m2 was a tiny bit faster,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
than the m1 but the difference was like,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.5023,Positive
very difficult to see and now lets see,0.0,0.285,0.715,-0.4201,Negative
how it stacks up against the 14 inch in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
three two one go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but to me they looked pretty much the,0.381,0.0,0.619,0.6486,Positive
same okay and now i want to do some real,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.296,Positive
world tests and see what the difference,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually is between all of these three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbooks so first off i want to test the,0.183,0.0,0.817,0.144,Positive
disk speed to see if theres any,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
differences between the m1 and the m2 i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
would expect the m2 to maybe be a tiny,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit faster than the m1 and wow i am,0.352,0.0,0.648,0.5859,Positive
quite surprised because,0.523,0.0,0.477,0.2944,Positive
were getting about one gigabyte to 15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gigabytes per second slower speeds on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the m2 than compared to the m1 now our,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1 model does have 512 gigabytes of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
storage but even when we tested the 256,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it was actually getting similar speeds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to the 512 which means that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
maybe apple has put in a slower drive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
inside the m2 macbook pro than we had,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
last year or maybe our model has some,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sort of issue but we are seeing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
considerably slower speeds on the m2 and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then looking at the 14inch model were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seeing over five gigabytes per second,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
right and about the same in terms of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
read speeds which are about double the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ones on the m1 and uh like what four,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
gigabytes per second higher than on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m2 so in blender i rendered the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
classroom scene using the cycles cpu,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
renderer and the m1 rendered in 14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
minutes and 24 seconds the m2 in 12,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
minutes and 41 seconds and the m1 pro 14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
inch in 12 minutes and 12 so the m2 was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost as fast as the m1 pro so even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
though they have exactly the same core,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
counts the m1 pro has six high,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
performance cores too low performance,0.0,0.344,0.656,-0.2732,Negative
whereas the m2 has four and four,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
something else that ive noticed was the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
battery drain so the m1 lost eleven,0.0,0.299,0.701,-0.3744,Negative
percent the m2 lost ten percent and the,0.0,0.247,0.753,-0.3182,Negative
m1 pro lost 13 so the m2 was by far the,0.0,0.187,0.813,-0.3182,Negative
most power efficient out of the three,0.339,0.0,0.661,0.4728,Positive
now doing the exact same test but now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
using the gpu every single machine was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
considerably faster the m1 took 5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
minutes and 30 seconds the m2 took 4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
minutes and 11 seconds and the m1 pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
took 3 minutes and 49 seconds the m14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lost six percent and then the m2 and the,0.0,0.223,0.777,-0.3182,Negative
m1 pro both lost four percent so what,0.0,0.247,0.753,-0.3182,Negative
about video editing well here i have a,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
15 minute 4k h264 project one of our,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
previous camera comparisons uh this is a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very demanding project by the way and,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.2944,Negative
the m1 took 1 hour 2 minutes and 57,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seconds to export the m2 took 44 minutes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and 2 seconds so it was considerably,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
faster but then the m1 pro took 16,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
minutes and 18 seconds a huge difference,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
from even the m2 and in terms of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
battery drain the m1 lost 35 percent the,0.0,0.247,0.753,-0.3182,Negative
m2 lost 32 percent and the m1 pro lost,0.0,0.397,0.603,-0.5574,Negative
18,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so if youre video editing on a daily,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
basis and you have some complex projects,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then uh definitely go with the 14 inch,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
then in compressor im going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
transcode an 865 file uh to prores 4k,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the m1 took 2 minutes and 53 seconds the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m2 one minute and 13 seconds so big big,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
difference and the m1 pro took one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
minute and 14 seconds so the m2 was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually faster than the m1 pro by one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
second but the interesting thing here is,0.372,0.0,0.628,0.5499,Positive
that the m1 lost two percent but the m2,0.0,0.171,0.829,-0.1655,Negative
and the m1 pro didnt lose any battery,0.244,0.0,0.756,0.3089,Positive
at all so it looks like having dedicated,0.49,0.0,0.51,0.6969,Positive
hardware engines for this task is not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
only quicker but also way more power,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
efficient if you do a lot of transcoding,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
then the m2 and the m1 pro would be a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
big bump from the m1 now when it comes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to converting an h265 file to prores 6k,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in this case a six minute clip the m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
took six minutes and 59 seconds the m2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
two minutes and two seconds and the m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pro 2 minutes and 19 seconds so the m2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was once again faster here but now by a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
larger margin also the m1 lost four,0.0,0.277,0.723,-0.3182,Negative
percent m2 2 percent and m1 pro 1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay and now i want to do a logic pro,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.296,Positive
test essentially i have a selection of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
loads of tracks here and i want to see,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
how many they can each play uh until,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.34,Positive
they crash so for example this is the m1,0.0,0.252,0.748,-0.4019,Negative
with 68 tracks and as you can see it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
crashed but if i remove one track,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now were at 67,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it seems like this one can play,0.495,0.0,0.505,0.5994,Positive
67 tracks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
perfectly now on the m2 model i was able,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.6369,Positive
to play two more tracks so we have 69,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.34,Positive
tracks in total so very small difference,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
over the m1 and on the bass 14 inch i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was able to play 118 tracks which is,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.34,Positive
very interesting because the core count,0.374,0.0,0.626,0.4576,Positive
is exactly the same as on the m1 and the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m2 so the only difference is the memory,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in this one this has 16 gigabytes so it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seems like the memory does actually help,0.51,0.0,0.49,0.6369,Positive
these chips,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh play more tracks now lets try some,0.255,0.0,0.745,0.34,Positive
gaming so here i have word of warcraft,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is one of the few games that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually run natively on apple silicon,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so this is the best case scenario the m1,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.6369,Positive
pro got 31 frames per second the m2 got,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
415 so thats a pretty significant bump,0.581,0.0,0.419,0.6749,Positive
and then the m1 pro got 71 okay now in,0.174,0.0,0.826,0.2263,Positive
shadow of the tomb raider which is at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this point of you know the default mac,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gaming test if the m1 got 12 frames per,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
second the m2 got 17 and the m1 pro got,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
27 now shadow of the tomb raider does,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not run natively but it does use apples,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
metal api so it is more optimized than a,0.32,0.0,0.68,0.5095,Positive
lot of the other games and the two extra,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gpu cores did make a difference in terms,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of gaming but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
unfortunately the m1 pro has four more,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.34,Negative
gpu cores than the m2 which are vastly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
superior so in the end should you get,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.5423,Positive
the m2 macbook pro over plus adm1 or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
even the m1 pro well i think that if you,0.208,0.0,0.792,0.2732,Positive
already have an m1 you shouldnt upgrade,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
unless you do transcode a lot of footage,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because in that case the m2 was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
significantly faster than the m1 also,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
since apple is not selling the m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook pro anymore,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and youre just looking to buy a new m2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mac then this is a pretty good option,0.55,0.0,0.45,0.7269,Positive
however if you can find a good deal for,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
a refurbished or a used and one macbook,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pro then i do think that it should go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with that one instead definitely be on,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
the lookout for a 16 gigabyte of ram,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
model uh on ebay or amazon or apple,0.195,0.0,0.805,0.1779,Positive
refurbished as that one would give you a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tiny performance bump over the standard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and they would also be more future,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
proofed in the long run now if you do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
want to buy it brand new the base model,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
is pretty good um i would actually avoid,0.496,0.179,0.325,0.5994,Positive
upgrading because the moment you start,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
upgrading this you will actually get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very close in price to the 14 inch model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
from the start theres a 700 difference,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
between the two but if you bump the ramp,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to 16 gigabytes and the storage to 512,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to match the 14 inch the 14 inch would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
only be 300 more in which case i do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
believe that a 4k inch is definitely,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
worth it you get a significantly better,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.5859,Positive
display uh pro motion and mini led you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also get more ports and extra,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thunderbolts max safe fast charging you,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
also get a better keyboard or at least,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
with the lack of touch bar and of course,0.0,0.223,0.777,-0.3182,Negative
significantly better performance in the,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
graphics department but only do so if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you really need that extra performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats the 14 inch has to offer if you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
consider yourself a pro,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then you go with the 14 inch what im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really curious to see is how the m2,0.27,0.0,0.73,0.3804,Positive
macbook pro will compare to the new m2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook air i do have a feeling that,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.128,Positive
this year we will be seeing a bigger,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
performance difference between,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the air and the pro in fact when we were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
testing the m2 macbook pro we actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heard the fan being on almost all the,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
time during the blender test whereas the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1 model or even the 14 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they were pretty much silent so yeah,0.548,0.0,0.452,0.7241,Positive
definitely stay tuned to the channel,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive

Music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all right so the macbook pro 13 m1 has,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
been my daily driver now for the past,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
six months,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and i thought id give you some insight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
into what my experience has been like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
so lets go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the purpose of this video is to give you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
some insight into whether an m1 device,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is worth buying or not,0.322,0.0,0.678,0.2263,Positive
ill cover how the chip has held up over,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.4215,Negative
the past 6 months and if there have been,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
any issues that have shown up over time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also revisit some of the support issues,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
that i had back in december with the m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
chip and how the native apple silicon,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
support scene is looking today and also,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
give you my recommendation for whether,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to buy this or not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one of the main things that i was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
excited about before i got my hands on,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.34,Positive
the laptop was the idea that the company,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats creating these super powerful yet,0.748,0.0,0.252,0.836,Positive
cool to the touch tablets known as ipads,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
is now going to develop their own,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
processors for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptops which gave the promise of an,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
ultra powerful laptop that never gets,0.359,0.0,0.641,0.4215,Positive
hot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
essentially the couch developers dream,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.25,Positive
and when i first got the laptop this was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the first thing that i wanted to test,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and in my early testing it definitely,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
held up to the promise,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
it never got hotter than what i would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
call slightly below lukewarm and this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was also after,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heavy use but the question is how is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this held up six months later,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with updates and software installs and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
basically never turning the laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
off ever well it still never really gets,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
hot and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i would say that it gets like lukewarm,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
but never really hot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and to me this is just such a huge thing,0.223,0.0,0.777,0.3182,Positive
because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
generally i will actually use a laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in the way that its intended judging by,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the name at least,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is on top of my lap and the m1 is,0.153,0.0,0.847,0.2023,Positive
by far the most comfortable laptop to do,0.339,0.0,0.661,0.5563,Positive
this with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
compared to any other laptop that ive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tried none of them even come close,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yes it gets a little bit warmer after,0.48,0.0,0.52,0.5606,Positive
several hours of use but compared to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
literally all other laptops its cold,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the fan noise is still nonexistent,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
ive heard the fans,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
twice in six months now if youre in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a completely silent room and you,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
put your ear like right next to the,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
laptop then yes you could probably hear,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
something at some points,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but what im saying is like if you go,0.289,0.0,0.711,0.5023,Positive
about your working day as you normally,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then no you will never really detect the,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
fan noise,0.697,0.0,0.303,0.3182,Positive
when i say that ive heard them like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
twice in six months,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what i mean here is that ive like been,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
able to detect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
any sort of noise or noticed that the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fan started increasing in speed,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
so this is not to the point where like,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
all i could think about was the fan,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
noise its just to the point where i was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
able to detect that there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was some sort of noise which you know by,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
itself is really impressive i think,0.473,0.0,0.527,0.5563,Positive
but couple this with the performance,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that this machine is actually capable of,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
and it actually becomes like it really,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
becomes unfathomable what this is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all right so i tried to build or like,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
hold some sort of tension about like,0.248,0.257,0.495,-0.024,Neutral
whether i would recommend this or what i,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
think of it has it held up has it not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
held out but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
by now you probably know that i would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
definitely recommend this laptop but,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.3818,Positive
either way lets take a look at some of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the negatives of this laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so if we look back at when i first got,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the laptop there were definitely some,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
things that were not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ideal about it mainly thirdparty,0.459,0.0,0.541,0.5267,Positive
software not supporting apple silicon,0.0,0.376,0.624,-0.3412,Negative
so lets take a look at what i said,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
about that okay so in the video i,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
mentioned that homebrew wasnt supported,0.0,0.329,0.671,-0.2411,Negative
yet and that meant that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
installing certain things wasnt as easy,0.247,0.283,0.47,-0.0788,Negative
as just typing brew install,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but i didnt really have to wait too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
long because this was fully supported by,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3804,Positive
february of that year so i got the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop in mid december,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and it was supported in february which,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
means that right now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
homebrew is definitely supported fully,0.625,0.0,0.375,0.6124,Positive
supported on the apple silicon the next,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
thing that i said in the video was that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
flutter worked which,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was not quite the case it worked but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
only via the rosetta translator,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
process thingy which means that i was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
able to work with it but not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natively so how does this look today six,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
months later today flutter is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost a hundred percent natively,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
supported some things still use rosetta,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
to compile,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so its not fully optimized yet but i,0.0,0.236,0.764,-0.214,Negative
should also mention that flutter even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
via rosetta has worked really well ever,0.285,0.0,0.715,0.3384,Positive
since the start and i havent really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
noticed any like performance issues or,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
anything like that,0.556,0.0,0.444,0.3612,Positive
nor have i actually noticed any real,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
performance gains over time as like,0.551,0.0,0.449,0.5994,Positive
flutter started natively supporting,0.492,0.0,0.508,0.4404,Positive
apple silicon more and more,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which i think is really a testament to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
how good apple silicon actually is,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
that its able to like deliver this top,0.417,0.0,0.583,0.5106,Positive
of the line performance even via a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
translation process,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like rosetta after this i mentioned that,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
certain python libraries werent fully,0.344,0.0,0.656,0.2732,Positive
supported on apple silicon yet,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
and this was actually quite a big,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
problem for me because it meant that for,0.0,0.278,0.722,-0.4019,Negative
like,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612,Positive
several months i didnt even bother,0.337,0.0,0.663,0.2584,Positive
trying to program in python on my apple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1 and this is because like any time i,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
tried to it was just such a horrible,0.0,0.368,0.632,-0.5423,Negative
experience because of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the stuff just not being supported and,0.0,0.246,0.754,-0.2411,Negative
it just meant that i was like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
running into bug after bug after bug,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
however now most python libraries seem,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to work for the things that ive tried,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
scikitlearn for instance which i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mentioned in the video now has full,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
support and if there are any like niche,0.464,0.0,0.536,0.6369,Positive
python libraries out there that dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
work,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yet then they will actually work via,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
rosetta and like i said i havent really,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
found any performance issues or anything,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like that using rosetta,0.455,0.0,0.545,0.3612,Positive
and to me its just been super smooth,0.358,0.0,0.642,0.5994,Positive
even though i would say like im not the,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
most rigorous python programmer out,0.0,0.374,0.626,-0.3384,Negative
there that uses,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tons of obscure libraries or anything,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like that but right now i work in python,0.2,0.0,0.8,0.1901,Positive
without any issues and ive been doing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so for the past couple months so the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
apple silicon support system has grown,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
really rapidly in the past six months,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and i would say that probably in like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
another six months,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it will probably be hard to find things,0.0,0.167,0.833,-0.1027,Negative
that dont actually support apple,0.0,0.361,0.639,-0.3089,Negative
silicon,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and also i would say that all the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
problems that i mentioned are very like,0.294,0.284,0.421,0.024,Neutral
developer specific,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
meaning that if youre like a regular,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
user then you wouldnt have even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
noticed any of these issues if you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bought your laptop in the past couple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
months,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all right so now let me just take a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quick second to talk about brilliant who,0.388,0.0,0.612,0.5859,Positive
very kindly agreed to sponsor this video,0.54,0.0,0.46,0.707,Positive
if you havent heard about brilliant,0.0,0.381,0.619,-0.4717,Negative
brilliant is a website and app designed,0.432,0.0,0.568,0.5859,Positive
for learning about math and science,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they have tons of really interesting,0.374,0.0,0.626,0.4576,Positive
courses on computer science that i think,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you guys would really enjoy,0.466,0.0,0.534,0.5413,Positive
when i was in school me and a lot of my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
classmates would use brilliant to learn,0.432,0.0,0.568,0.5859,Positive
about certain complex topics,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.2732,Positive
in computer science like certain,0.605,0.0,0.395,0.5574,Positive
algorithms or math concepts,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that we felt our teachers didnt do a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great job of explaining,0.577,0.0,0.423,0.6249,Positive
so brilliant really earns its name by,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.624,Positive
actually being a brilliant way to learn,0.432,0.0,0.568,0.5859,Positive
if youre interested in computer science,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
math or science in general,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then i would highly recommend going to,0.358,0.0,0.642,0.4201,Positive
holden to sign up for free the first 200,0.292,0.0,0.708,0.5106,Positive
people will get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
20 off their annual premium membership,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay so the next thing that i want to,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.296,Positive
mention just quickly is the battery life,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and this is again of course quite insane,0.0,0.3,0.7,-0.4576,Negative
which,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like i mentioned at the start i never,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
turned off my laptop really in the past,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
six months ive turned it off maybe like,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
four times,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so its basically always on and the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
battery life is really really good and i,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.5379,Positive
think its really worth emphasizing,0.354,0.0,0.646,0.2944,Positive
because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in terms of everyday use i dont even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
know how long it lasts because i charge,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it so rarely,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now thats not to say that its like it,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
lasts several months or anything like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
that its just that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it lasts so many days that i forget when,0.0,0.213,0.787,-0.2263,Negative
i charged it last,0.0,0.474,0.526,-0.2023,Negative
its to the point now where it feels,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kind of foreign to get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the low battery notification i feel like,0.291,0.244,0.465,0.1027,Positive
this whole video basically comes across,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as pretty much as biased as it gets,0.283,0.186,0.531,0.2732,Positive
and it probably seems like im like the,0.455,0.0,0.545,0.6124,Positive
biggest apple fanboy out there and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im really not that at all i like apple,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
but i also really like,0.552,0.0,0.448,0.5704,Positive
dell i like lenovo i like racer hp,0.556,0.0,0.444,0.6124,Positive
and all those laptops i get really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
excited about its just that,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.34,Positive
now none of them really seem to compare,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in my opinion one might be slightly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
faster in a specific test,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and one might have slightly longer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
battery life or faster wake up time but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
none of them seem to be able to combine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all these features in one machine the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
way that apple has done here and knowing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1x or m2 or whatever apple well call,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
it is probably right around the corner,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it just feels like,0.455,0.0,0.545,0.3612,Positive
amd and intel have a lot of catching up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to do in order to beat,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
apple also as a side note the wake up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
time is still crazy fast,0.0,0.375,0.625,-0.34,Negative
like i said i never turn it off and it,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
still wakes up before i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
finished opening the laptop up so would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i recommend this laptop,0.556,0.0,0.444,0.3612,Positive
big reveal coming,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
no i would never of course i would,0.0,0.306,0.694,-0.296,Negative
recommend this laptop,0.556,0.0,0.444,0.3612,Positive
of course i would recommend it a,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
thousand percent i would recommend this,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
laptop i would recommend you to get,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
any apple m1 laptop that you can find,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whether its the macbook air or the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook pro uh,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really i just think that it seems like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
its the best choice of laptop that you,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.6369,Positive
can get right now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the reason for this is i really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
believe that this laptop will hold up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for several years to come,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
famous last words but in all seriousness,0.0,0.178,0.822,-0.0772,Negative
i really think that apple went out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quite hard here to really distinguish,0.0,0.253,0.747,-0.1761,Negative
themselves as better than intel and amd,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
so they probably poured almost all they,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were capable of into this chip,0.342,0.0,0.658,0.3818,Positive
to make sure that it was a success i,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.7184,Positive
mean their entire 2 trillion,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yes thats 2 trillion dollar business,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
at least somewhat depended on this chip,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
being successful so my guess,0.487,0.0,0.513,0.5859,Positive
is that the m1x or the m2 or the mx,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whatever apple ends up calling it will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
probably not be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that big of an upgrade compared to the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m1 and im not an expert or anything,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like this but,0.467,0.0,0.533,0.1901,Positive
im just thinking that like if the next,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
chip is as big of an upgrade as the m1,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then we basically probably need to look,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
into what kind of dark magic,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
apple has developed that basically,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
allows them to put themselves,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this far ahead of everyone else anyway,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats it for this one i hope you,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
enjoyed it,0.767,0.0,0.233,0.5106,Positive
and i also want to mention that im,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
actually creating courses over on,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.296,Positive
patreon right now and one of my most,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
recent ones is how to build a trading,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is available in full on my patreon,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
account which means that you can just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
basically,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sign up once and then you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
unsubscribe straight away and youll,0.322,0.0,0.678,0.2263,Positive
have access to the full course,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if you want to but also no pressure to,0.09,0.439,0.471,-0.6652,Negative
do that i really just appreciate that,0.373,0.0,0.627,0.4549,Positive
you watched this video,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and that you watched it this far so yeah,0.264,0.0,0.736,0.4341,Positive
thank you for watching and i hope ill,0.443,0.23,0.328,0.3818,Positive
see you in the next one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
