Plus Samsung will definitely get rid of the headphone jack soon enough and get with the times because it39s the future and we all want better sound which the lightning port provides and the headphone jack just got old like really its more than 100 years old and most of us don39t like wires and we should all be related to that because even Samsung brags about their wireless charging which is technically not wireless if u still have to have a wire connected to the wall or a computer and the new airpods provide awesome sound even thought their wireless with the new chip they have inside like really lets be real here and not just followers apple is doing the best Job so far even in speed with the new A10 Fusion chip not to mention that the iPhone 6sd that came out a year ago is faster than the newest Samsung flagship that being the time bomb galaxy note 7,0.137,0.018,0.844,0.9578,Positive
Wow you39re actually wrong you39re just another android user that wants Samsung to sell more smartphones to seem better because new reviews show that the iPhone 739s display is the best display  out there even better than your tv i bet u probably have a cheap Samsung tv the reason you say the quotSamsung39s display is betterquot than the iPhone 7 is because u let your self go with the specs and u think bigger is better and obviously is not being the fact that a less pixel display is better than Samsung,0.193,0.03,0.777,0.9477,Positive

Honestly I disagree with you on the tossup between the s7 edge and the note 7 I received an s7 edge as a loaner during the recall and I was very disappointed with the device39s performance I may have gotten a bad unit but the one I received got warm much faster than my original note and was much warmer overall with any sort of moderate use as well as wireless charging The phone lagged quite often too especially when bringing up the keyboard on screen and the battery life was miserable Wrapping an 8 hour work day my note was generally around 57 is percent while my S7 Edge was consistently around 35 I had everything set up almost the same for both devices but the S7 always seemed to burn through battery awfully fast for sitting in a pocket One day it actually became so warm in my pocket that I was worried about permanent damage to the device it was EXTREMELY hot to the touch just from sitting IDLE Overall though I39m VERY happy with the Note 7 and this is coming from a person who I had the iPhone 4 4s 5 6 6 plus and 6s plus as well as more than a handful of Android phones including the galaxy s5 s6 droid incredible droid RAZR and a few others I won39t be switching back to iOS for quite awhile,0.1,0.084,0.816,0.5984,Positive

Great review as always Marques keep up the good work A few things though brbr1 This is most likely a bug with Samsungs aggressive power management features when the device is locked They majorly downclick the CPU in order to save battery life The problem by doing this is if a computational task is already going on when you39re unlocking the phone it will lag until the unlock process completes and upclocks the processor to typical levels Samsung is probably more aggressive with this on the Note because of it39s smaller battery You39ve probably noticed it with a handful of Android devices brbr2 I39m guessing that you39re writing this review before the waterresistant iPhone came out But the speakers on the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are amazing with waterresistant speakers So at least in my opinion the lower tinny sound from the S7 S7 Edge and Note are no excuse at this point,0.081,0.072,0.847,0.5423,Positive

It39s funny how Apple vs Android comments will never end Rarely hear a mention jailbroken iPhones in those arguments or software people prefer to use on either system or that they are TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN It very vaguely reminds me of religion vs science both are looking to do the same thing find the truth Except religions can be a bit quotout therequot Science prefers to physically go quotout therequot and find the truth the hard way nothing worth accomplishing is easy,0.113,0.063,0.825,0.6842,Positive

Startup lag its because the OS is probably clearing your RAM and cache assuming u will use something new when u start it up again Sadly what that means is that you have a paging lag as the pages are pulled into memory No big dealanything with a virtual memory will have this lag depending upon how well the page reuse scheme aligns with your usage behaviorbrbrMarques Brownlee What do you think is the best portablesmall yet powerful and longlasting in terms of battery life smartphone Personally I like to run with my phone and take it everywhere and big phones 5 inch and  screen size is not my thing Thanks and great video Note 7 gt Best phone in the markettotally get it,0.156,0.104,0.74,0.8553,Positive

You see Marques I have an HTC One M7 and comparing its display against my friend39s Galaxy S6 it shows the better sharpness on the HTC despite the Samsung having the higher resolution and PPI So I was wondering if that39s because of the Pentile matrix on the S6 I mean it39s quite evident the HTC having the sharper display when comparing with my own eyes and since the S6 has almost the same display as the Note 7 what do you think about this,0.035,0.0,0.965,0.4404,Positive

Samsung Lag Even MKBHD mentioned it Daily use can be irritating especially when you wake your device up and the phone is stalling and jumpy trying to catch up with user input and also when your notification shade gets choppy The Note 7 is a great device however but Samsung has not married the optimizations properly with Snapdragon processors and it39s pain to see other companies like HTC and LG along with Google Nexus devices run smoother and snappier than Samsung39s offerings especially for the price Samsung wants you to pay I will be waiting for the S8 I returned my Note 7 for a refund a month back I39m hoping Exynos makes it to the S8 in the US Version,0.074,0.114,0.812,-0.2844,Negative

It is not worth the price Full stop It is bias to suggest it is IMO By release time in Nov UK at 850 it will have a year old chipset that has been superseded All it has over the S7 Edge is the Spen and if that is not your thing then the gimmicks like the iris scanner are not enough for the 400 extra it costs over the S7Edge Bearing in mind the battery life is much better on the s7 Edge and it is a better performing phone with few issues this is a very one sided review No mention of the sub par performance on anything intensive terrible RAM management disappointing battery life many reviews struggle to get 34 hours scratchy GG5 only 4gb RAM no options for 128 or 256 GB storage USBC data rates seemingly not up to standard etc You can still support Samsung but a balanced review is always better and this was not IMO,0.067,0.077,0.856,0.2998,Positive

In all cases of the note 7 quotexplodingquot the fire department hasn39t been able to point the cause directly to the note 7 They said it might39ve been the cause but it39s not certain Also since the note 7 has usbc it takes more power from the charger and when you use a noncertified third party cable that will cause major problems for the battery Instead of bitching about all of this I would rather praise Samsung for taking back ALL note 739s and exchanging then for a new batch Apple hasn39t done that ever and mostly will not in the future,0.078,0.093,0.829,0.0846,Positive

Sorry the exploding issue has not been fixed as phones are still being recalled and replaced The damage to Samsung39s reputation cannot be underestimated or fixed overnight nor will it not affect their sales From a marketing and PR standpoint the exploding issue is a disaster and it will take time for them to regain trust of the market place It39s a brilliant phone but you wouldn39t trust an expensive Jaguar or Rolls Royce series with a reputation for exploding in hot weather sadly the Note 7 can now never be considered the best phone of 2016 or the best Galaxy Note ever that prize will remain with the Note 4 which Samsung still sells to this day the two Subsequent versions of the Note series have been blown up stylus versions of the  S6 and S7 series albeit with excellent hardware Shame about the explosions,0.183,0.079,0.738,0.9677,Positive

Nice review but Upgrading from the S7 edge to the Note 7 has more benefits than just a S pen brbr1 Touch ID has definately been improvedbr2 The Iris scanner is very useful for wet or gloved hands and its hell fast once it get used wth your eye br3 The S pen of course br4 The display is definately brighter and the HDR is noticeable br5 I have the dual sim so a 64gig HD is very useful br6 It is a much better feel in the hand and its best looking mobile in a market br7 The USB Type C and multiple benefits br8 The upgraded software and battery saving improvements are very useful br9 Change over now and you get a good resell value on your s7 edge br10 The larger screen is always appreciated even if its only minor br11 Finger print scanner is coolbrIn s7 edge you need to light up screen then you have to use finger print but in Note 7 you just have to click the home key  finger print recognize right away brAnd it39s fast i love my note 7brbrThank you  hope this helps,0.282,0.046,0.673,0.9957,Positive

Honestly the nutshack isnt that bad in my opinion just some of the voice acting is iffy and some visualsjokes are kinda hard to listenlook at but its not as bad as some say it was that said i think if they toned down on the nasty jokes a bit and payed a little more attention to the voice acting the nutshack may have stayed around for more seasons The people working on the nutshack had a lot of fun on the show which is nice,0.187,0.061,0.753,0.9081,Positive
