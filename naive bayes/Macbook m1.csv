god damn this macbook could be way faster than my dell
Who else rewatches Marques&#39; videos just to enjoy the intros and exceptional cinematography? Just me?
Sir really love you
I can&#39;t run any games on this thing!! It&#39;s paperweight!!
I just bought one for editing GoPro footage.  The built in h264 and h265 reading sealed the deal for me.
Really good analysis and explanation of the Macbook pros.  Great great job. Thank you.
RIP TOUCHBAR

who&#39;s watching this on their M1 Max Macbook ?

“Only 64G ram”
Where do I find the groot??
How the F they dont put an USB A port , maaaan is needed
we are planning to buy MacBook Pro 16 inch M1 pro.

Thanks! I just ordered this MacBook because some douche stole my Backpack with my MacBook Pro 2018… this video helped immensely with my decision and my sadness!
I had to get this beast. My god
Why do they have to charge so much for these

What are those in the back, left side?
what system monitoring application could you recommend for M series MacBooks?

bruh 4 mins and 6 seconds for exporting is just mind blowing and also it is just a laptop not a supercomputer or something. That&#39;s impressive
nice one
I really want just normal USB ports, I have nothing that uses USB-C honestly. I hope someone relates.






I got mine in the mail yesterday and omg so amazing. I have never had an Apple computer but I am happy my first one was this one.
But when can we play games on them

👆🏿 👆🏿 Contact him for help in any difficulty or challenge you are facing with your device.
Hi I have a MacBook pro. It&#39;s in good condition however it&#39;s not turning on. If anyone knows how to fix it or would like to purchase it&#39;s parts inform me. I thought it did not last long at all. I live in a hot place.

Your reviews are very thorough, cheers!
Got one at work and agree, next league machine
Been using for a year now for coding, it&#39;s very very fast and the battery lasts through out a day of work.
That&#39;s where the iphone 14 notch went
What headphones should I purchase for maximum clarity and great volume? I&#39;m not familiar. I&#39;ll be doing audio and video editing...

Awesome review.  Thanks as always!  My work has the 16&quot; M1 Pro Macbook Pro as an option for the refresh!  Mine should come in today!
I use mine as a backup which doubles as a bad ass stand for my iPad Pro.
20 hour battery life doing not much but try loading Parallels 18 and MS Word under it and the battery can&#39;t do 2 hours!  I&#39;m going back to my 17.3&quot; Acer, running Linux Mint.  Amazingly fast and great battery life.  Oh, yeah, and it has both Del and Back keys without having to buy a $250 Apple keyboard.  And the Acer is a $600CDN Windows 7 machine from 2017 that I upgraded for free thanks to Linux Mint. (my sister&#39;s hand-me-down)
Semangat
How much there is usable space in the 1TB model of this?


add ethernet on brick, and one usb 3.0 port and its a dream machine
Ethernet on brick would be incredible!!!!!!
I have watched this vid 3 times!
Mkbhd, mistake on onscreen graphics, M1 Pro was meant to be M1 Max @mkbhd
Quality review
How asinine is it that their Mac Pro customers that spent a real-estate down payment on that overpriced piece of shit are now left holding the bag?
They remove the touch bar above the keyboard. I&#39;m quite disappointed.

Hi<br>I’m really in need of that MacBook Pro 16” M1 max<br>This is bc I’m going to high school and I don’t have enough money to buy one myself so it would be really grateful of you to gift me that macbook

Hi, I’m almost in high school and I’m really in need for a MacBook Pro 16” and this is the MacBook that I have always dreamed for I wish I had it
I got the absolute base model 16” M1 Pro model, and even there, it’s been a complete beast. By far, even to this day, if someone asked me what my favourite Apple product was, it’s this. I tested the waters on the final Intel 16” MBP to see if the largest spec’d model could facilitate my workflow of OBS streaming, Photoshop/Final Cut Pro, multi-tab Chrome browsing, and other little small-bite apps doing work like FTP/chatting/etc. in the background. It absolutely couldn’t even do the first step of OBS streaming, immediately ramping up the fans when opening the app, and by the time the app even started to render a preview window, it started to throttle down to a point where it’s unusable.<br><br>The base 16” M1 Pro MBP not only never ever kicks up the fan enough for me to hear them, but it now runs my 100+ layer Photoshop documents (multiple), 10-15 usual tabs on Chrome, every single extra dock/full-res preview and actual streaming on OBS, and all my other apps like Discord, Transmit (FTP), Music, and even a queue’d up demanding Handbrake video conversion. It does all of this at once, whisper silent, with a maximum of some very slight warmth when you touch the aluminum right next to the fan. I couldn’t even imagine how much better this works for even more complex workflows with the higher spec options, considering mine is the absolute lowest-end M1 Pro chip running off of 16GB of RAM. Just madness, fantastic work Apple.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m31s">16:31</a> 768 gb of ram how it&#39;s possible?
is this MacBook pro 16 good for graphic designing? using Adobe illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.
Any music producers here, amateurs or professionals, using one of these? What do you think so far?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> Should say &quot;M1 Max MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>&quot;, correct?
768 GB fking RAM 🤯🤯🤯
Im sad that i didnt wait for this :) i got the 2020 one insteas

Marques, I just love your content, man!
REMEMBER: it’s called a notchbook

So wait, I can’t connect my Samsung QN90B tv into the Mac and get more than 60hz because it’s only HDMI 2.0. Are there any connections it has that would support 4K 144hz?
very helpful. 10 out of 10
Well, they didn&#39;t even put FaceID on iMac with that thicker screen. So you know Apple is being Apple again overthinking the whole mechanism.
Marques Brownlee, I sooooo genuinely enjoy watching your reviews and yes, I just ordered the MacBook Pro 14&quot; with 32GB Ram. All I&#39;ll be using it for is purely for music composition. This is the first time to have a MacBook Pro as normally I&#39;m based on iMac&#39;s, MacPro and iPad Pro. I have had MacBook in the passed along time ago, but I was advised that the best for a small home music studio will be a MacBook Pro 14&quot;. Thank you for your brilliant and positivity you bring to us in a happy and sincere way. Jean-Claude from Melbourne, Australia ...
my wife is a photographer and we recently purchased the 14 inch model. She defiantly needs it for editing but that means I also get to have fun with it even though I would never need something this nice lol.
basically all i want is a silent laptop for moderate to high workloads and something that doesn&#39;t burn your thighs when doing so. Is this the laptop to do it?

my 13” macbook air 2012  has lasted me almost 10 years now… still going strong even though battery sucks and cooling fan is so loud now… looking to buy a mac pro this time so this was helpful. i wish they at least offered the air in 16” or something else other than 13” since i definitely don’t need all this performance lol
Well like everyone else is saying. I probably won’t hit the limits of this laptop.. but apple quality it will last 10 years and still have enough power to run everything in 7 years from now. So if you think about it… it’s actually cheap. I don’t have to buy another laptop for 7-10 years
why in the Sam Hill is the Magsafe connector not the 90 degree style??? Tim Cook needs to go, absolute disappointment...
Let&#39;s hope it works with music recording and writing as my last Windows PC crashed and destroyed SSD card multiple times.
apple: we remove ports so that when we add them back you think its a feature
I surely do need one of these for online classes. LOL😆
So it’s normal for the for MacBook Pro 14 1tb to heat up easily I exchanged mine 3 times and they all heat up quickly so is it normal for them to heat up while doing basic things or playing games?
normalize reviewing the base model

I just ordered my new M1 MacBook Pro 14 inch Sunday. I am still using my 2013 13”MacBook Pro which still works great but I think it is going to be great update.
I’m picking between the 14 inch MacBook Pro and the 13 inch m2 MacBook Air.

That notch is ugly asf I swear


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m47s">9:47</a> C2C - The Cell?? 😯 I thought I&#39;m the only person who listens to that song 😄 nobody knows it!!

Marques please honest answer to my question : Should I wait for the m2 chip 16” ? Is it true that is not going to come to next year ?






14-inch is like the most perfect laptop I&#39;ve ever seen in my life, except for gaming. I returned my 16-inch M1 Pro for a 14-inch one and I love it. Maybe I&#39;d use 16 if I was a content creator.


I can&#39;t wait to use this as a scroll through facebook and instagram
I think Apple (or any other laptop manufacturers) should start to inegrate a wirless charger, beside the touchpad, for iphone, airpods and/or apple watches.
Hmm but mine gaming laptop charger is 280w
Now he’s changing his stance. He use to tell people to move out no matter what from home and now rent is a waste of money? How cant a 18 year old buy  a house to move out.
Whoa the new update for the iPhone no please videos from YouTube using the full screen of the iPhone.
Just got mine for work, really excited
“…dramatically better than they have any business doing.” Ha! For you to say that it must be damn sure true , nice
Can this support 2 1440 and 1 4k display?
Love your presentation.  Your face looks like an emoji!  Love it
I honestly HATE that they got rid of the Touchbar! It seems not many people know about BetterTouchTool, which fully unlocks the TB and many other features, like remapping the tilde key as the Escape key on my 2017 MBP since they were stupid enough to remove the physical Escape key and put it as a digital key on the Touchbar. BetterTouchTool is insanely amazing and I have the Touchbar setup for shortkeys in Photoshop, Illustrator, Firefox and the general Mac settings. I agree that it&#39;s a bit sad they charge so much for the new MBP and yet still use older tech inside when newer tech is available. I will sadly very very much miss the Touchbar when I upgrade to a newer MBP. Seems I will have to get used to using Touch Portal on my older iPad for hotkeys.
I just got one and after 4 days return to Apple, thanks for return policy. Apple put a mobile processor into laptop and no much supported software available also the GPU within that price range is useless (Cuda cores 180% less). Boot camp is major drawback where parallel wants share resources not fully throttled, hardly play any game bcz of ARM architecture. Sad
💯✅💥🧧
Just got a new job at a new company, they gave me one of these. I’m a data engineer where all of my processing is done via the cloud.  I also have my own keyboard, mouse, and two monitor setup. Why did they give me this? I could do my job on a chrome book. I don’t even think this can use two external monitors.

Thank You Very Much for the BEST REVIEW I ever heard about these New M1 Mac Books.
Glad I found this video again. Looking to buy a m2 air but it’s gonna cost 1,700 to spec it out for my needs. Now I know I should just get the the M1 Pro to save money and get more performance
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=07m00s">07:00</a> they cant as its meant only for magsafe3 as such if you were, how would magsafe port which is just charging relay internet? if it was through USBC(thunderbolt) I would agree, but for magsafe would not work.
🤯🤯
I would like this chip in a Windows machine. I don&#39;t care for MacOs. It had benefits if you stay within the system.

what alternatives would you recommend?
The notch is a huge bother for me. Been patiently waiting for them to remove them off the iPhone and here they go adding it to the macbooks. Having a huge notch like so is unnecessary for the hardware and  aesthetically unpleasing. Guess I’ll sit for the new MacBook models to come out which will be a few years.

Intro song please!!!
God knows how much money you got to do this

Could someone link the intro song? Or at least tell me what the name of the song is?
Hi Marques, I experience that even M1 Max Macbook Pro lags when working on Microsoft Excel. Why the most powerful Macbook will lag running such a basic program. If you have a few graphs and if you scroll through the sheet you will see graphs popping up. The data/graph is not visible immediately. It takes a few seconds for the data/graph to appear. What is your suggestion for someone who wants to use a Macbook but needs to run Microsoft Excel daily? Could you please let us know what you think?
You have hdjxjxjcjjxxj
Gorgeous laptop, and excellent review (as usual) Hopefully Apple will give the owners of these laptops the right to repair them!
Definitely an upgrade. Finally got the 14 inch and no regrets buying it.

When is the M2 Pro in 14” coming?
After waiting two months, I pick mine up in two days. Fully packed, 64Gb, 2TB. The anticipation is killing me. First new computer in over 10 years.



Glad to see that they provide the charger 🤣
Yea, Apple needs to hire you! This was amazing! Thank you.
Did he just say 768 gb of ram !!!?





I have the 14in. Legit got a day and a half at work on just the battery with normal usage.
As always no bullshit. No extra minutes of gibberish. I just got the M1 Pro 14 inch 1 TB and…… i foooooking love it man.
My dad is going to spend $6,000 on the latest MacBook Pro 16 inch M1 Max with 8 TB. He&#39;s going all out. We wanted to watch this video to see if it was worth it. Thank you! Very well done video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m50s">9:50</a> .. the most lowkey flex I’ve EVER seen with Obama Lmao
I think one thing to keep in mind with performance is future proofing. When I was 18 I bought a $1900 MacBook Pro with the upgraded processor, memory and RAM. I was just going to use it for college and didn’t need all the power, but that computer ended up lasting me 7 and a half years before the performance was too slow. You may not need the power now, but if you pay up now, this could easily last you 5-7 years.
















I actually buy this
there is one mistake when you talked about the export time you said the maxed out 16 inch macbook pro  on the display it says m1 pro
Marques I hope you see this comment! Do you know if I can connect the 16inch m1 max MacBook Pro to the new studio display and basically use the MacBook as a secondary display??

m1 or m2  for developer ios
Its like apple purposely waits to implement features so for when they implement the features customers freak out (now i know apple waits to better improve the technology but still my other point could be true too)
Dat intro tho!👌😎
marques needs to do affiliate links
Thanks dude, awesome walk-through. Made it easy for me to buy this laptop with custom options - 16&quot; 64GB RAM and 2TB SSD.
Awesome editing!!
I actually really liked the Touch Bar. Oddly enough, mostly for the volume control haha
Maybe its in Apple&#39;s &quot;making consumers annoying&quot; policy to not give both Face ID and touch ID in a single device
Hahahha my charger is 240 watts
super laptop .....
Pretty much confirmed what I was thinking about that chip, it is a feat of engineering.<br>What is the storage options you took?

Please help me with a Mac book pro please
&quot;one less dongle&quot;
I personally dislike how thick it is, I’m not a creator but I’d buy the MacBook Air with the M2 because it looks so sleek. Even though the Pro has ProMotion which is a mind struggle.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m00s">4:00</a> Apple listened to you about the colour matched connectors! 😂
I find it funny how Apple decided that fans don&#39;t need ports, but then backtracks and reverts to having ports for the actual users. Substance over form, any day! 🙌🏾
Can someone please give a Macbook Pro M1 Max?





i wish i can buy this 😇💸💰 RM10,799
Got the 16” recently, beast!
I like them, but when I saw them in person I fought the top parts felt quite tinny compared to the bottom portion. It just felt like the top could bend easily.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m30s">6:30</a> cause its business they dont use the higher end ports so you have to upgrade to the more expensive product that has them down they road. Business these days have multiple versions lined up to consume your pockets...  Miss the old days when it was more about passion and less about profit.
someone buy me this lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=19m15s">19:15</a> the engineering hour of work cost 25-35$ xD <br>If you have a team of 9 engineerings you would pay 225-315$ for hour .-. <br>If you save 1 hour per day, you save 20 hours per month ~~600$ per month for each engineer .-. <br>It’s incredible the engineers can go to home 1 hour after
Truly Apple boy &quot; Marques Brownlee &quot; ! Kudos ! You&#39;ve conveyed Apple&#39;s message to the Audience.
MacBook Pro review!<br>Very good!
Looks like they heard your idea <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m58s">3:58</a>
this feeling when you watch this on MBP 16 M1 2021. and this is your 1st mac ever. win user since win98. linux user since ubuntu 8.  And I&#39;m happy, but these shortcuts make me crazy.
I just can’t decided between 14” and 16”
Marques, did you scale the display resolution to &quot;more space&quot; on the 16&#39;?
It&#39;s a great computer but the black keyboards are ugly. Also these machines are so expensive I can get like three premium PCs for the price of One macbook. Like buying one macbook pro 14 or 16 inch with 16gb ram can get you three premium pcs over ten years. I will stick with windows PCs because Intel and AMD will catch up to Apple&#39;s chip performance. Save yourself some money and live with a longer rendering time. As to people who do not video edit and are content creators, you don&#39;t need a macbook pro.
Thank you, I needed this video!
i dont like the design. it looks like a combination of past and future design. wish they bring back the touchbar
2 types of people who will get these:<br>1. The tech geeks and software engineers<br>2. Sugar moms who want the most expensivist laptop to watch their 90-day fiance videos

I know this has been an issue with past MacBooks but for such an expensive machine the fact that anything can damage the screen when the laptop is closed is such a big flaw! I&#39;m talking about a spec of sand, food crumb anything small will damage the screen because of how close the screen is to the keyboard when the laptop is shut.
✌️🧡💚PEACE
i dont know why but i get a lil annoyed when somebody calls a macbook a laptop insted of a macbook
You
this is the best choice for graphic designers like me!
Oh, they have a <i>top notch</i> design, I see
That intro was CLEAN.
N As5 Up
&quot;Only have 64 GB of RAM&quot; lol
Best review I have seen of these two yet. Great work.
Anyone know what percentage of people actually do video editing?  I see absolutely no point of buying a new macbook if all you are doing is mail, youtube, and listening to music.
I connect to my tv and the notch goes away.💚
I wish someone would gift me that
I just got a 14in from work (I had a 15in 2017 MacBook Pro prior) and it&#39;s such an awesome upgrade. I don&#39;t do a ton of super in depth work on it, but I&#39;m exciting for when I have to start using Adobe on it more. Also, a cool little feature of the 2021 MacBook Pros. The USB-C ports also act as chargers. So if you forgot your charger or bought a back up for the USB-C of the prior models, you can use those to charge. In theory you could plug both in, but it&#39;ll only pull power from one.
No one with the crackling audio issue?
Content sponsored by apple
I barely use the touch bar, but I do enjoy it.  They could have easily put it above the function row.
Ah, I see how the design of these are reminiscent of the old 17-inch Macbook Pros from 2007 now
As someone who has never owned an apple product I must say this laptop is really nice especially compared to windows laptops! Only thing that I don&#39;t like is the smearing/ghosting when moving anything on the screen at 120hz. I bought this laptop for Blender 3d because Apple joined the dev fund to support Metal. Blenders viewport performance is extremely good and the trackpad support is perfect. I also just found out that Windows 10 Blender releases don&#39;t support trackpad gestures like Mac releases of blender do. I tried a trackpad on my windows 10 pc for Blender and it was terrible. But there is a patch D7660 Add support for precision touchpad gestures on Windows which I beleive is just now being integrated into blender on windows 10.
We need battery standby mode ( direct power)  in MacBook Pros and other devices!
Wow what a fantastic review.. thank you so much for your time to make it. so so good!!!
all that review and cant point out that if you want to see the year on your MacBook Pro, you need to study 1 year at NASA and there&#39;s no option to show the full date with the year on the top tab! &#39;s apple instead of going forward...
iMac or this new macbook ??
Gosh this notch i can’t keep my eyes from it it’s so ugly how can we get rid of it
been thinking about buying one… but nope.. F that notch. not going to happen
Looking for a laptop, as a finance major and need one more year until graduation and land a job. Looking at this lenovo x1 carbon and mac pro mostly bc of the battery and software. I am aware of the Excel shortcut, and Bootcamp.. Is it doable, or what do you recommend?
768gb RAM is overkill though 🥴
What exactly is this song called? The link leads to the channel not directly the song, I love it and I need it in my life, please tell me the name or send a link
Me who has an empty bank account: hmmm, interesting
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m16s">20:16</a> ok iLike it pikaso
why i cant see that high power mode at battery interface..macbook pro m1 pro 16unch
Im windows user but I cant find a good laptop that is durable and efficient as the MacBook Pro, so Im moving to Mac. I think is going to be good and fun for me. A new adventure.
For me as a music producer and gamer who uses both platforms- Windows and Mac I can confirm. Mac is a tool and an expensive one at that but for audio production I stick with my Mac for several reasons. Meanwhile, a PC is perfectly capable of being used as a good workstation, but (for me) Mac has never been about the fancy design and premium price. MacOS is much less annoying than Windows with its permanent driver problems, sound diseases and unstable programs. For gaming, however, I love my PC and nothing comes close! Mac remains as a tool for workstation applications with soon outdated hardware wich i can’t fix in the future.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m32s">9:32</a> Safari Sucks
Did they really remove USB ports? I use flash drives for transferring &quot;stuff&quot; between my two laptops. I wanna get this laptop when I start making money, but I think this is a bit ridiculous.


Truly next level... just got one, bootup time is 2x my 6 times cheaper laptop, keyboard also sucks. Battery is good, screen is nice, speakers good. Would not buy again.
Better cherish it before noticing the price tag
I liked the touch bar. I used it all the time.
Amazing tutorial
The styling is extremely backwards on this MacBook pro. It looks like a dinosuar.
next version they won&#39;t ship with a charger. For the environment .. ofc.
id eat a cougars asshole for one of these computers
Great video helped me choose which M1 to go with. I noticed there&#39;s display presets and was wondering if you use any? Do you think they&#39;re beneficial?
No fan noise even running hdmi on a big screen 4k ? My 2014 will start to wind up after a bit of HD video on my 55 or 65 via hdmi

Can&#39;t wait to buy a maxed one in 3-5 years <br><br>I got a maxed out 2014 in 2019 and it&#39;s still running amazingly. Hdmi and Magsafe return is awesome
Design looks like 5-8 years back
stop doing reviews let younger kids do them and get exposure
Even if you don&#39;t need the full potential of a Macbook it is still worth it in my opinion. The reason for that is that I have bought a Macbook Pro 3 years ago and it still works as if I bought it yesterday. The performance has not changed and it is one of my best long-term tech investments. <br>I had experience with two other laptops for a couple of years with Windows and their performance has decreased significantly after just one year of usage. Besides, the specs don&#39;t matter, because one of my laptops was a high-end gaming one and still sucked after one year.<br>The operating system is out of great importance!<br><br>So, my personal opinion is that Macbooks are way more expensive, but you can use them for at least 5-6 years without any problems or decrease in performance, which I believe is the better option.
Is the MacBook Pro for someone who edits photos on Lightroom? Also want to get into digital art. I would like to get into some gaming too but may just buy a gaming PC.
Anyone know how to disable auto boot from lid opeing in this laptop
My 5 year old 4 core i7 doing single thread machine learning compared to the m1 pro: 💩
The fact that a laptop with a chip you can get in a $3,500 configuration can beat the load times of a $50,000 machine when rendering video is insane. That is such a quick jump with Apple Silicon. Makes me excited for the future with M2, M3, etc. The power per watt is insane.
nice
Marques Brownlee is Ai
This is what I would like to see on future Macbook Pros.<br><br>1. FaceID (this is an easy software implementation).<br>2. Touch Screen displays (so many times I want to touch scroll and can&#39;t. Should be easy for Apple). <br>3. Bring back the 2 backlight control fn keys<br>4. Integrated RGB backlight keyboards. This would bring in way more customers. Youth and gamers.<br>--PS, Ive gamed just fine on my 2013 Macbook Pro so Im not an elitist who says you need to drop $4k into a PC to be good. <br><br>I&#39;m running a 2013 Macbook Pro and it runs like it&#39;s brand new. So it&#39;s hard for me to justify upgrading, even if the battery only lasts 2 hours and the fan spins up like wild when coding.. but if Apple ever dropped an RGB Macbook I&#39;d buy it today.
love your videos keep the good work up
Need it badly for my computer engineering but sadly can’t afford it due to house loans and rents !! No worries though I will buy much better apple brand laptop after years of completing my engineering
I, too, can finally: watching this from my Macbook Pro 16! Feels so great!
I wish they&#39;d bring back the remote control and improve their flimsy charger.  At 100 quid they always Frey.
Love the way you covered al in an unbiased way! You rock!
just give us a numeric keypad and it would be perfect.
The fact that I own this now 😩
You did an amazing job with this review. I’ve been trying to find something detailed since this would be my first MacBook purchase. I will be using it for my crafting business since my 8 year old laptop is dying on me 😆thank you so much
I just got my 16 MBP yesterday and I absolutely love it. I was using a surface pro 6 before, and the MacBook is a huge upgrade from that. My wallet may hurt now, but I love the computer
I requested the base model 14&quot; spacegray from my boss and I&#39;m getting it this week. I&#39;ll be only using Figma, Adobe Photoshop, and Illustrator
I have a feeling i&#39;m going to get the next version of this. Possibly not, considering i don&#39;t really need a laptop and my phone can do everything i&#39;d need a laptop for.
I picked up the M1 Max 16” 32g Ram 1tb of storage.
Is there a Apple MacBook that’s touchscreen

Marquese they are apple so notch will there for next decade without faceid and without smaller shape.  Hard to say facts 😅😅
I think they should have put in Face ID even though there isn&#39;t really a big reason too they had the notch so u should just include the Face ID and that might be more appealing since I have not heard of major laptop brands incorporating Face Recognition into their newest laptops.
This guy is so good 👍. One less dongle
The M1 Chips Are Great!
getting the MBP Max for doing Sudoku puzzles
No personal dig at you mate, but these kind of videos is why I am currently so mad about my decision to purchase M1 Max. It is slower than expected. No word of a lie, even transferring files from SSD, HDD, backing up to cloud etc get slower than expected. What recently shocked me is the lagging performance on a 2 min video in Davinci Resolve - only have a handful of transitions, generators, titles, etc yet it struggles???? The spec I have is decent at 32GB unified, 10 Core CPU 24 GPU, 1TB M1 Pro Max (Not just Pro). I have initiated a return with Apple, as it makes me so sad to have spent 3,000 bucks on something that performs like my 2012 MBP :( <br><br>The only explanation I can think of is that I was sent a defective one. I doubt it, but it is possible considering how everyone who have churned out videos talking about M1 Max being able to take pretty much anything you throw at it
Great review.....I model in 3D and render 3d animations and stills.....having a render engine using the GPU on the M1 Max will be interesting.  Thanks, great review
I actually liked type C better than the magnetic connector. Earlier MacBook Pro chargers gave me hard time replacing them

Is macbook pro a good option as a computer engineer student?
The panels are not 10 bit

Apple realised they did something good, oh no, they have to ruin the next one.

“The smallest machine” he could take with him … packed into the largest protective box he could find
These M-Line Macs are like Chromebooks. You can only browse web, watch movies or use Apple Produced software as you would be able to in Chromebooks. Intel Macs were suitable for programming purposes. These new M-Line Macs are piece of shit from a programmer&#39;s perspective. Anything you can&#39;t run Linux on properly is piece of shit. Long story short, I don&#39;t want to pay huge sums for an advanced Chromebook.



bruh for over 3k I want more then just &quot;good in a pinch&quot; and &quot;one less dongle&quot;
revolutionary added ports. another apple genius industry improvement
Nice
Makes me feel buying new MacBook M1 Air as cheap.

Everyone needs performance after 6 months of using the machine.

Brother I’m still using a Panasonic ToughBook Police Laptop I bought refurbished. Runs the latest Windows at lightning slow speed. <br><br>I’m lucky I can run Hulu/Netflix and can play QWOP. That’s about it.
Hi , I bought a refurbished MacBook 16 inch 2021.  Its M1 32 ram. On website it says 200 memory bandwidth, but all the specs comes only with 400 memory bandwidth. How could i check if it is 200 or 400 plz?  Btw Apple cant check 😂. <br>Or what program should I use to show me the memory bandwidth on my MacBook plz?

Who the hell dislikes this dudes videos?

Thank you brother, that was a really great review.
marques is so tall that even the macbook pro 16 really matches to him
I have a mid-2015 that I&#39;m generally happy with, but it is feeling old. I&#39;ve just decided to become a digital nomad and therefore am trying to get rid of my physically big things like my iMac. I&#39;m thinking of trading it in for a significant loss and upgrading the laptop. I hope it&#39;s a good choice.

Dang. This was a great review in simple English. Thanks for including the Final Cut Pro section. Thanks again!
Fstopers does best reviews… nobody cares about the notch and we know its fast…but its the technicalities that we care about and ease of use

I’ve been saving for this laptop for months. I hope to be able to get it this summer. I can’t wait to use a laptop without needing 3 adapters. My 2019 Macbook with the i5 isn’t doing it for me anymore. 😂
I got to get me one. Oh yes, I will get me one.
I just left a early 2015 MBP did music prediction, and went to entry 14inch mbp m1 pro and man what a great machine
Sadly I think I’ll have to upgrade this year from my maxed out Mid 2015 15” MacBook Pro. Starting to notice lag issues.
o  me  god  me  love  sister  i  love  you  and  respect  you  hahaha:))
😭😭 the ports alone make me wanna open my wallet
Bring back DVD drive

Amazing laptop, but that notch is a bit upsetting
I think its time to switch from my surface to a MB Pro

Great stuff. Is there a Mac mini pro?
If this is M1 Max, I&#39;m scared about what the M2 will be capable of...
imagine upgrading a MacBook based on this guys reviews...this is why he is getting paid
Guys!! The intro is actual surround/spatial sound!!!
bruh why didn&#39;t they add a normal fucking usb
@marques (or if anyone else can answer this question) - Does the headphone jack support Stereo Line-In as it did previously to mid 2015? My last mid-2012 MBP had the ability to use &quot;Line-In&quot; for a stereo input to record a stereo source. I am testing a Macbook Air 2020 M1, and the Line-In does not exist on this model. I wonder if it is any different for the more expensive Macbook Pro?
Like Linus.
I can ducking hear his lips chirping I’m every video dude lower the mic sensitivity
machine-told: macintosh
Apple products are like Toyota vehicles if they cost 5x the price

Can I play GTA on this laptop?

me: <b>buys this just so I can feel like a person from corporate</b>
Does anyone else find this keyboard really LOUD?!?
Thank you for always being such a detailed and interesting reviewer! I feel a lot more confident about my purchases after watching your reviews.
I work in a machine shop and use my 2019 MacBook Pro 16 in that environment every day. I do my best to mitigate small metal shavings from finding their way to and in my laptop with a custom laptop stand I roll around the shop from machine to machine. My question is, does the mag safe cable contain the magnets to mount the cable or are the on the laptop? It&#39;s hard enough to keep the speakers from collecting metal particles that float in the air from collecting on the laptop, I don&#39;t need a port on the side of the computer collecting them either.
I just want the massive storage options without an external drive. Yes, I do use a ton of storage.
🖕🖕🖕 he&#39;s fast and reliable
I already have the 2020 macbook pro m1 with 500gb of space and 16gb of rams but im just getting tired of charging it so idk if to buy the mac studio max configurations with the studio display. Cause like im just getting tired and i don’t feel confortable using it while it charges. Like idk. 😢
Yes it is truly next level both I  performance and price.


I’m a consumer living in the age of technological advancements. Do you I really need all that performance no, but am I able to acquire it Yes!🤑
Consistently the best tech commentator out there!

I&#39;ll give credit where credits due.  Gratz to the PC mac industry on overhyping shit people don&#39;t need at all.  People on here are talking about doing awesome work on the airplane ride.  Like you needed a Macbook since, you couldn&#39;t budget enough work time to avoid working while you were sitting on the plane?...Lump this in with new phones, that don&#39;t really do jack shit for you.  But don&#39;t worry, texting, the lowest form of data transfer on the planet is free...I hear...Bottom line?  People are dumb and have no clue what they &quot;need&quot;.  But its shiny and new..spend spend.
But can you play steam games on it? And why does it have to be so expensive, it should only cost like $600. In fact apple should give me a new one since they destroyed my 2011 MacBook Pro by giving me it with a defective graphics card. They should also buy give me $2,000 for purposely slowing down my iPhone and also my iPad

What if there was a laptop that just had like 25 ports, and even a lightning port for using lightning headphones
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m54s">0:54</a> or you could use literally any gaming laptop that costs as low as $500

I just got this laptop through my job after my previous MacBook 2018 failed on me. I’m really loving the new design even though I was a bit thrown off by how much thicker it is. Looking forward to enjoying my experience with it more :)
badly need one 16 inch 😔
&quot;convience in a pinch&quot; maybe Apple should have just kept the port instead of condition us to wait this long. Great review as always :)

wow

Great review sir!

Feels like going back to 2015... I mean this as a very high compliment.

Anybody know why Apple does not offer 64GB RAM on M1 Pro?


I recently bought the 14 inch and I have no regrets, I do not miss windows at all it makes my life so easy and efficient accross my M1 iMac as well iPad mini and iphone.
yay no ridiculous touch bar and dongles

Black Linus even whines for the same reasons

&lt;3

Way too expencive. Thats what happens when there is no competition.
Imagine buying that crap. The most expensive laptop in the world and you don&#39;t even get decent ports. I guess its fine for people who edit photos..

The crow &quot;kaww&quot; in the intro 😭
cant play games, pass

Great product and better review!
I’d like to know applications we need to download about MacBook Pro please?
This video is almost funny now that the Mac Studio has been released.
Every time I watch one of your vids, I just want to be your best friend
@Marques Brownlee / @here<br><br>Have never used a laptop as my main machine for work, always used something bigger that requires to be plugged in all the time (Mac pro/iMac)<br><br>My question is, has anyone experienced problems leaving a Macbook pro plugged in permanently (With occasional disconnects for meetings etc) - - (90% plugged in)<br><br>Does the battery get damaged or weaker if the power was left in permanently?<br><br>Trying to decide between this and the new Mac Studio<br><br>Let me know :) 🙏🏽

Thank you for the review<br>I don’t think I’ll get a reply but I wonder which one will do photoshop and Lightroom running smoothly without getting stuck (not responding) like my Dell laptop what I want to throw out the window every time I have to work with it !! <br>The M1 max is nice but price is quite expensive.. please help
How fast does it render, simulate, train ai, compile? Almost half an hour long video yet all i get is video editing. Like come on, many people are involved in more serious stuff than video editing.
Please dont retire the travel iMac.

thanks for the inf
Only wear socks and sandals for a day?  Dude I say wager for a month.
Bais opinion. This guy is paid to tell you products.
Great video! Would love to see you review or do a comparison with the competitors (specifically high end laptops for 2D/3D graphics and video) such as the new Gigabyte Aero.
Hoping to get my hand on it one day by God&#39;s grace
I got the m1 pro since I could definitely use all the cpu power but I don’t need the gpu stuff.


Macbook m1 max is just for Entertainment, Content Creator, Video editing, It&#39;s none for Architect, 3D ARTIST, 3D MODELLING, for example 3d Max, Autocad, Maya, BLENDER ect. It is not worth and work for me an Architect. Apple Silicon is not working for Professional Software....

Nice jobs,thanks share

All of the M1 chip variants are absolute beasts!

If Mac M1&#39;s have such an amazing processor, why does it feel so slow compared to Windows?

...&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus&quot;😝😹 &quot;3 minutes and 49 seconds, Jesus&quot; 😆😹
I am writing this comment through MacBook Pro 16 inch M1 max. Lovely device 😀

The womanly jasmine cranially charge because detective rhetorically perform toward a premium calculator. tremendous, alleged modem

The only laptop i know thanks for elaborating coolest features on it @M.B

Coolest features, magnetic things most interesting, it&#39;s powerful enough to be substituted.

Bruh I can’t wait to get mine I go to full sail and we get them free

This laptop is insanely fast!!!

CAN anyone quickly comment on which Mac Computer would WORK BEST for a PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER?🙋‍♂️✔️

put those fkn hands away from the screen,  your videos are always 90% about your hands
I LOVE editing with my Touch Bar!!! But no one else seems to miss it? 😢
The best video on YouTube on the MacBook Pro. You made my decision easier. My very old HP just died so it’s time to get an Apple product to go with my iPhone.
Watching as I inbox my new 16 in
Extremely Outstanding, Professional &amp; Perfect M1 Max MacBook Pro Review Video by you Sir. Marques, You Are Truly in a Class by Yourself. Truly a Master Class of Perfection! 😝😝👻👻👽

Extremely cool jordans
Jesus loves you!!!!
I hate it when people complain about the notch I’ve never noticed it on my phone
IS there UHS III (3) sd cards available on market? Can anyone explain the available camera models and cards?
I never had a MacBook and hopefully will get my 16 inch today. I am not a pro at what you were talking about at all. I just want to edit my photos and check mainly check my emails and watch stuff like this. The computer I have now is a pc with alot of issues. Hopefully the Macbook will make things better. I did not understand a word you were talking about all the data but I guess I need to understand it. Peace.

I ordered a 14inch M1 max 10/24, very excited, 16 just wasn’t for me, but I like the 14 size and when I do a lot of my work I’m connected to a dock so battery wasn’t a limiting factor for me.

I was holding on to my MacBook Pro Mid-2015 Retina waiting for this. Got my 14&quot; today and love it.

how does it compare with iPhone 12 mini ?

The notch on a MacBook is so not it. Pisses me off

i have being receiving alot of stuff with the help from amazon store

I just upgraded to the 2016 pro from the non retina 2011 pro and this laptop reminds me of my old laptop. In terms of feel and looks; its like they went back in time. Disappointed that one day I will have to go back to this chunky looking box from the luxury slap that the 2016 is.

768GB of RAM you said? Wow!

im very impressed  by  the new m1 chips as a huge NERD. But at some point apple will stand in its own way with its exclusiveness making it very hard for people to program stuff that  can use all of this performance (at that ridiculous energy efficiency). so much wasted potential. which drives me mad. :(

That intro was so sick!

Waiting for your next review video on MAC studio(M1 Ultra)

Honestly my dude, why would you ever bother moving an IMAC around like that when you can just remote back to the IMAC/PC and save yourself quite a lot of trouble. I do this myself extensively, LTE/5G hotspot + ultrabook is definitely superior to having to mess with all that stuff.

RULE 1<br>To be a legitimate MAC BOOK PRO user you need to be a professional.

Fascinating work ☺️

What Is the use of this power?

My new job just sent me this MBP M1 Max. Get it tomorrow. Was bummed at first but now I&#39;m excited.

back to 2016

Why is the SSD SOLDERED on the damn Motherboard ??!?!?! Whyyy ? If that *ish breaks , apple gon replace the whole motherboard , charging us consumers almost full price for the damn repair ? They must’ve lost their mind bruh . Us customers need to teach these guys a lesson , like really quick. I’m out this bish . I’m switching to windows laptop . 1tb ssd on windows costs 109$ on amazon and 2tb costs roughly 109$ x 2 . Check the same spec bumps on the Demonic Apple website 😃🤗 . 1tb ———&gt; 2tb is +400$ and can t even replace the damn thing. Take care y’all 🙏🏻

Still can’t believe that you took an iMac on a business trip.
need to get me a macbook

Thanks for your imformatioms
Watching this on my new Macbook Pro 14
This is amazing video with a lot of great helpful works very you.
Just got my M1 MacBook Pro 14 that I ordered with a 1TB SSD. Love this computer. It’s ridiculously good.
The Mac Pro is $5000 not $50000
I have them both !! The M1 16&#39;&#39; is a beast !!

❤

And now you can travel with a mini studio! Those things look amazingly fast. Looking forward to seeing that review pop up.
The new Macs honestly look incredible.

this the music from the Logan Paul Japan vlog?
Excellent review. Probably the best I have seen to date.
Have not had a working laptop in 7 years when my 2007 macbook pro went down, im ready to jump back in with this one. I definitely feel like the power will suit me, i always edited footage, used ableton live while using tons of plug ins, serato for dj sets, recording live bands and running musical instruments/midi pads through ableton live and other software.
Informative// love from Sudan 🇸🇩
What&#39;s the intro music called?
lol
does anyone know which desk is in the intro at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a>? ty
Trust me.. these would be the best for development work... I have some gigantic code running and debugging in an older intel version... Can&#39;t stop imagining running those on this chip..
Top notch lol

Imagine how bumped out those who worked super hard to buy the MacPros only to have them… obsolete especially in value in ridiculous periods of time. I used to have the MacPros from its G4 form factor to the Xeons and those lasted way, way, way longer in relevance than these newer ones. It seems the tagline of today’s MacPros is Cost 50x More, Irrelevant in Much Less Time.
Damn, time to interview at Apple, I guess. &lt;3
saw one in person. not sure i like the new outer case form. would really like a matte screen on it.
Loved the video! Just got mine and I’m ready to work! 🙏🏾

Yet for the vast amount of people a 300 quid Chrome Book is more than good enough . Great to see the really high end stuff though.
I wish that I had one.

hmm i think its too costly

Agree on the ports where they could be better.
I&#39;m finally upgrading my 2015 MBP

It is not perfect, but with better performance and better autonomy. I buy it !

I enjoy watching people review expensive things, while I have 3 dollars to my name.
This has not been my experience. I&#39;ve had mine a year and it isn&#39;t all that earth shattering. In fact, I have significant screen glitchiness.  Maybe it&#39;s because I have the 8g model.  Not sure, but I feel it&#39;s overrated.


Nice to meet you !!!
Avoid the M1 like the plague.  Apple is becoming the new Windows. Bloatware.  Ridiculous setup problems, like during initial setup I chose “new Apple ID” and got message “this machine has been used to set up too many Apple ids.  What?  It’s a brand new machine.  Straight from Apple.  Ok, then it’s tech support,hold with someone who I can barely understand.   Then it’s “commCenter wants to use your keychain”  huh?  Password entered, and it’s the same message.   Then it’s “sharingd wants to use your login”.   And numerous similar messages.   No thanks Apple.   If I’m paying 4x the price of a windows machine then it better “simply work” - not give me codes and hassles like windows 95.
I&#39;ve rub Windows 11 via parallels on this thing. You would never know it was running on a vm. It&#39;s pretty impressive.
I legitimately bought the 16 inch MacBook pro with the M1 Max, 64gb of ram, and a 4tb ssd, just to end up using Windows 11 via parallels most of the time. I am not an Apple guy, but this... this is a good computer. I almost never have to charge this thing. It&#39;s light. It&#39;s sleek. It&#39;s sexy. It&#39;s git some great ports, and it&#39;s got one hell of a screen. Build quality is next gen, and something that other companies need to take note of.


You’re a real pro at these.  Nice work man…
I just gone mine! Keyboard cover or no? I keep hearing they can cause issues with cracked displays.
Amazing review and definitely getting one of the 14&quot; M1 Pro Max. <br><br>Check your external monitor needs before you choose your version!<br><br>I don&#39;t do a lot of video editing but I do use a workstation with either dual (or more) monitors and I&#39;ve been experimenting with the larger curved monitors at the higher 220hz refresh rate. I nearly purchased a 13&quot; M1 but thankfully someone pointed out that the M1 (on the laptop) only supports one external display. I did a little digging and:<br><br>M1 - 1 External display<br>M1 Pro - 2 External displays<br>M1 Pro Max - up to 4 external displays<br><br>That was a game changer for me.
I started as an amateur audiophile years ago when I found this channel. I was probably in middle/highscool school and I&#39;m 24 now. That headphone jack brought me some old school excitement even though I&#39;m completely happy with my airpods/ATH M50s
I want one but don’t need it. Lol
If I would consider buying an apple laptop, it would be because if the M1 chip. I&#39;m not a big fan of apple&#39;s product because of compatibility issues. But I think I can set aside that now because of M1.. It&#39;s not only the superior chip of any laptop right now but it&#39;s also so promising that maybe in the future, intel will have to change their cpu design architecture from x86 and x64 into ARM..
Bro u got a Samsung 👀

What do you do with the sharp palm cutting bottom edge? It is still there even in 2022 sold models.  Using an external keyboard and mouse is one solution, but is there any better way to protect the palm?
I&#39;ve used 250ohm&#39;s DT770 pro&#39;s on my previous gen macbook pro, and if anyone think that they can&#39;t push enough volume then their ears are destroyed.
Inches don&#39;t matter but performance does ;)
I wish, one day I will respond to this comment using a Macbook Pro !
I hate that the keyboard is inset in this black. I wish it was sliver
Do anybody had a laptop that from all the opening and closing that it breaks away from the hinges and or the bottom frame ( monitor) parts away from the bottom
Cant wait for Marques to wear socks and sandals for a day.
I love your reviews man! you&#39;re great, thank you!
Nice Review. Anyone ever tell you, you look like big daddy kane?
&quot;A new top-notch design&quot;... I see what you did there! 😉
I really like the older macbook look, the one that macbook air still is. I hope they&#39;re only doing it to fit in more hardware or something for the spec.

Damn! Mkbhd is the gold standard for content on youtube.

now i don&#39;t edit or anything but i just ordered it for school . what do ya think a waste of money just for school ?


nice
thanks
Missed opportunity to call it the M1 Macbook Pro Max
Who is that dumbass engineer that keep making these stupid notches on apple products?? I don&#39;t care how much revolutionnary technology you jam in there it&#39;s just UGLY!!!!!!!! smh
I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus. xD
I&#39;ve been using a late 2011 MBP to do music production with Native Instruments Maschine and Pro Tools. I&#39;ve upgraded the system to 16 GB of memory and a Samsung 1TB SSD. I&#39;ve gotten 11 years out of this baby. But it might be time to move to the 16 inch M1 Max MBP and Logic.
Drop the word &quot;actually&quot; from your vocabulary.  It&#39;s never needed, really.
What&#39;s the video editor that you used to judge the performance?
Does anybody know whats wrong with apple?<br>I did order and fully paid a 16&quot; MacbookPro M1 Max with mactrade which is a Germany based apple provider on October 22 in 2021 and still waiting.<br>They telling me week by week that apple won&#39;t deliver my order. Whats wrong with apple?

No more big suitcase 🧳 😂😂🤣
The apple logo really ruined that 3d camera track at the beginning
although this might be a media machine ( i just bought the 14 pro M1), it will NOT handle CAD at all !! you ask, why use CAD on a MacBook? i say because my intel MacBook did and everything pointed to this being faster--- well its only faster IF you dont use it for the hard stuff. I will not be selling it as its faster in the daily grind, but very disturbing that i have to go use my 2015 intel based MacBook to do any CAD work that pays the bills.


As I die hard PC/android user, I&#39;m interested 🤔

Hahaha &quot;top notch design&quot;

I&#39;ve been using an M1 Pro MBP 16&quot; for nearly a month... and wow. A significant upgrade form my last MacBook Pro. Really loving everything about it!

When I was in college, I had a MacBook Pro that I used to get all my work done. I still miss that thing! I think these NEW mac Books would be  a great replacement for that old MacBook from the 2000&#39;s. If only I could afford that right now!
The notch is acceptable on the 16 inch, on the 14 inch it&#39;s too distracting.

i was checking this on the apple website which 8 tb and 64 gb ram which was like 6 thousand dollars. Thats crazy

The guy shows everything very cool!&quot;12
Setting up my new mbp. Got plenty of time since I forgot my USB-c and now I’m stuck with wifi to transfer my old mbp to new one🤦‍♂️

I&#39;m sorry.. Your Mac Pro has 768GB of ram?!

In the &#39;Let&#39;s Talk Ports&#39; part of the video you said the UHS2 is 300 Megabytes/s. When it comes to transferring speed of data isn&#39;t the unit Mbit/s rather than Mb/s??

Where can I find a a real time audio performance benchmark?
My favourite thing is to go to the trade in option and when I select a manufacturer other than Apple it offers to recycle my laptop for free. Can you believe that? FREE OF CHARGE! 😂 Can you imagine sending a 4000$ Windows laptop for fun 😆
Did you have any issues with Logitech&#39;s webcam with the M1 device?
pls where can I get that groot figure in the left corner behind you?
Get ready to wear socks and sandals ✌🏻✌🏻🤣🤣
Wish they do the same revolution for ipados
Overpriced garbage like all apple stuff.

such an apple fan boy
Top-Notch design made me laugh 😁
I would love to get a macbook air, but the lack of ports annoys me.

$50k computer!

I still can’t believe there’s not HDMI 2.1 support. Even if you get a USB C dongle to HDMI 2.1 apparently macOS still limits it to 4K 60. Like seriously Apple you have a 120 hz display in the MacBook Pro and you can’t even give us a 2.1 port nor support at all for it!? Pretty sad on a $3000+ machine
Hi.. Kindly review Fujitsu UHX laptop for reviews.
this made me regret hard buying my windows laptop some years ago
Super helpful review! I&#39;ve been using a late 2013 macbook pro, but I think it&#39;s time to upgrade and retire my old laptop.

Space Grey Touch Bar Gang Where You At
I honestly prefer the MacBook Pro 13 inch. It is what I am using to write this.

SD card port doesn&#39;t work. Anyone else have this problem?

57 billion transistors. I realize now its limitation is the CPU with only 10 cores. You got other chips out there with 128 cores but yeah a giant heat sink. I can only imagine the apple silicon iMac Pro is gonna be like 32 core cpu 128 core gpu in excess of 100 billion transistors and about as thin as the M1 iMac which is 11.5 mm lmao. Can’t believe Apple hate is still going on

Why it looks so awful and not so Appleish 😭😭😭😭
I saw someone in my geography with this laptop today. I was like that&#39;s a nice laptop what do you use it for, his response, youtube, netflix amazon and maybe the odd word document. I was so confused why he bought this laptop for
Next level to do what? To watch YouTube? 😂
I just bought mine and it will be here before my birthday in March. I use Photoshop and do design work for my job and in my leisure time.  I can&#39;t wait to play around with it!!

Where is that groot from !!

Bru marques using a hien
Great video, love this guy, he is so legit. I am currently trying to decide on ditching my android eco system to try apple but still very confused in the sense that if learn IOS will it deter me from using windows platforms at work? it seems hard enough to learn one type of OS let alone two. And then there is the complex challenge of getting rid of my current laptops and buying the MacBook, or MacBook air like were do I start? what d I need, is there a video on switching to Apple for dummy&#39;s?
Are you able to upload YouTube and edit on this? Add your final cuts, end-screens, music  &amp; such on the laptop? Right now I use iPad and my final upload has to be finished on my desktop. I’d like to do all in one.

Is AutoCAD supported on these yet?

anyone able to play MIR4 here with M1 ? Im using mac for work but also want to play at the same time, any users here?

<del>me who just wants to play roblox and zoom for class</del> <br><br>I NEED IT

please bring the Touch Bar back. I used it all the time. or just give us a choice.  I think they only heard a bunch of YouTubers complain and felt everyone felt that way.
<b>Apple removes ports</b> - &#39;nobodys using those anymore anyway&#39;<br><b>Apple adds them again</b> - &#39;omg so glad Apple brought these back&#39; <br><br>Sums up what happens to any Apple product. They just play around with ports, size and shape and people buy and worship them no matter what
I would really like to see someone do a price to performance comparison.
I already got the Air 4 and to be honest it’s more than I need as I’m just an average user, but I just ordered the pro 12.9” to have for the next few yrs, for me it’ll hold up better over time far as the features it has heck even the Air has features I don’t use currently but over time might come in handy, another reason I got one is I just lost my dad whim I stayed with the past 10 yrs so I was able to have plenty extra money but come next month I’ll have to start paying rent on my on and won’t have extra cash so I bought a bunch of stuff that should last and entertain me for the next 5-7 yrs…I got a PS5, Nintendo switch lite and Oled, ASUS Laptop 💻, Apple Watch, IPhone 12, Beats 🎧 pro and Power Beats Pro, Both Apple Air4 and Pro and last 2 TVs one normal 50” and my 75” Smart TV that I love Top of the line LG model so yeah all that stuff should last me for yrs to come, I do plan on selling the Air 4 and the Switch lite as I don’t need 2 tablets and 2 switches.. enough rambling lol great video as usual
Audio software production definitely isn’t fully there yet. Still not a good choice for certain music hardware / software. Maybe later in the year.
if you happen not to use or need any of your macs feel free to contact me or just send it to me 🤪
Just curious to ask, can someone purchase any gadgets from you after reviews.
So no usb ports? My gaming laptop has a mouse, a keyboard and a charger plugged in right now. Ummm so adapters needed? I don&#39;t get it
cant use m1 macs with microsoft access.
I just love the intro, especially the music. It&#39;s stuck in my head
Face ID would justify that notch size but since it doesn’t have Face ID the notch should have been half that size or less..
after all my 9 year old macbook is better cuz yes theres actually a power button.
What about a &quot;matte black everything&quot; tracksuit? Id buy that and it would probably be the best seller
Seeing that you have a Pixel 6 Pro. Can I ask, what&#39;s the best way of getting files (videos/photos) from the phone onto a Mac. I&#39;ve tried a few different programs and they&#39;re all a bit finicky in my opinion.
SO basically, its only good for editing videos and doing shit most people don&#39;t do
Congrats Ojha!
Wow dude, don&#39;t stack those macbooks on top of eachother, it will scratch them. Watching you putting the one on top of the other and moving it a bit, caused a brain error.
can you game on 8K ???
day by day you seems fan boy then a tech genius
may travel with imac fan boy.. get good laptop from asus :)
Lora next level. not even near my years old PC bullshit
Still feel screwed by the inability to run VM&#39;s if they were x86 chipset based.   I now have a very expensive very powerful brick.
<b>INTRO: &quot;Next Level&quot; by Aespa starts playing</b>
I am Groot
its all about the single core speed.
The editing on that intro is just so good omg
My man doesn&#39;t know laptops 😂😂😂😂😂, &quot;travel imac&quot;<br>That shit was hilarious
&quot;Only 64GB of ram&quot; and here I am with 32GB ram feeling like Ima set the world on fire with it xD And then you go on saying something about your Mac Pro having 768GB of ram like holy freakin cow. I mean thats stupid crazy!! Thats almost as much as my 1TB PCIe SSD I got inside this laptop xD
We saw your studio. Now we need a home tour of MKBHD...
What if I’m just working and watching videos what mac should I get

why do you justify the notch like not noticeable or fast to get used to it and no the same thing with non apple products? kinda funny
the key phrase is &quot;in a pinch &quot; when taking about ports
Telling my parents this is the cheapest apple laptop because I’m too ashamed that I’ve just spend £2699 on this. 😂😂
My job is to do Wordle daily....
Man you are really good at reviewing!
Consumer tech has alienated most people in pursuits of global market domination but offers lower priced, lower functionality products to maintain loyalty in the hopes that one day that individual will pour money into arbitrarily and redundantly upgraded tech that is still self stymied as to not lose out on profits because their product is too good for people to never buy another. Companies like apple will crumble rapidly as a result of their own competitiveness and pushing of unwarranted services on consumers. What will pushback look like when people realize even if they’re content with a device or device they already bought, that companies will indirectly find ways to force the redundancy of their own devices to sell more year over year? The capabilities only match the capabilities of the individual, or system of individuals. Ignorance and arrogance reign supreme in this post modern world. The optimists are now the idiots and the self proclaimed righteous turned out to be the most heavily corrupt. China is going to make fools out of a large chunk of people who have played along with their games the past 30+ years, pushing for the development of tech through their means of production and cheap Human Resources, then stealing and producing for themselves, the very technologies we developed to earn ridiculous profits. China did it to take over the world. Someone or many people originally sold out to China and it would take a literal army to expose that fact and fill in the void that has been circled for decades now, proving a clear outline around I’ll content. Apple- the insularly empire.

This last year has been crazy for macs.<br>macbook air m1<br>imac m1<br>macbook pro 14/16 m1 pro/max<br><br>each one outdoing the last.
Love this video bro.
The notch is pleasing for the eyes. Spece Odyssey 2000
I bought a MBP 16 10/32/64 1tb and right out the box after any sound plays the left speaker gives static. Has this happened to anyone else?
The problem with face ID on the notch is the thickness of the screen<br>iPhone is thick enough for face ID sensors but MacBook pro&#39;s screen isn&#39;t
Anybody know when the M2 is being released? I heard in the first half of 2022, but also heard in the second half of 2022. <br><br>Any info is appreciated.  I&#39;m trying to choose which Mac I want. I want it for making beats and editing videos, so it would be nice to have one sooner.
Wow next liver tech ❤️
Apple will sell another 50 Million next year without the notch. That&#39;s Apple.
Still cant use my usb devices on the mac.
is the keyboard really better than the Touch Bar?
So the bottom line is… less dongles
I AM GROOT!
Yes now this is a MacBook. I still use the 2015 Mac and with this 2021 model, I feel Apple is back home. 👌
God this is so apple
Well it’s a better workmachine i guess.<br>What we wanted I guess.
Yes exactly. They went back 4 years.<br>The design is 4 years old. How can that be good. I mean no dongels. But does it need to be that thick to fit an HDMI slot?
I love how excited he was in this video. He was trying so hard to hold back
OMG it has ports lol!!!!!!
Can&#39;t believe this has no ethernet in the power brick.  So you still need a dongle to wire it up to a network which is something many pros wound have to do. <br><br>More Mac Middle of the road than Mac Pro but not too bad just defeats the purpose of the other ports if you need to use an external dongle anyway
Apple needs to come out with a touch display for macbooks

You think pc will follow suit?

My god, that intro

The fact that you were able to edit 8k video sold me on upgrading from my 16” 2019 intel MBP I will only be editing 4k in premiere so it’s worth buying &amp; getting that trade in credit

My uncle got one from his work and it is amazingly fast. And it saves him so much time

can someone tell me how to fully turn off this kind of MacBook pro model cause everytime I turned it off, it will eventually turn right back on again right after I open the lid / press any button on the keyboard! It drives me crazy especially every time I try to CLEAN IT!

I only have a chrome book

Bro , stop lieing,  you have people to do your edits by now , not yourself

&quot;only 64gb ram&quot; wow
Can anyone tell me if they&#39;re get these annoying little pop up ads at the bottom of every YouTube video on their MacBook?.. Not sure if its normal or not and they&#39;re really irritating me! I don&#39;t mean the normal YouTube ads you get when monetising your video.. These ads kind of just pop up throughout the video playing at he bottom of the video in the middle and im not sure if it&#39;s a virus or not. Any info would be much appreciated.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m25s">16:25</a> &quot;Only has 64 gigs of RAM&quot;
why doesn&#39;t ur editor know when to cut..
Hope by next you dont even have to carry a laptop for your edits. Your pocket will have all that power

Gonna buy one

i think this might be the ugliest product apple has made in a while tbh, other than their headphones lol
Nooo!<br>Not socks and sandals
ARE YOU STILL THERE DOUBTING AND WATCH WHILE OTHERS ARE MAKING COOL MONEY FROM BITCOIN INVESTMENT, I WILL ENCOURAGE YOU TO START INVESTING TO SECURE A BETTER FINANCIAL...... FREEDOM























I’m gonna buy this next week I just really don’t know if I should get the 14” or 16”… why can’t they have made a 15” one that would be perfect 😂
Please what&#39;s the cost in the USA?
Right i can only touch these in my dreams
well, gotta work for 2 years in order to buy that.
Genuinely surprised this guy edits his own videos. I&#39;m pretty sure he can afford a $250k/yr professional video editor and free up several hours per day to go enjoy life


Just bought the maxed out 16&quot;. I don&#39;t make videos, edit photos, play games, or anything like that, I just wanted something as future proof as possible. Hoping for another 10 years like my last MBP.
hey guys I am really requesting u guys to help me... coz I really need a laptop for college...Andrew, Vinh, Hayato, Tim, David or Adam or the famous Marques brownlee..... just atleast reply to my comment common guys!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Look honestly I am losing all the hopes guys.. pls Help!
The guy makes $900K after all expenses from his videos, ads, etc. you know I&#39;m going to trust what he says.
The notch seriously has no place on a laptop. There are many laptops out there with bezels as thin as this without needing to resort to a notch. This just creates the unnecessary association between notches and thin bezels in the consumer&#39;s mind.
Macbook M1 Max (max specs:32cpu,64GB etc) Vs iMac 2019 (3,7 GHz 6-Core i5,64GB,Radeon Pro 580X 8 GB).  I did a test on a 10 minutes &quot;complicated&quot; HD project \ the same library on internal SDD&#39;s. The results of render time were M1 Max 6min6sec... and on iMac 10min21sec. Playback was a little better on M1. (they both struggle playback on the same spot of multi-effects combination on a clip...in that point iMac stuck on render for 2-3 minutes).  I create the library on my MacBook so when I copy it on intel iMac then I noticed that some plug-ins (from Pixel Film Studio and some more) were &quot;missing&quot; - so I replaced them with exactly the same ones from the iMac folders. I didn&#39;t notice a crazy difference in the performance, to be honest... What if I had the iMac i7 or i9? Did any other user have any other performance experience between their new M1 MacBooks and their older systems (2017+)? I had high expectations or did I do something wrong? And last... has to do with 3rd party plugins to slow down that kind of system?
iPad: iPad<br>iPad with larger screen: iMac<br>iPad with keyboard: MacBook Pro<br>iPad without screen: Mac Mini<br>hotel: trivago
Im a gamer, but il do all my gaming on my desktop and my Series X.<br><br>I use laptop for media, video and photo editing, school and surfing. And in 2014 i bought my macbook pro 13 inch with 8gb ram. Until this day it have worked so good, and still rocks. Recently I decided to upgrade and went with the 14 inch m1 pro 10 core cpu and 16 core GPU with 1tb and i have to say it just feels awesome. These computers are reliable, gorgeous and awesome for what they are ment for. <br><br>So all in all i recommend it, if you have the money and need the upgrade, go for it!
Is this video sponsored?

great job!!!!!
ok but does it still get the keyboard imprinted on the screen
i kinda like the notch lol
The notch is hideous. I can&#39;t deal with it.  Otherwise it is a 10/10 laptop. I actually love the touchbar and enjoy my 2020 macbook pro fine.
Any favor with a MacBook Pro gift?<br>I really love Apple products
768GB of RAM?!
Truly Next Level Intro!!!
If I could actually find one to buy!!!!!
👍
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥MK bringing it
Why Apple don’t design gaming laptop? I believe that market section also worth billions.
New camera deserved some analysis.
768GB of RAM, that&#39;s way more storage than my SSD :D
where are the specs? bad review
Holy Mother of Jesus. One laptop to rule<br>them all.
Looks like Groot is digging the new mac as well
Previous Macs had lot of memory leak issues, and I dont think this will be any better as the OS still remains the same. Also its not only about having a laptop for video editing. It seems that Apple knows this part and is in general focusing mostly in that segment. Not focusing on increasing the apps that are compatible with it , the apps that are mostly used in the Engineering industries are not compatible much. Also Apple knows that companies dont want to pay a premium on one laptop just to get a MAC. So basically thats why Mac is still mostly a household laptop with a premium tag. <br>About memory, I dont know how its managed much, but have seen that a 64GB RAM Mac ends up using almost 90% of it while running servers which a windows 32GB machine handles easily. So other than video editing, I am not sure what else is so good about it.
What is the name of the song in the intro to this video?
He probably edited this video on the device he reviewed that’s insane!
Excellent review. Thanks for breaking things down so honestly and clearly. I&#39;m on the 2019 16&quot; MacBook Pro and the battery life when doing editing video or photos is terrible. It&#39;s a beautiful machine, but not a good mobile workstation.The portability, battery life and performance of the M1 Pro and Max chips seems like an incredible upgrade.
just ordered the 16&quot;Max Pro with 64GB Unified RAM. Damn expensive though :)
Never heard the fans?! Meanwhile my Surfacebook sounds like its taking off for flight...
All thanks to him 👆👆...for unlocking my macbook remotely 💯✔<br>continue doing your good job sir

next year M2 17 inch take ur money
Hey Marques I enjoy your content a lot but I would recommend a video on gallium nitride chargers. They’re much more efficient than silicon, so gallium nitride chargers can be extremely compact. I’m talking a 30w charger being barely bigger than a 5w.
As someone who stated editing in 1981 with 16mm film, then moved to 1” video, ¾” video, Betacam, Avid, Premiere, Final Cut Pro Studio (I was apple’s broadcast guy in Asia PAC for a couple of years working with a whole lotta big houses in the region) I have to agree with you 100%. M1 powered MBPs are the tool that finally frees content creators from a desk in a room…anywhere. I thought we had hit that point in 2004-6, but this makes all that look and feel like serious delusion. I’m running Resolve, for a whole lot of reasons, and I refuse to work with more than 4k, but lately I’ve been including more footage from a GoPro 10 in 265 “just because “. As a test, I have transcoded less of it and my DSLR footage to ProRes, which has been my workflow for almost 20 years just as a way to avoid the unavoidable space bar struggle to play thing. I decided on the 14” purely because I (usually) do my work out of a backpack roaming around South East Asia, and I can slide this into my 30L everyday pack, with cameras, lenses, lights and get on a scooter/bus/train/plane and go to the next location. I totally get what you mean about a few of the ports being not quite as bleeding edge as the could have been, but, as someone who’s dropped far more money than they should have on aluminium shells over the years, there were so often too many over specced ports that were a total waste. Case in point: Thunderbolt. Great standard, piss poor adoption by the marketplace. Apple users were never a big enough demographic for affordable devices to take advantage of it. Finally the rest of the user world has caught up and we’re getting the advantage of usability and reasonable price. So, all things considered, I’m happy as a pig in mud, and once things open up again, I’m really excited to get back on a plane and actually be able to do serious, serious content creation absolutely, unequivocally anywhere I want to lift the lid on my sweet little space grey piece of joy.


everyone of your intros are awesome i cant even express how insanely good they are keep up the good work and amazing review as usual
Lord …. That intro again…. Surpassed the m1 iPad a couple months back
Again,  the main thing that&#39;s keeping Apple alive is its software,  not hardware.  Tim Cook sucks and hasn&#39;t done anything major.  Nowhere near Steve Jobs. Just a safe CEO who cares about his pocket more than creating anything special.  These are all just incremental updates.
Truly next level in price too.. 😯
“only 64GB” only Marques
Thicker bezels are OK. Notch ISN&#39;T. You&#39;re welcome.
unpopular opinions:<br>1. magsafe kinda ugly ngl<br>2. i&#39;d much rather carry em external ports than having a thicc computer with not up-to-date ports:(
That boi look thick that’s a thick boi
My first MacBook pro unfortunately is the 2016 model.  It really puts a bad taste in my mouth.  Glad to see those ports back!

I love your intro music 🙌🏾

price????

Family bought three, cx14 and 1x16. Latter one another city family member. NONE of the Touch IDs work reliably. Despite reinstalls, several bugs were reported to Apple. Such as Safaris; Touch ID Loop of Hell, preventing logging on the bank site until using TID, then it not working, PWD, then back to logon and TID... Of course disabled AutoFill, STILL THERE&gt; Turns out we had toe full delete the print, not just Autofill. NO PROBLEMS with FIREFOX or Chrome. Torsional rigidity close to egg carton, hold it on the left side, THEY BEND mid case. YES THEY BEND even the 14&quot;. Week 2, from car to house, -15C outside but unit at 16C/59F inside my bag, froze still unresponsive for 30 min. So x3 different spec MacBook pros in the family, all with worrying issues. More important, the base 6 core FEELS SLOW. that lesser than AMD or Intel slow, or it slowed with every 5C case temp... Yes, a one trick pony optimized for specific applications only? Also, there is some silicone problem, did china force Tim to use too many SMIC garbage semis??? oh well. My unit returned...

Marques, can you sell me your iMac Pro?

I love the Touch Bar .. why would they remove it

i want a 14in so badddd

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=10m17s">10:17</a> Le&#39;ts talk about top notch design, shall we? That smile from Marques means a lot. 😄😄

I don&#39;t even want a Macbook, but I love watching your videos because they&#39;re so informative and easy to watch. Unreal.

I&#39;ve been clinging to my early 2013 Macbook Pro Retina, but at 9 years old, it&#39;s definitely showing signs of it&#39;s age. I haven&#39;t liked any of the Macbooks that have come out in recent years, but this new 2021 Macbook looks awesome!


Im enjoy full watch the content video
Nice
He got sponsored by Mac like come on bro Microsoft is best for editing or software
Go ahead and buy yours now the M2 and M2X is just around the corner!
TELL ME SOMETHING ,THE MOST  IMPORTANT QUESTION IS  HAVE YOU GIVEN YOUR LIFE TO  JESUS CHRIST THE SOURCE OF EVERYTHING. REPENT ALMIGHTY JESUS IS COMING WITH POWER
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> M1 Max*<br>Great review tho
I wish the m1 max model was named m1 pro max
Yeaaa... but the notch.. 😪
Are these good for Minecraft?
Hmm 120hz on a near 4K display 16.2 inches….hmmmmm…. Do I hear gaming in the background?
Glad you said they are tools used to get a job done. I think most people want it for the sake of having it but don&#39;t have a reason for having it. They just buy it just to have it.
768gb RAM? Was that a mistake? What world are you living in?
Had no idea it was hdmi 2.0, not as interested anymore!
did he say 768 gb of ram? I was floored I genuinely can&#39;t remember if thats the right number
I guess you could really call this &quot;Top Notch&quot; Design
Had a 2015 MBP, and just got the 16-inch MBP M1 Pro...no need for the M1 Max. Have to get used to not having USB A ports, but I am glad that I missed that no port and non-magsafe MBP phase. Now, if Apple or other suppliers could just put out some accessories for these new models....
Just got the 13 inch with the M1. it&#39;s still a powerhouse if anyone is wondering if they should save money and get the smaller one.
There wasn&#39;t a Ryzen laptop he could&#39;ve used for editing before the m1?
Does anyone have a dock recommendation for the Macbook Pro with M1 Max? Two 4k monitors, keyboard and mouse, and some things with good data transfer speeds for my external SSD?
Apple products are amazing when it comes to hardware. Seriously no one comes even close to what they are doing. The MacOS though is just too restrictive and It has two bars for whatever reason one up top with the menu bar and one at bottom to house apps, why? It takes away the real estate unnecessarily unless you are working in full-screen mode.<br>Now that Apple has made the best performing laptop, I wish they focus on improving the MacOS.

Is this the Macbook A2485?
The physical keys are beautiful, I hated the keys on the original. I missed the satisfying click and hope it does that.
Ngo I think all these non best ports are in purpose so next year they can flex that they improved. My god Apple ur is losing ideas loool. Or even the notch next year smaller notch hype. Lmao
The &quot;top-notch&quot; design statement made me chuckle because I didn&#39;t know whether you were referring to the uh...you know, that ugly notch on the top :)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m24s">12:24</a> 😂
This guy is excellent.
Top notch design 🤣👌
Please make review for HP ZBook Firefly 15.6inch G8 Mobile Workstation
every apple user in here ignoring the shortcuts apple took on a premium product that charges a premium price......NOTHING NEW HERE FOLKS! OPEN YOUR WALLET AND BEND OVER FOR STEVE JOBS
Nice and Awesome. Apple macbook pro
And USB-A charging port on the brick.
Are there any programmer that are willing to share there experience?
3000? lol
🔥🔥🔥🔥INTRO🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imagine defending the notch. What a shill.
Best review ever hands down! 🔥
6 kidneys for useless feature. A legend man that makes the world work.
&quot;I am Groot&quot;
MAGSAFE IS BACK!!! :&#39;D &lt;3
Did he just say 768Gigs of Ram at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m29s">16:29</a> Good lord what an absolute Unit of a Desktop
How many minutes was the video you rendered?
Can you use the brick from the iMac on the MacBook? To use the Ethernet connection?
Why it’s not support 2000mbps write speed of sandisk extreme pro v2
excellent review marques!
Excellent presentation and correlation of how a video show be compiled. No Uh&#39;s... Um&#39;s... Wow&#39;s... or other filler words exist in this presentation and I will definitely be returning to view future videos.
What if apple made a windows PC?🤔
What if Apple deliberately kept the notch just so that Marques wears socks and sandals like Linus?
I guess I have to get one soon, before crypto miners get a way to use this processing power for mining ...
Where can I get that baby groot plant????
my 10 year old MacBook pro will soon be saying goodbye to be replaced by his pandemic MBP baby - you&#39;ve done well my boy but time to give way to the new gen 😉
Thinking of getting the new 14&quot;, upgrading from a 2013 model macbook air that I got in 2016.<br>Hoping its going to be a massive upgrade!
Great review, thank you!
Apple: takes away standard features and tells you to buy proprietary dongles, hubs and chargers to retain your standard features.<br><br>Apple a few years later: let’s do something groundbreaking and give them ports!<br><br>Sheeple: OMG PORTS! 🤯
Saying it&#39;s fun to stick an SD card into your laptop is &quot;fun&quot; is like saying peeing standing up instead of sitting down as a man is also fun. It should be such a standard for higher creative spec laptops haha thanks for the review btw
Apple pays him more to review products.

Given the size of the notch, is there any reason why they couldn’t add face ID instead of, or alongside Touch ID?
Hated the touchbar so i&#39;m soo happy this one doesn&#39;t have it. Just bought the M1 16 inch. Love the shape, size and screen. I upgraded my mac after having my last one for 8 years (don&#39;t judge me). You have me even more excited. :)
Dude, love the review but WHERE DID YOU GET THE GROOT? 🤗
My mac air got 1728 and 7751 is that good?
You wont hear the fans bc in most use the m1 is efficient enough to work hard without cooking
glad now i can wait 5 years to buy this laptop
Finally got mine today, super impressed with it coming from a 2 year old Intel Macbook Pro
Can i work with 2 external monitors without a huge and expensive adapters
Top notch design. Like the notch at the top? Lol 😆
hehe &quot;top notch design&quot;. yeah i see that notch on the top too
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m26s">16:26</a> holy shit
bro it is the best on the market Ive got one and im happy with it!!
I wish if there was a configuration to opt out front camera, I don’t use it
a legendary Review for a legendary laptop
High impedance headphones need an AMP not a DAC
I&#39;m still really happy with my m1 macbook air.  These things are pretty crazy especially for the size and price.  I like these pro&#39;s but the air gets everything done for me :)




so apple has finally discovered ports?
&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals like Linus&quot; 😂 you just had to do him like that huh
Apple products are behind 5 years on hardware. Why tf would anyone buy this overpriced garbage
I just got the 14&quot; MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro, and First Impressions, It&#39;s awesome! a really good machine! The chip is a beast, and the speakers and camera is top-notch! (no pun intended). I only have one issue, there probably should have been a USB-A port or two on it, but other than that, 👍👍(made using the built in emoji button!)
Just bought this 16” monstrosity and all I do is write ✍️ all day….that screen did it for me. Yup, I don’t edit videos or do anything more than write and browse but that screen is too good to not buy.
Yesss ports are back, but this new thick design is bad
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a> you said M1 Max MacBook Pro but the text clearly says M1 Pro MacBook Pro. (Just saying)
Best pro since 2007
Man, you should give seminars to Youtubers on how to review things. Great review!
The notch is why i didnt buy  new iphones. Now they added notch to macs ... Uglyyyy
That notch is next level ridiculous
How heavy is it to carry around over the course of a day?
tbh i am the 1% that do , love the touch bar. i love the prediction when you type, emojis, I hope apple wont just cut it out completely. i hope there is a version with touch bar and version without for whoever fancies it

High impedance headphones like the huddoh sixhungeos by ol’ mate Senn
I really like your reviews. Crisp, well researched and relevant. But I think the big question people should ask at this stage is - we have all the hardware and speed we need. But where are the clients? Apart from Youtube, I can&#39;t really see any!!!
Great review.
I kinda miss the Touch Bar
Don&#39;t you use proxy when editing ?
I have the mid grade 16” and love it.
I just got mine this week — astounding. It&#39;s really an amazing computer. I got the MacBook Pro 16&quot;.
Just got the 16inch M1 Max and it&#39;s crazy how noticeably faster it is than the last one I had (2017). Using mainly for graphic design 🤙🏽



At the end of the day. The laptop is much thicker than the 2019 MacBook Pro. The camera cutout is utterly ugly. The case design is like backtracked 10 years. And general construction feels more like plastic. And those big vent holes? You bet dusts love it.

but do they have CD-ROM readers?
“If the next version of this laptop still has a notch this big and doesn’t add Face ID, I will wear Socks and sandals for a day 😂😂”
Great, clear presentation - thanks.
The notch is a bad joke. As much as I like Macbooks but this can&#39;t be it on a laptop.
Wow, great review!
Amazing Mac 💻 one of the 🔥most realistic laptop🤩🔥
Finding it hard resetting this M1 i was gifted, buh i connected to moe based of popular comments and he did unlock my MacBook without deleting any files 📂
It&#39;s about time Apple released a laptop worth upgrading. I can&#39;t wait to get mine!
I’m very impressed with both your ability to speak on task for so long without multiple takes and the smooth editing/splicing when you do. Great work!!!
Such a nice computer!!
This is Acorn laughing at Intel in Shanghai Mandarin, with an apple logo on it. RISC was always better, back in the &#39;90s.<br><br>The mac mini pro will be serious.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m14s">6:14</a>
Yea I couldn&#39;t agree more. Been using the maxed out Macbook 16 inch M1 Max for a week now, editing my content in Resolve 17 and wow...lets just say i&quot;m finally getting rid of my 10 Core iMac pro. This thing is an editing beast
Am I the only person that doesn’t mind the notch on the apple devices and actually things they look cool?
New video will come on my channel
Just hope Windows manufacturers don&#39;t copy the notch
Can’t believe he lugs a giant iMac with him to tech events 😳😳😳
Anyone know what the orange and brown desk is - with the curved side pieces? It’s gorgeous!
Honestly were did u get this nice intro beat from
Just bought the 16&quot; Max Pro myself. Can&#39;t wait to edit on it!
















Wouldn&#39;t including ethernet on the power adapter require a chunky connector like the iMac. Doubt Apple would ever bother engineering that.
But can it run Crysis Remastered? Probably not
This guy is so good finding reasons why apple uses cheap peripherals...
you should try gaming on it?
Great review Marques!
lmfao you should rename your channel no dislike guy
How good is the 14” in comparison to the 13”? Is it worth getting the 14” instead?
Would this be a nice upgrade from the 2012 MacBook Pro? Mine is still going strong after an SSD upgrade and ram upgrade

I think the notch is a great design
why not latest HDMI? Well apple had leftover HDMI ports from previous models that they used (FOR FREE) instead of spending money on the latest hardware. &quot;if it works it works, and we save money :)&quot;
Smart review nice crystal clear content
I’m just pissed they didn’t add a USB port, like for real why do we need TWO lightning ports. They could have replaced one of those with USB.
that&#39;s not the right way to unplug a cord, that&#39;s why they get messed up and they people is whining about them
Every product he reviews is 5 stars.    Nice side hustle.
Hi,when the apple silicon mac pro desctop will come out?
Awesome
People need to stop calling everything a dongle. A dongle is a little device that provides connectivity to another port, like a small HDMI to DVI converter, a USB-A to USB-C adapter, a small mini-hub, even a small SD card reader, I could accept. But an external DAC is certainly not a dongle. That&#39;s an external accessory, like an audio interface or a webcam. Most accessories can be connected without any dongles, and many accessories that have legacy ports like HDMI, USB-B, and Micro-USB can be connected without dongles because USB-C cables exist for them. I have a USB-A to USB-C dongle, and that&#39;s honestly about it for the dongles I&#39;ve ever needed on my USB-C only devices. In any case, I feel like people forget that even old MacBooks needed external devices to give them additional functionality, and that adding an SD card reader and HDMI output isn&#39;t going to change that for a lot of people. I&#39;m glad to have the ports, but also, can we acknowledge that very few MacBooks have ever had native HDMI outputs in the first place? Outside of 2012-2015 MacBook Pros, people needed dongles on pretty much every MacBook to enable HDMI output.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m38s">0:38</a> have you ever heard of portable monitors and ITX pcs.


i wonder if that camera covers the taps.
What&#39;s the &quot;external Thunderbolt DAC&quot; briefly mentioned?
All physical buttons????....no touch screen?....Apple is taking BEING UNIQUE to a whole different level😅
There&#39;s a Notch on the screen? Lol.
It‘ s just unbelievable…the praise, Apple get‘s all the time… but why… i live in Apples infrastuctre.. but it is …shit… nothing works… really… be it mac… be it homepods… be it iphone.. what ever you take… it just does not work the way it should… but obviously.. i‘m the only one…
Me watching this knowing I’m to broke for one
Phenomenal review.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m05s">16:05</a> 🤔 me thinking about MKBHD editing a recorded frame of editing a recorded frame
The other difference between the maxed-out 14&quot; and 16&quot;: the maximum GPU clock speed is about 200MHz lower for the 14&quot;. If you go with the 24-core GPU in the 14&quot;, you get the full 1295 MHz GPU clock speed. So, the 24-core GPU in the 14&quot; is almost the same performance (because of the lower clock speed for the 32-core) but it costs $200 less and probably burns through the battery a little more slowly. There&#39;s a video that talks about this, Max Tech I think? BTW, the 24-core version is implemented by disabling two cores in each of the four (eight-core) clusters, <b>not</b> by disabling one of the eight-core clusters. This is likely superior to disabling one full eight-core cluster from a performance point of view (memory system implementation details too detailed to be explained here).

As a PhD student who present a lot of presentation in classes, I have to say I am happy because that damn port has finally back 😏😏😏
🖤🤍🖤🤍
Amazing machine, God bless me so i can get one
honestly what the fuck has intel been doing?
I still have my 2014 MacBook Pro. I hated the Touch Bar. Now I am looking to upgrade.
you said ALL of this and all I heard was 768gbs of RAM.. whoa thats crazy.. oh and I need this M1max
Marques good video bro. one question though most of the programs I run are windows base. On my 2020 macbook i&#39;m able to run bootcamp. NOT PARALLES!  just wondering if you think they will bring bootcamp back or some other option close to it. thanks
Bro it supports 250 ohm ?
wow i feel personally offended. I always wear socks and sandles 🙄😆🤣😆😂 top vid as always 👌
Macs can automate a nuclear reactor and still be useless. After a long day of work a few minutes of gaming are what i need most. Gaming is what this powerful thing DOESN’T DO
Apple to MKBHD : You are not going to wear socks n sandals for a day. Here comes Face ID 🐼🍷
anybody saw the groot in the background
Me with a Lenovo Yoga 👁👄👁.
My rudimentary understanding is that it Mac can no longer play about a billion games after moving to 64-bit from 32-bit with Catalina. Does anyone know if that gets addressed?
How much apple pay for such commercial?
The thing is powerful no doubt...but it looks like an outdated dell laptop. The design is seriously trash but the performance is great.
As great as this is, just wait for the M2 pro macbooks on 4nm process and arm v9 architecture core design.
Imagine if they make iMac Pro with m1 max or pro m2 with notch 🤣
Why don’t laptops have hole punch cameras like on phones?
After living with my 16&quot; M1 MAX for about 48 hours now. I couldnt agree more with everything said in the video. furthermore. I never notice the notch
Anyone notice him looking over at the Apple Silicon Mac Pro Desktop at the end??? 👀
Getting one for sure. Probably the M1 PRO! :)
this company is a joke
My 2015 macbook pro sounds like a 747 at takeoff during logic pro sessions.... It&#39;s time for an upgrade
MKBHD do you still edit your own videos?
Can you share your studio setup and lighting setup, your gears <br>Because.. video screenplay is pretty awesome
Someone need to give this man an award for his intros <a href="about:invalid#zCSafez"></a>
“One less Dongle.”
I want this computer so bad but don&#39;t know if I need to upgrade just yet. I still have my 2014 Macbook Pro.
Can you do one for Alienware?
i will miss being able to scrub through youtube ads with the touch bar when i upgrade. but more seriously, i&#39;m definitely going to miss bootcamp ☹️
As someone starting college in January as a IT Major this is the machine I’m going with. I will be getting the 14 with the best Pro processor with the 1tb of storage. My 2009 Unibody Mac Pro doesn’t even work with the software my school requires. I feel old but this will be a welcome upgrade. I really like the M1 Chips. Seems Apple did something right and really nailed it this time around. Also giving the M1 Chips to the 13 was a good way to force users to get the Air or the 14 because the 13 is about useless right now.

No one will ever use this completely, just the 0, %. The rest are just bored rich people
Lou voice “No dongle” 👀
Ethernet would’ve been amazing. Hope they do that on the next model

You’ve never had a laptop with MagSafe MKBHD?
What is a professional???
The notch ruines the entire experience for me apple needs to dump the notch
Can you buy me a m1 max?
Latency is here...Marques
I love the new MacBook Pro, good for travel and coding 🔥
Every time i want to buy an apple product, i watch only your videos
Best review and intro out of all your videos
Does the laptop have a notch? 🤦
I wonder if/when the M1 Pro and Max will make it into the imac. I have a laptop, don&#39;t thnk I still need it for portability and would jump in on a 24&quot; imac if it had the more powerful chips set.
If you use xbox cloud streaming, AAA games run no problem
Please review the most basic of these new batch of computers from Apple, i.e. 14 MacBook pro with M1 pro 8 cores and 16 GB RAM. Please <a href="about:invalid#zCSafez"></a>
Good Job .. You gave some much needed information that no other channel that I have seen cover.
apple permanently blocked by iTunes account just because I purchased and added multiple Apple gift cards during thanksgiving (legitimately). :(.. all gift card money r locked in the account.. :(
One huge detail that you left out man. this heats crazy. i&#39;ve got one for myself and i am literally been using this for web browsing, not even heavy task. but this device heats up crazy hot. i don&#39;t see fans running and wifi signal is terrible . so far, all i&#39;ve just done is just watched youtube video on this device . i generally like your review. but this one you, i think you did not test this all the way.



I just got a new job and this was the laptop they sent me. I haven&#39;t used a mac in at least 10 years, so I&#39;m glad at least they sent one of the higher end models.
beautiful machinery
Size 14 will be the most popular, I think.
Now if it only had a superdrive... <b>sigh</b> 🥲
Hi, Thanks for the video. What is your macbook color?
i mean rendering somthing in windows aint take too long
atlast i can now upgrade from 2015 macbook pro.... :)
Good vedio
Please do Mac Pro vs razer blade pro please
Goddamnit. I love these M1s but they have made my life a living hell lol. I&#39;m an engineer, and using certain tools/services just dont work with the M1 chips and you have to go through a lot of trouble.
What would be more compelling to buy at this point in the Apple Eco system ... M1 MAX and 6k HDR Display or 16 Core Mac Pro ... hmm?
Every 5 years I upgrade my MacBook.  I enjoy it as its a jump.  Watching these kinds of videos of the new MacBooks is crazy.  So crazy that I actually am considering buying the lowest tier end M1 MacBook I can find.  Its too much laptop for my needs as a student.

EA will always have more dislikes than likes.
what they need to add also is sd card slot.
Yeah but the price…
How is carrying an Imac better than using a virtual environment? lol
Its not nxt level it VERA LEVEL 🔥<br>But they should bring this features to air also
Hi i’m looking for a new macbook but not sure which model to get. Things that are important to me..<br><br>Battery life, so i’m not dependable on finding power sockets when working in a cafe<br><br>Weight, not very important but definitely not the 16inch one. I like the 13inch size but the latest macbook m1 chips only comes 14inch and above<br><br>I take alot of 4k videos. Maybe some 5k videos. Amateur drone videos that i need to edit. I’m using an intel pc now (cant rmb the specs but def not high powered), can barely edit any videos. One click lags for 20secs then lag again<br><br>I need something that i can edit smoothly. Exporting time is ok. I can let it take its time to export and do something else<br><br>And also something that lasts for next 3yrs<br><br>Is the macbook air, macbook 13 m1 chip good enough? Or macbook 14 m1 pro, or macbook 14 m1 max?<br><br>I read that the new m1 max n m1 pro has shorter batt life. Hope to get advice. Thanks!




I need that Pelican case for my iMac. I don&#39;t really need it but I just think it looks cool...lol
Great video! one quick question, did you test the 14&quot; MacBook with 16 or 32 GB RAM?
Great review, concise, articulate and fun to watch. I have been using the 16 inch MacBook Pro for a couple of weeks. I&#39;ve been able to consolidate all of my audio and video production work on this machine, and without any of the performance issues I&#39;ve had on previous laptops and desktops. Pretty amazing.
Fl studio?
Super subtle, but thank you for changing the charging tone to a Bb instead of the usual A to fit the key of the intro!! 😭
Excellent review Marques, Thank you. I purchased an M1 MacBook Air 16G ram 512G SSD. Upgraded from an early 2011 MacBook Pro 13”. I’m an Actor. I use my system for self taping auditions GarageBand for voiceovers. Aspirations music production with Logic Pro. Had some connectivity issues with HP printer so Apple chat said update to Monterey. Now external monitor is iffy, Mokin USB C HUb doesn’t work. Will Max or Pro help me? Best, Tom
i really love this guy&#39;s editing; 11/10
trash
Which colour should I get? Silver or space grey?? Someone help!!

14&quot; Pro is the first Mac I&#39;ve owned, it replaces a Surface.  And in that capacity it&#39;s also next-level.
Excuse me, 768gb of ram??
I ve never had a Mac book before. People rave about it but after watching half this video I have no idea what the big deal is. So it has a 10 bit screen. Is it really necessary to spend $ 1200 when most people just use their phones.


Can anyone help?  I just received my MacBook Pro 16&quot; M1 Pro.  The lid is loose (no tension) when I go to open the lid until about 2 inches up.  Is this normal or a defect.  It&#39;s a little more tense when you go to close it, but then it kind of collapses right at the bottom.  I am looking at YouTube videos to find out if anyone else has this issue.  When I look at his opening the display in the video (tense throughout) it doesn&#39;t look like my issue.  Can anyone comment about your MacBook Pro and let me know if there is &quot;play&quot; when opening and closing?  There&#39;s also a little &quot;shimmy&quot; when opening up the display.  Thank you.
After waiting 6 years for Apple to sort them selves out, I ordered the 16&#39;  24 core GPU version. Compare that for me to the rest please.
whatever apple does... convenient in a pinch... apple shits on the stage... convenient in a pich .. very well... raining down tonne of money for marquese
is nobody gonna talk about that hideous notch? I don&#39;t get it how people are getting past that
786 GIGS of RAM?!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a> why you gotta diss him like that bruh
where do you get that groot?
Is the keyboard sunk enough as to not leave an impression on the screen?
watching this on my 2013 11 inch base model macbook air 😎 its nice to see apple is finally making really good computers again, the intel chips really seemed to be an Achilles heel

Had mine 3days ago 16&quot; is amazing
Intel hardware was just that bad
The thing is most macbook users already have adapters for all these ports. Now apple makes the macbook so thick to accommodate these ports
too much you, too little mac
All of the performance reviews in the video are about video editing. Isn&#39;t it kinda reviewing the device only for yourself?<br><br>I know that there are many who will need this machine for video editing, but there are also many others who have different needs. What about software developers, data scientists etc.? <br><br>It&#39;s like a TV channel reviewing their producers instead of creating content, it&#39;s a paradox.
That notch is too distracting like how TF do people not see this as a issue?

Upgraded from a 2014 iMac to the M1 Max 16 inch MBP. I can’t wait!
Please do review of every mac ever in one video if possible .And a huge fan
I use the touch bar for easy spelling
I&#39;m not a fan of apple cause they are a pretty greedy company but my god this MacBook pro is extremely impressive
Goodbye Intel and Hello Apple Silicon !!!
Did this guy just say his desktop cost $50,000??

I brought this to watch youtube videos. Im getting less lag and videos load a lot faster. Truely one of the best machines I ever used.
These edits are still just so fire lol
You&#39;re not going to have ethernet going through Mag Safe... I mean what is it you can&#39;t have it both ways... Do you want USB-C or Do you want Magsafe? If you want Magsafe you can&#39;t have Ethernet too, please use some logic here....
I have noticed you don’t do reviews on other laptops like hp, Lenovo. Can you make  some videos on other laptops in this same category as these apple laptops. <br>Thank you. 😊
These are only only 30% at best better than the M1 2020 models and have more ports. Nothing next level about them.
Damn that laptop thicc
All that is cool but where did you get that NYC train tracker from??
Hey Marques! I am Luke from India, Bangalore, I am a dj and Beat producer, I had a bad laptop and it&#39;s totally broken right now, I am so broke and I can&#39;t offered a laptop, It would be amazing if you can give away me any laptop man! Please help me.🙏 I love your videos. Lots of love from India brother.❤️
Great review. Thank you.
Weapon Case?
What is the actual utility of the notch other than just being a design quirk?

Sd card woaww 🤣
So Gen 1 Apple surpasses all Laptop CPU&#39;s and most desktop CPU&#39;s in performance<br>Gen 2 Apple just destroys everything apart from high-end Threadrippers in specific applications and only because of raw core/thread gap.<br><br>That&#39;s disgusting Apple
Apple: &quot;YEAH! Lets add a useless touchbar, take away dedicated ports, and get rid of Magsafe chargers! That&#39;ll be a great move!&quot;<br><br>Also Apple: &quot;Yeah... that was dumb...&quot;
&#39;worlds thinnest laptop&#39; now they restart with thicker and later will come up with better thinner one later release , point is seems like you are boud to compromize ad like , and after developing a knack for touch bar tgey remove , will come back later release . its all marketing ithough your reviews are honest !

Very Well Done!!!
Great breakdown. Thanks!
This the most positive i&#39;ve ever heard him speak about an Apple product, mark this moment down in history!
I am not feeling the retro design at all. It looks dated.
that introduction motion graphic was appreciated.
I love how they are slowly going back to the 2015 model. At least apple is listening.
Only rich, check marked people are ordering one. Nobody else can afford this shit with no jobs still


Can you do not review apple before they make an actual impact on their macs. 😒 apple are beginning to reach the dump&amp;dumper era. <br>If creativity ended then they should stop scams and admits it. 👎💔

Anyways i love it 🤍
Why is there a black rectangle at the top of the screen? How does that not disqualify from being called &quot;next level&quot;? Even budget phones have got rid of that.

I feel old now when Marcus said he has never used a MagSafe-equipped device. Wow ok
64gb of ram is more ram than storage on my iPad. Go to 16.25 of the video and see it!
Thanks brother
Ngl when I saw apple unveil these new MacBook pros my first thought was “I wonder if marques is gonna be able to stop Bringing the iMac Pro around now” lol
Still this fucking notch in the top fuck apple
Hey Marques - the notch height is chosen for design reasons to match the menu bar. If they reduced the height, then it wouldn&#39;t match the menu bar without making the menu bar smaller, and it is already fairly small.

Both Windows and Macs are CRAP. At Windows are cheap. Macs are expensive crap

The return of Magsafe is the second best thing about this laptop.
I can&#39;t  find the intro music in his playlist or on 20syl&#39;s channel. Does anyone know what it is?
768 GB of RAM, simply overkill
Hello. I am a cyber security student and living in Albania. I am struggling to get a laptop for my work/projects in UNI because the wages here are very low and i cannot save enough due to macbook prodcuts  being high priced. I hope someone generous enough would help me if someone has a spare laptop which he doesnt use. I would be thankful for life. I currently do my work/projects in computer shop caffees because i dont own my own laptop. I know its not good to ask around here but i am without other possibilities. It would be a dream come true for me as it would boost my cyber seurity career. I hope someone can understand, thank you very much and god bless your families! &lt;3
Anyone notice that the sound speakers are not as clear as the previous 2019 mbp? Human voices are too low
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m24s">16:24</a> bro its not only 64 gb ram its a lot
RIP Touch Bar. I actually used it.
I hate the notch.
Glad the touchpad is gone. It was the worst thing ever
I thought he was kidding about traveling with an iMac, oh boy this is so weird..
I think apple should add 14” with m1 and 8gb ram 256ssd for 1500s, touchbar is hated by pro. But businessman like me love touchbar
I’m just waiting for an M1 Pro and Max Mac Mini. I’m debating on buying the M1 Mac Mini but if the newer Mac Mini’s are right around the corner… 👀
Mine’s arriving this monday. Absolutely pumped I can finally put my dell to the side and have some actual power in my laptop!

the way his face lights up when he says no touchbar
Great video - the final cut waveform redraw is an issue with FCP 10.6 -
“Kinda annoying that such an expensive computer doesn’t have the latest highest end parts”. Apples motto since forever.




Getting mine tomorrow!
Man, this technology is getting absolutely crazy
From mg squad
Thanks so much Also so helpful!
Hi mkbhd, there are numerous issue that observed when extended display is attached mac book pro and which drops mac book pro performance can you suggest what could be done to better that or what is that can help to improve the performance of Mack book with extended display
long story short - best laptop ever
I really don’t need this power but I also don’t have the money to spend on these. I bought one nonetheless
Any nice cases for these yet?
a lil&#39; too late, but how do so many, including Marques get their M1 Max Macbook Pro so quickly? I&#39;ve been checking almost everyday since the models&#39; announcement, and the earliest I could get my hands on any 1 model is in mid-December. And if I customise to have the maximum RAM, I&#39;d have to wait until mid-January. This is for delivery within the UK that is. Can someone please enlighten me? Thanks and good day to you, whoever&#39;s reading this. Regards


I upgraded from my Late 2013 15&quot; MBP to a 14&quot; M1 Pro, and well, I haven&#39;t opened the 2013 one in weeks... These new iterations are great for everything!


I’m really happy that Apple produces these incredible machines for professionals. I would be even happier if Apple one day also produces a decent machine for consumers and not only still expensive (for consumers!) but weak or otherwise handicapped (only one or two ports that are also used for charging etc.) machines.
All this time I thought that was a camera you were rolling in that big ol&#39; box.
Great video i just ordered one!!!
World best laptop.I realy love it .<br>But Steve jobs never approves this design, special notch . He like stylish and simple .

if you say it’s great then I do not need to watch any more reviews, I’m buying one. I wonder how many buying decisions have been based on your reviews, myself I’ve bought a few products over the years solely on your recommendation.
Thanks. You helped me make my decision.
i used to have a pair of DT770s they were awesome.
Imagine you are having ethernet on a charger and you by mistake disconnect that charger in the middle of streaming a video. How convenient is that??
You Are Fantastic Man ♥️🥇
Whenever mommy makes good food 😋! <br><br>Me - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m17s">20:17</a>
what&#39;s the difference between hdmi 2.0 and 2.1?
768 gb of ram!!!
On a 2012 MacBook Air… upgrading to one of these is going to be life changing 😂
Hi Marques, great vid as usual. Quick question what&#39;s the Desk model you&#39;re using (min <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m40s">8:40</a>)? Thanks and keep up that awesome reviewing. Cheers from Germany
MKBHD editing team deserves a “Best Intro Creator of The Year” award 🙌
I wish Apple would offer a 16 in but with less of all the crazy awesome specs that the average user wouldn&#39;t even need.  I just need the 16 inches but don&#39;t want to pay $2600 bucks for one that will have a ton of stuff I will never use.  Too much computer for my needs - but I want a 16 in screen!

Finally an actual upgrade to the 2012 Macbook Pro! Been waiting 9 years!!
Still no regular USB port smh
Did you already tried to connect your Macbook Pro Max to 3 Monitors? I’m just wondering because nobody is addressing this topic on their reviews

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a> That&#39;s about 760 GB more than I have...
&quot;Pretty good in a PINCH&quot; is the theme of this video!!!
Ah yes, 2027
I spent thousands on audio plugins for music production for switching completely to mac but That notch makes me think. Maybe Next model
I suddenly miss the butterfly switches.
Excellent overall. But your high-impedance headphone explanation does not fly. High impedance is associated with lower power. To deliver significant power to a high impedance load requires higher voltage. It’s Ohms law in action.
upgrading it with ssd)
Next Level????? trash performance + crazy 1080p notch with no face id. lol


Is the memory self upgradeable ?

I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals ! I&#39;m deeeaaaddddd
Obviously this thing is a beast on the inside, and that&#39;s really exciting. To say it&#39;s great on the outside is... well, only half true. Yes, the ports are great (albeit not top-tier) but I haven&#39;t been bothered by dongles since my first month with my 2018 MacBook Pro. The notch is ugly and ridiculous, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get over it in two days like I did when I got my first notched iPhone. (They should still not have made it have a notch though) The new keyboard is ugly, but that&#39;s a very minor issue. The two worst parts of this new design are the overall shape and the removal of the Touch Bar.<br><br>I have an old, probably no-longer-functional 2005 MacBook in storage. One of the old white plastic ones. Seeing this design immediately made me think of that MacBook, and that&#39;s the opposite of a good thing! They could have easily kept the great design of the 2016-2020 MacBook Pros while making it thicker and adding ports, but they apparently went for some unfortunate nostalgia. This isn&#39;t the end of the world, but it is disappointing to see for sure.<br><br>I know the Touch Bar is controversial, but it&#39;s one of the best parts of my MacBook Pro. The removal of the Touch Bar is going to make me hold on to mine for longer, past when the price is finally offset by the benefits and when my current one starts to show the need to be replaced. I use my Touch Bar ALL THE TIME and there are so many convenient applications for it. If anything, it&#39;s held back by the lack of third-party support in apps and games that could definitely benefit from leveraging it. There are two easy ways to fix the controversy here: sell a model with the Touch Bar and one without it, or simply add the Touch Bar above a row of function keys. (Nobody needs full-height function keys anyway) I literally forgot for YEARS that you could put function keys on the Touch Bar with the function key... that&#39;s how useless they are to me. Their functions work even better on the Touch Bar than with static, outdated function keys.<br><br>I mourn the loss of the Touch Bar, and I blame users for pressuring Apple to remove one of the best external innovations they&#39;ve had in years on the MacBook. It could have been on external keyboards, on the Air... and it could have been great. But whatever... hit your volume key ten times while I slide volume with one gesture that takes less time away from my work. Move your cursor all over the screen to find what you need while I toggle it all right above my keyboard. You got what you wanted... your loss!
No rtx 3080 o quadron = pure trash

I got the 16” last week and this review is spot-on. Skin oil and fingerprint smudges were visible on the trackpad and keyboard after the first day of use. Little specks of my dandruff are already wedged between some keys, and they are more noticeable because of the backlight. So, backlit dandruff.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Your reviews are brilliant. Thank you
Thank you! After 25 MBP vids you are the only guy that talks about the headphone jack in detail!. I hope the 14&quot; MBP sounds good with my HD 660s&#39;s
UGLIEST MACBOOK PRO EVER!!! NO MATTER WHAT THE SPECS ARE , I WOULD FEEL EMBARRASSED TO USE IT NEAR USERS WITH ASUS ZEN BOOK AND OLD MACBOOKPRO M1 WITH TOUCHBAR . Mkbhd is a power junkie due to his video works for general user it is back to bulk/past.
Today i was about to get macbook pro 2020 but unfortunately its out of stock because of this dude

2400 euro is too much. 1400 euro for a macbook pro was good
I upgraded from my Late 2013 15&quot; MBP to a 14&quot; M1 Pro, and well, I haven&#39;t opened the 2013 one in weeks... These new iterations are great for everything!

i think you are amazing.
I felt he is trying to hide the flaws by saying it is acceptable. Bro with a 1500$ Laptop, we expect it to have very few flaws -_-
They’re actually thinner than the previous model.
Mine should be here tomorrow.  Looking forward to using this for my channel and videos.  Coming from a 2015 MacBook Pro.
MKBHD editing team deserves a “Best Intro Creator of The Year” award 🙌
Fuck that notch, I wont buy it.
the design got worse
BAAAYDA
Sometimes I’m convinced that he makes apple’s commercials

&quot;Only 64GB of Ram&quot;
Just Windows on it is now missing


Thinking about getting one to run my business and produce; whether I am in my apartment or not, thanks for the review!
Great report and evaluation, Mr.m Brownlee. You made me feel much better about my recent purchase of the MacBook Pro 16-inch. Like you, I do. a lot of video editing and I am super happy with the ease of use and quick rendering time. Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for the great report.
The top notch is a crime against humanity. I&#39;d rather have NO camera than this thing...<br><br>They redeemd themselves by removing this abomination from HELL called touchbar.
Honestly this is what I would probably upgrade to considering it has actual ports which hasn’t really been a thing since the 2011-13. If I had the money I’d upgrade from my 2011 I would.

Help Help office 360 runs good? fast? normal? I use power point a lot and i cant change since its company policy!!!
All that tech and still no touch screen. 👎


@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=15m03s">15:03</a> Low key statement of the year. Marques - I work with video too...
my use case is watching anime. When I was a student it was coding. I had a 2009 laptop I used everyday until I spilled big red... now I have a 2018 mbp for anime and no drinks around this time.
Socks and sandals in the Canadian winter. Or it ain&#39;t like Linus.
... why not just have a server in the studio and remote connect into it?? lmao
Do you think the MacBook Pro M1 MAX is worth it? Is it future proof in comparison to what is potentially coming next year?

I couldn’t find anywhere how This new MacBook handles heavy excel usage? I’d love to get this but not knowing that is holding me back
Bruh first 10 seconds were better than the official mac ad
it is what it is lol
Apple just took a step back and thought about real usability.
First time I am watching this channel, editing is next level. Nice review, thank you!
Apple is so consumed with this fucking notches that they put on every device these days. <br>2022: here comes the apple charges with notch too.🤣

Buy DMG Audio Essence, choose solo vocal ds preset - set to hq mode in settings, pull down threshold and voila.
great ..
Nice Pixel 6 dbrand colors 👍
you are officially an isheep for apple products

Great summary! All good news, so far. Any idea about the performance improvement in Media Composer?
no time for noise reduction as it seems 🙄
since you officially retired the travel iMac in one of your videos, it will be no use for you; Can I get it? lol I&#39;ll pay for the shipping costs haha            <br><br><br>P.S. I am subscribed and have the notifications activated
I never bought a apple macbook, I think I might buy this and use it for the next 5 -7 years.
You got it completely wrong with the Ethernet Mate. The very concept of having it on a power brick definitely works for a stationed machine. But not for a laptop. Imagine having internet connectivity on your MacBook only when it’s plugged into your power brick! I simply don’t see a real world scenario where it works. Hotels just have WiFi and nobody willingly gives you Ethernet off their private network. And your own workspace / home will definitely have WiFi too. Besides, you’d be furious not having internet on your MacBook when it’s away from the desk. Even the very concept of a mobile machine totally rules out the concept of having an Ethernet port in your power brick. Besides, who carries their MacBook power bricks with them nowadays?
Incredible!
I bought the 14 on release day. Just returned it and got the 16&quot; I love them both, but I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s the best laptop they ever made. The notch was a terrible idea, but it&#39;s easy enough to hide it thanks to the top notch app. My 2006 MacBook pro was AMAZING. I think that was the best MacBook they ever made. The first Intel MacBook pro
Touchbar for the win
3 minutes and 49 seconds. jesus.
next level of thickness
That was such a good review. Not a single second wasted.
Only thing is Monterey is not compatible with a lot of music programs.
People with money: Yeah, I need one for my powerpoints
In your M1 iPad Pro review you said if the M1 iPad Pro got the macOS makeover that you wanted (with Final Cut Pro) you wouldn&#39;t have a MacBook...has the new M1 Max MacBook changed your mind?
Hey Marquess - good stuff - ever gonna do a dyson product review? T
as usual apple makes the ugliest &quot;notches&quot;.
Can you stop saying Jesus in your videos?
Hey Marques, do you use Final Cut Pro for all of your videos/editing? Or is there another editing software you use as well? And if you don’t use anything else, is there anything you would maybe recommend someone to use incase they couldn’t afford Final Cut Pro right away n wanted to use something more affordable temporarily?
iPad M1 &gt; MacBook M1<br>I just got an M1 iPad Pro and am so heppy :)
Apple has some GuluGulu designers indeed........................
I needed 64 gb of ram so my google docs runs smoothly. Trust
Running a docker container on my old one sounds like a jumbo jet
sound is out of sync
The new Macbook Retina with notch ;-)
I was very pleased to hear how many times the word dongle was used
the travel iMac Pro... how relatable... stfu
I think the MacBook Pro will get the punch hole design and ditch the notch for the camera, the same or following year the iPhone does.

I can’t believe I just bought one, incredible
Price?

“If ya have to ask what high impedance is you can’t afford it big guy “ 🤣
768GB of RAM....<br>WTAF...
Is it just me that find it more relaxing listening to MB videos compare to music while at work? XD
You must boycott and refuse to buy and promote these expensive products because their prices are much more expensive than the costs of research, development and production, and this is called outrageous profit.
💜💜👌👌👌👌👌
I LOVE that! I still own and use a mid 2010 15&quot; macbook pro and this is the first MBP I feel it can replace the perfection of laptop my current nearly 12 year old MBP is (after upgrading it with ssd)


what blew me away was the ports
whats the name of the song in the beginning???
So can not plug into 8k

I actually think I figured out why they have the notch: It&#39;s so that you don&#39;t put a fingering on the camera every time you open the laptop. It doesn&#39;t seem like a huge deal, but think about it - if you had to wipe off your camera literally every single time you wanted to use it, it would be such a huge design flaw and oversight.
I likely will not touch the edges of the power of this laptop, but this is one of the best reviews of a laptop I&#39;ve ever seen in it&#39;s completeness, comprehensiveness and clarity. It covered every conceivable aspect I would be interested in and did it in such a way and with a clear explanation that I am now able to not only be confident of purchasing a new MacBook Pro, but which one and in which configuration. That is a very important aspect, as I work for a non-profit and need to make a definitive decision and not have to regret it - because I&#39;ll have it a very long time. Kudos!




JESUS I know you love me. Please give me the opportunity to love you back , to hug you back , to welcome you back into my heart.                  🏡💜🎈
I miss the Touch Bar
none of their macs have been a major upgrade since like 2016 so im sticking to my 2017 for a long long time and the notch on the top is dumb asf and literally makes no sense.

Marques such an apologist for apple products, won&#39;t admit that the notch was rushed afterthought and is a terrible design. They could have done better, for the price that people are paying for this laptop. I mean they went back 5 years on hardware and still charge more... 🤣 can&#39;t make this stuff up



Mine is coming in 10 days and I literally can’t even wait. M1 Max is gonna be amazing for my audio and video production!!
Overpriced as always

I would recommend you should do a video from the developers perspective as well because I’m searching a lot over the Internet whether these new M1 Pro’s are compatible with a Java, python and whatever the programming languages out there.
Steve Jobs said the keyboard and trackpad are areas you don’t wanna mess with, guess Apple learned this the hard way about the touch bar.
Not gonna lie... bought the maxed out 14&quot; because I&#39;ve been holding out since 2010, and my 2010 Macbook Pro is definitely on its last legs. The last few generations of Macbook Pro was...NOT what a Pro should be, at least in my opinion, and this new one is a proper Macbook Pro...Finally got one after a decade of waiting












Not touch screen yet and no one asks about.  Everyone are apple sheep







<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> “A new top-notch design”<br>Pun intended :D
Why buy the M1 Max when the M2 will be 20X faster ?   That&#39;s why i hate Apple ! As soon as they release new products i own the M1 Max its ok but weeks later the bastards are promoting the M2 . To be honest my Lenovo Legion 5 is superior in many many ways these videos are useless
Came for the sweet music. Didn&#39;t disappoint.
The sound in this video seems strangely out of sync….or something…..
Jesus is the truth, the way and the life! Come to him all who are weary and burdened, and he will give you rest for your souls. He loves you! Shalom and God bless! 🙏🏾
official mac boy! (no one will take serious my comment)
That notch is trash.
Whish you could make a video review of the M1 Max with the XDR PRO displays and try to push the system to the limits. That would be a wonderful review, that only you can pull out, with your two displays in the office. If you get a third display, that would be the cherry in the cake.
Me: damn..cant afford one...<br>My wallet: one less dongle...🤣🤣🤣
i feel like there is a fix where you can keep the function keys and touchbar together, how botu just move the touchbar a bit up so that there can be space of function keys
Ⓜ💙💖<br>mantap 👍👍
I literally watch MKBHD videos in 5.1 surround on a 4K TV because it feels wrong to do it any differently. Damn the quality is so good.
Intel chips are in shambles lol. What a trash.
They gotta remove that notch man so ugly. look at Dell XPS
<b>Bank:</b> Have fun getting a car with that loan<br><b>Me:</b> The loan is not for the ca…never mind
I still carry an iMac on location for work….
the asmr type of sound going in the background is really annoying. :(
Apple is being excited that an ultra expensive, flagship latop comes with ports...  Let that sink in

Marques has the new MacBook pro 16-inch shipped yet? I just bought one. The salesman told me this is the new one but it appears to have the Intel chip and has on 16 GB of memory.

Can we install Microsoft office


Thanks for sharing this review video. But what I need to know is, how if we use Adobe after effects or primiere for the 3d. How if we use Adobe after effects, Photoshop, Google Chrome, and illustrator at the same time, is this MacBook still working perfectly ? Hope you will make a review about it.



So once again (minus the notch) add everything regular electronics have had for years and everyone loses their mind



What is that intro track called? It&#39;s awesome.

Incredible stuff …. Expensive but, yeah … incredible!

Literally a top notch design

So the 14” pro base you’re paying for 369 million Apollo guidance computers worth of computing power, nice

Only problem for me about MacBooks is... these device screens are like mirror... absolutely terrible for long term development work.

you are the biggerst apple shill on youtube and its not an easy title to achieve with all the shills out there, shameless


You really have the capacity to make an video to get a crore views with just a intro✌️

Man you buy all these Apple products yourself? Isnt that like really expensive?




Apple veteran 10% discount is appreciated.

I love that Groot behind you...awesome🔥🔥🔥🔥❗❗❗❗

this is definitely not for people who are not doing some really heavy photo/video editing

I&#39;ve waited so long to upgrade from my 2012 MacBook Pro that has been struggling for YEARS, I&#39;m beyond excited to get one of these.

Would you still buy a Mac Pro?

How much VRAM does the Max have?

Apple fanboys are actual masochists at this point.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m07s">17:07</a> I believe it should be M1 Max MBP instead of M1 Pro MBP with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a> Min redertime

Great review. Greetings from Turkey :).

👍

you could say this video is &quot;top notch&quot;

&quot;top notch&quot; video!

In other words, i will never be able to afford one of these laptops.

I definitely waited for this to drop before watching any other reviews

A macbook that really looks more like a Dell computer....just speaking out loud

Apple macbook new release is just a PC Laptop copy, a beautiful hypocrisy. Next will be the touch screen.







Did my guy SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT GB of RAM?!

that camera notch kills it for me.

Excellent review and presenting chops!

Truly it cost what I earn in 4-5 months

I&#39;ve been waiting for an M1 review like yours. Thank you!! This is on my shopping list.

No more Jonny Ives design-blocking. 🤷🏻‍♂️

I honestly feel like apple could of kept the touch bar and made it more useful. I like to screenshot, put words in bold face, and it is really useful for graphic design. I like the new MacBooks but am I the only one who think the Touch Bar could of been made slightly better.
Might be time to upgrade.
Can this process ProRes video files fast?
7...7... 768 gigs of ram?... 🤯 😅 Holyyyyy
&quot;One less dongle&quot; - Marquees Brownlee, 2021
Still so expensive. Not worth to pay
Apple&#39;s greatest ever achievement...  This guy said their product next level for almost half an hour....
Somehow I&#39;m getting some Logan Paul&#39;s vlog flashback from that background music
I didn&#39;t notice the notch until you mentioned it, and now I can&#39;t stop looking at it. thanks. lolol
Another great video but I think I will wait until next year’s model to come out.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m50s">0:50</a><br>Marq got drip. Rocking the &quot;Not for Resale&quot;
Huh! 768gb of RAM🤯
I need one
This starting Music is just Next Level!
I thought i was they only one lugging around an iMac 😂🤣
Think the 2020 model looks more elegant
Z fold Nation
just want it for battery life and bigger screen lol
This is the first macbook i&#39;m actually considering getting.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=5m28s">5:28</a> one thing worth noticing is they&#39;ve moved the headphone jack to the left, so as most headphones have their cable running from the left earpiece, it prevents a lot of cable mess




















ATTENTION PLEASE! :)<br><br>I just received my 2021 MBP 16&quot; M1 Pro and I quickly realised that I had not thought of any protection for it!<br>Does anyone of you have good suggestions when it comes to cases, covers or stands for this new design? <br><br>Would appreciate any suggestions! Thanks
A &quot;few&quot; walk backs? Thicker + ports + mag-safe + goodby touch bar ?  few walk backs
Well.   Just an apple fans.

If you carry iMac in India, you will be asked to pay import tax…
You can feel the excitement on Marques&#39;s face. Apple did quite well with this one 🙌🏿 🔥

Whilst in the minority I really liked the touch bar and will miss it
sevenhundredsometing gigs of ram ) nice
&quot;Top-Notch design&quot; just slipped that pun in there loll
Got the 14 Max.. maxed out! but disappointed it won’t recognize Thunderbolt 2 drives 👎🏽 connecting an OWC Thunderbay 4 not recognized. Are you hearing anyone else with issues like this?
still confused why they got rid of USB Ports..
Why not put the 12 megapixel FaceTime camera found in the iPhone on this Mac
Good luck gaming on one
Is it any good for developers ?
bruh like a imac wile traveling
Performance was absolute trash, I had my money refunded as this laptop is the most overpriced piece of turd I&#39;ve ever seen.<br>Replaced it with a Razer that blows it out of the water for any editing.
Does anyone else also thinks this specific review of Marques seems totally biased? To me it feels like he really likes macs and he is now telling us how this upgrade meet all his expectations. As if he completely forgot about the windows laptops!<br><br>FYI, I use windows desktop, base model MacBook Air and iPhone.
Here is the apple hater dragging a huge a luggage with apple desktop computer to edit- omg bro 😂
This is 0.01 review and 99.9 advertising. This dude speaks like an apple employer. What is with that ugly notch in the middle of the screen? All components still soldered? In 3 years you can throw on garbage that junk.
I think this is one of your best reviews ever. Wow 🙌🏻









bias
A beautiful sight
I&#39;m kinda annoyed that apple thinks the only people who need an HDMI port and sim card slot are final cut editors.

I got the 16 inch M1 max, 64 gb RAM, 32 core GPU mbp for my machine learning work. It works great. Apple has released a Tensorflow plugin to use the GPUs. Some of the packages are not supported yet though, have to wait 😞
How do you express consent for purchases when you have Face ID on a Mac for purchases? On an iPhone to trigger the UI to scan your face for paying for something, you need to double press the power button. So, lets think about a workflow on the Mac, you press the power button twice and you pay for it? But, you can already press it once and Touch ID takes care of your payment. And, the con, how do you prevent apps from charging you from the background when you are not even aware of it.
Still using the masterpeice 2015 &#39;15 MBP.. Seems like it&#39;s high time to switch to this bad boi :D
As if like he invented…😂
I’m hoping this power will come to the Mac mini soon. The usable power of the M1pro in that form factor would just be ideal for me. But dang this review got me re-assessing if I should go portable.




why is it so expensive for the 14 inch

Love you, but I’m triggered that the 0 didn’t wrap around the 0
;)
It&#39;s funny but disappointing that while it has all of these great things to it, one thing, the os, could make all of them not matter.<br><br>Basically meaning that this would be a laptop I buy if the os was something I actually liked.



&quot;top notch design&quot;<br>I see what you did there
I’m definitely pushing the limits of my 2014 mackbook air
Such a great review man❤️
Tyler stalman❤️
Next level of prices.
Honestly I gotta say the tracking shot at the beginning is so bad considering your camera work is something any young editor would die for...
Did he say 786gigs of RAM!!!????
Overpriced Rubbish, Oh that&#39;s right you get it all for nothing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a> punny
Curious as to why no one mentions the 4 black, rubber legs... I mean it&#39;s already lost it&#39;s looks with the black on black keyboard. (is it even backlit?) Couldn&#39;t Apple have at least carved out a niche on each side to pick it up?
Did I just hear 768GB of RAM???!
&quot;Tool to get a job done&quot;? You lifted that from Dave2D🤣
Your presentation - blows me away.....thank you &amp;  keep up the great work! 👍 😎
From where can i get that groot in india
Woah! You can plug headphones into it too!? Now THATS pro! I wish my &quot;pro&quot; ipad and &quot;pro&quot; phone could do such a simple, basic task!
From a software engineer who also edits videos/photos while still using a 2017 macboook pro, i5 processor, 8 gb memory, this review makes me emotional.

So, this is a real Pro laptop, laser-focused for actual professionals. Neat. They finally actually lived up to their Pro labelling and marketing.






































<b>Need help? Dm👆 ASAP for solution</b>
💚Thank You!!!👍🏽
I got the 16inch max and I’ve edited 3 videos this week without charging it once 🤯
It’s great that you can still charge it with thunderbolt as well MagSafe!
Top notch design indeed
Does anyone see the black scar on the perfectly clean wall on the right forehead of   Marques? Why does it make me uncomfortable for the whole video. 🙄
Nah man. I’ve been using the 13” every day for hours upon hours for almost 2 weeks, and I HATE THE NOTCH. I always had the menu bar auto hide so that I could use the full screen, and I just can’t do that anymore, I always have some of the desktop peeking out. It’s awwwful, and apple won’t even let you drag a window under it.


Wow apple actually made a laptop this time and not a macbook. crazy.

I’ve watched every review of the popular tech channels this is so close to 4 million I’ll watch again haha
Can’t wait to wait 3 years to buy it when it gets cheaper
How much Apple paid for this latest future laptop with old crap ?

Hey Marques I thought your audio and effects are amazing do you use one specific source to get it. Please Maybe Reply
I always used MacBooks for photography work and I love the 16 inch.
What you say is so not true. There was options of computers instead of an imac.
What is the wallpaper? Really like it
Currently I have the 16 inch Mac book pro. I feel like I’m not utilizing it enough.
This guy…
I don’t see the different between HDMI 2.0 and 2.1 or whatever they looks the same
Yeah I bet that price next level to…
Where can I get that groot plant?
I see Groot at the back ground 😅💯
Anyone else having issues with the SD slot not reading or copying mov files? my late 2013 15&quot; macbook pro retina 8GB / 256GB previews the files directly from the SDXC card in finder no problem, my new 16&quot; M1 Pro 16GB 1TB isn&#39;t able to do this with 1080 or 4K, tried on 2 machines now same problem.
I&#39;ve always said people look at notches wrong. if you view it as cutting into your screen, then yes it&#39;s annoying. <br>Instead, you need to see it as your screen gaining ears into where the bezel used to be, to move time/date/battery/menu items up out of the way.<br>of course software has to incorporate it smartly as well, or you will get the notch encroaching where it isn&#39;t wanted or blocking things.



786 GB of RAM? WTF
Being hyped about ports really tells us a story.
Can I play Apex Legends smoothly often on the 16 inch M1  Pro ?

If y&#39;all could buy more SHIB coin so I can buy a 16inch that&#39;d be great!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m27s">16:27</a> wait, what do you mean by 768 gigs of RAM?

You had me at GROOT! Lol, great info thanks
Can&#39;t wait to see you in socks sandals 😁
Where is the MacBook Pro video?? 😹😉
Your intro&#39;s are mind blowing 🙂
apple sheep
The notch tho...why!
can anyone send me to a tutorial that will tell me how he did that 2021 animation on the macbook at the beginning of the video
Fast forwarding Instagram videos on desktop?<br>Are you ok bro？
The m1 max chipset is amazing, but may i know does it cool properly?? Because with intel core i5 chips, i am having a lot of hearing issues, so i think that it will also have a bad cooling.


Can a billionaire please but me one, I need it for school. Like I do data modeling and my laptop takes forever
It&#39;s really great. I like this product
Performance aside, these new MBPs physical appearance looks  atleast 10yrs older than its last version. I’m really disappointed that there is no touch bar on these newer ones. I give a big thumbs down to the design team.
Carrying an imac to an event!! No wonder why people call you a blind fanboy. There are other options as well but heyy i am a fanboy, so lets carry imac.
one problem i found with my M1 Max, when connecting to external monitor, the mouse drag didn&#39;t work, sometime it works but most of the time the drag is stuck. I don&#39;t know if this monterey or M1 things. I use benq 32 inch, and it works fine when connecting to my old 16inch 2019 mbp.
Im sorry bro it costs more than my pc

People will get used to it just like they did with the iPhone X
M1 made by tsmc sells like apple product pathetic loser company people belive in apple lies  M1  trotled overheating and explode 😂

I use a lot of Native Instruments software, and at this point the only thing keeping me from buying an M1 Max MacBook Pro is the lack of compatibility between NI&#39;s programs and Monterey. It&#39;s a shame because these new models are incredible, and even though I really want one it would be of no use for what I&#39;d need it to do. The Logic Pro X producer crowd got lucky, but the rest of us are screwed.

its insane to me how most games are still shipping with Mac support, but without Linux support. the former is literally putting effort and engineering into a single company&#39;s completely locked down ecosystem, and the latter is the most open, the most compatible software stomping grounds ever cobbled together.<br><br>you build for Linux, and you&#39;ve built for thousands of companies and their users. you build for Mac, you are expecting a single company to stay alive and maintain their customer base. ludicrous.
I’ve had a bitch if a time on linux and in windows over the years. Picked up an m1 MacBook Pro and loved it. I’ll wait for their tower Mac in a few years and probably upgrade to that.
Marques Brownlee talking about the new Macbook whatever model thing:   <b>TRULY NEXT LEVEL</b><br>Also Marques about the same thingamajigabobberwhatsitdoohickey : It doesn&#39;t support any of these high end top notch technologies, but it&#39;s pretty good in a pinch and requires one less dongle<br><br>Meanwhile, Apple being Apple, laughing all the way to the bank while people buy their products in spite of the fact that Apple just basically force fed them stuff they didn&#39;t want and told them to get fucked.
Looks super promising, especially for Videos and Final Cut. But just as side comment on the exterior...it&#39;s really ugly and bulky! I can&#39;t understand how they did it so ugly compared to the previous one
UHS-III *does not exist*. There are no cards for the standard, it’s being skipped.
Holy shit I HATE that notch. That&#39;s really awful in my opinion. Something we all know wasn&#39;t necessary even with the phones but they&#39;re making it into a trademark. Don&#39;t like it at all.
Maybe one day I will have one of these (•‿•)
you just said, 768gig Ram :(
A user with daily usage will have to use Windows for most of his tasks can you review Windows on this laptop? You tried hard to hide the notch
&quot;Never used a magsafe full time&quot;... I feel quite old 😂
Here is the best MacBook.🤗
I wonder how these apples hold up to durability and repair cost over 5 - 7 Years.<br>I&#39;m not a fan of laptops, my PC build is 5 Years old and still performs without meeting limitations. I however don&#39;t do content editing.


Does it work for civil engineer ?
real secret is most people only need a $300-$500 laptop to do pretty much everything they are going to need laptop for (work, browsing, social media, writing stuff, calculations etc). <br>Even some of the high end work you&#39;ll be set nicely with $500-$1000 range.<br>Like Bro I don&#39;t even understand why anyone want to pay $3500 for?? not mentioning M1 Max is pretty much worthless for gaming !!
Feels like Apple has understood dongles are stupid afterall.
I love the menubar and having a much smaller one is a big downgrade for me
I get 4k 100hz on my M1 Mac mini
&quot;top notch design&quot; 😭
You have always preferred big screen :-)
Why not just take a powerful laptop
Wait what? 768GB of ram? WTF
Ports are the only reason why I would get one of these
I don&#39;t believe that an imac was the only thing that could do what nothing else could. You&#39;re telling me a full spec alienware or razer blade wouldn&#39;t be enough? Or even a dell Xps with a plug in gpu? Come now.
World-class YouTube video, as always. thanks for posting! :D
That notch though.... they did a great machine, why would you put that s...
I find many mac users are ignorant regarding tech and depend on companies like Apple to dumb things down for them to make the experience palatable even if you dont get a good experience because to them its the only experience they know/have.
That notch is already irritating
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m51s">9:51</a> Barack Obama (FOLLOWS YOU) the flexxxxx tho
Rip the touch bar. I remember when Apple took force touch away a few years back too. Kinda sad neither worked out, but I still prefer function keys over the touch bar and force touch was never useful enough to keep around anyways.
Amazing 🤩 I have m1 Macbook air. I want Macbook pro 14”😭
With a truly next level price.
Notch = no more nose camera for video calls
Me trying to process 760GB of RAM...
… BUT…
Tim Cook: make a top notch display <br>Designer : display with top notch 🤔

Not worth the price.
Can anyone help me if he knows that having a sony a7iii camera with a lens and an stabilizer might change my life and open up a source of income for me to live?
I feel like the design went back in time 🙁
Rich people shit


thanks i hate it lol
I&#39;m sad, I want a Mac Book Pro M1 Max
In a pinch
So they have a headphone jack in their laptops but don&#39;t have it in the phones? Wtf where is the logic behind that bullshit.

Did they fix the Bluetooth audio issue? When connecting to Bluetooth voice/mic device, all audio formats would change to a lower frequency and sound grainy.
unfortunately it does not make sense to most people to buy this machine because of how expensive it is... there are many other options that offer really good performance but for much lower of a price. but I must say, if I had the money I would buy it and I dont own any apple products.
Just received my 2021 MBP 16’ for work and have to admit, I’ll never use the new-old ports, and I miss the touch bar. It’s fast, no doubt. I absolutely love running Adobe PS/LR/Illustrator/InDesign on it, but I never minded the dongle and REALLY want the touchbar back!!!
man i need one
Remove the ports..... then give them back. There are enough fools out there
I don’t even have a Mac but I loved this video!
Who needs such trash laptops when you can buy a proper windows pc. <br>Did you know that apple is the fault for 90% of the deaths world wide, because they emit such huge radiation and co2 that our planet dies soon.<br>Apple doesn&#39;t care about you but your money, stop buying that garbage unless you want to kill our planet and humanity.
&quot;I won&#39;t even pretend to game on a Mac&quot;<br>Made my day better lmao 😂😂😂
That notch had already been the stupidest cringiest design ever for 4 generations of iphone, still they managed to make it even cringier by bringing it to the mac<br><br>Well done apple, absolute dealbreaker
Linus was just chilling :D
Will pick one up.
Apple products are so poorly designed. On this one there is no airtake or exhaust... components will die pretty quickly. I got Mac PC tower and that is like Radiator, while browsing web...
I‘m looking for a new Macbook Pro 14“ but don‘t know which model to buy, can someone help me? I‘m using it for normal tasks like surfing, YT, Twitch etc., but for Lightroom/Photoshop and sometimes Blender (3D-Program) aswell. <br>Which one would fit?
Basically, Apple took the design of a 20 old MacBook design, made the plastic casing aluminum, and got the praise of critics. Goes on to show what kind of shitty products they’ve been rolling out for the past decade, after Steve Jobs passed away. No, they had to introduce the notch to ruin it. The Apple today is run by idiots.
Nice little C2C shoutout in the video!
ugly notch
As a windows user I feel like I just lost an election by a landslide and have to concede.  Apple&#39;s new silicon is truly magical. Not running out and getting one of these today but for the first time since 2007 I am considering apple again when it comes time for me to upgrade.
This is utterly insignificant and completely off topic from this video but when you were talking about refresh rate you had Spotify open to Tetra a C2C album I haven’t thought about since it came out, and now i realise why a majority of my accounts (not this one surprisingly) uses the name Tetra<br><br>I knew it wasnt an original word but for the life of me I couldn’t remember where i first heard it
As an engineer, even one who doesn&#39;t use any apple products* I have to respect the m1 chips. For a while, improvements in CPU/GPU computing have been very incremental. The m1s are a legitimate big step forward. They&#39;re not the fastest processors in existence, but they keep up with the top tier (at least core for core in terms of CPU, GPU being a bit harder to determine with Apple&#39;s &quot;cores&#39;&quot; being a bit opaque) at fractions of the power consumption. The power draw in most (or at least many) scenarios is no more than the equivalent of between 1-3 leds (often 50% or even 25% of what an intel CPU would draw) , while still giving top tier performance. Which is crazy. Huge respect to the engineers responsible for creating these. I wish Apple was the type of company to license this kind of stuff so I could run whatever software and OS I want on these chips.<br><br>* Mostly due software... the closed ecosystem/lack of customizability, and I&#39;m not a fan of iOS or macOS
@Marques - which system do you play with?
Hi Mark it&#39;s Augustine and thanks for the detailed review. If you don&#39;t mind can you send me 14inch new Mac Book Pro to me to India. Right now I can&#39;t afford it and like when I can afford it I will send you the money back.
So that huge pelican case had retired 🎀👍
The prices are next level too this year!
AMD Ryzen ThreadRipper is Legend...
I think Apple is going back to the past for this model.
Good enough to keep for at least 5 years
The pass Marques gives to the notch is odd. The notch is an inelegant solution for webcam placement. The same consideration for it &quot;saving space for next version&#39;s Face ID&quot; would not be given to any other manufacturer who released premium hardware with a similar sized notch. Otherwise, nice review.
I would like to see a comparison between a M1 Macbook running Windows compared to the default software





Ikkkkklooooiujuiiiiikiiiukiuiiilliik

That is weird. My base model 16 inch 2021 space grey MBP came with a space grey connector for the magsafe charger. Not white like those.

Finally an actual upgrade to the 2012 Macbook Pro! Been waiting 9 years!!

I’m using a MacBook Air from 2017. I would love to get one but I don’t think I can spend the money! Maybe a previous M1 MacBook Pro. 😊

16” max is the model to go for. It’s not that much more expensive than the 14” base model by apple standards.


Missed opportunity, you should have called this video “MacBook Pro 2021: Command + Z”

Is everyone overlooking the fact that you can only connect JUST ONE external display on the new M1s?



There&#39;s a giant bug in that room.
what app marqu use for editor?

Only Apple would bring back all the ports they removed years ago and call it a feature.

you call that a huge charging brick ?

where do i get that NYC LED subway thing in the back of the shot?


Man I wish that my 3D and Video Editing skills would be better so I can have an excuse to get one of these!

I am looking forward a bit to the next Minis that have the new M1 chips.  I am not a Mac user but I do want to get into it at least a bit, and the Mini line seems to be the best way for me, what with the small form factor that I can just connect to my TV.




I want the Touch Bar back





Why they not making<br>Touch Screen Laptop ?




Just 65 GB compared to 768 GB of RAM 😂




So is about on par with AMD and Intel on performance, better on battery, much worse in gaming and 2-3x more expensive. Check the Hardware Unboxed for some comparison benchmarks.




I actually like the touch bar :/ i have the 2020 16 with an i9. the cooling is much better than the 2018 as it is thicker. but these intel chips produce so much heat it is rediculous. even with the more cooling, I would still sometimes fine my apps crashing becasue of the utilization. it is like I cant even use what I paid for just because of the design flaw.





I am not a mac guy, but this machines are getting amazing, in 1 or 2 years when all the entire mac environment apps get M1 native, the software and hardware relation will be absolutely impecable.





Man , your hand size makes everything so hard




I think I saw the groot in the background dancing....




Honestly, as a university student, the touchbar is really useful, on Microsoft Word and PowerPoint. Full of shortcuts and writing management, which made taking notes a unique experience




So you hate Windows so much that you have been packing that iMac with you? Wow.







before I see this review, I had the M1 Pro 14&quot; inch for 5 days, the battery had me on edge like Intel days, it just does not sip power the way the 2021 M1 MacBook Air does. I never worry about power with the M1 Air but I&#39;m not coding heavy stuff like that, mostly VPN with several machines running along with Virtual Box and another handful of VMs, can I get an M1 MacBook Air in a 14&quot; form factor? - to compete with the 14&quot; just released Pro, I know, probably not





A-m-a-z-i-n-g as always. intro music with this beautiful machine on display , suits it beautifully

apple fanboys: we want type c! one charger for everything!<br>also apple fanboys: we want the magsafe charger back!

Apple can make iMac finer but can&#39;t make a charger finer

As always man, awesome presentation and comparisons, great review!

macs suck and you suck for recommending them

I love Apple but I’m not buying anything with that bleeping notch in the screen..

Congratulations mate, you&#39;ve just hit 15M subscribers!

@mkbhd Am I the only who noticed M1 Pro is written twice at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m56s">16:56</a> instead of M1 Max on the second instance ?

my lenovo thinkpad fans blowing hard watching this video...smh.

Already ordered mine a month back and waiting still, will be a massive upgrade for me.

The socks and sandals bet needs to be remembered!

Those charging blocks be looking goofy af for being that big

Why do u love macs so much?

My 13&quot; M1 MBP was a game changer for me. It crushes my intel 5k iMac. I can&#39;t even imagine what these new processors will do.





Does anyone with these computers notice how typing sounds so hollow? Maybe I am used to my Macbook air.
always see a review for content creators, sad days for software developers. just saying.
I agree with the ethernet idea.
Freakin&#39; Excellent, I&#39;ve waited eight freakin&#39; years for Apple to make this laptop hanging onto my money.  Been stuck using my GTX 1070 to edit videos cause I REFUSE to fund scalpers.  Was Super Happy with my 2020 M1 MBA, this M1 Max chip is it! --Jason  🙂✌🏻❤
Instant subscribe, great content
Did you say 768GB of ram on your Mac Pro? lmao
Sounds like they were originally going to include Face ID but probably couldn’t get the parts and it was too late to change the screen notch size.
Did he say 50,000 dollars? WHAAAAA
I want that I-am-Groot thingy.
I miss the disc drive 😆
Not really a tech guy but can this M1 Pro Max be appropriate for Autodesk softwares like AEC where you&#39;re designing 3D infrastructure, for a Design Office? Otherwise great review bro!
What were they smoking when they added the notch to the Macbook. So damn ugly.
768 GB ram, are you kidding me.
Jesus Christ is Lord, dont sit down and rot in sin, no sinner is entering God&#39;s Kingdom. The flesh nature or human nature must be evacuated at the Cross not the physical cross but the Cross of Jesus Christ.
Wow that notch is freakin horrible!
Can anyone lead me to a beginner editing class lol
Ive never owned a laptop and this is the model I went with lol it ships tonight!

Do you think Apple will really make an Apple Silicon desktop? Feels like they&#39;re making their laptops powerful enough to replace the desktops.
Poor Linus getting flamed.
Who checks the BOTTOM of the laptop for sweet words? Your psychiatrist will explain OCD...
Sorry, i will not buy that hideous notch display…
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m18s">0:18</a> I thought that was a fly
If they include ethernet in power adapter, what&#39;s the point in having magsafe lol.
&quot;truly next level&quot; so is the price
I can&#39;t stand apple, but I&#39;m glad they keep Google, Samsung, windows, and Intel on their toes even though they all work together to bring you a varied of devices
I think he&#39;s in love
The hype on the apple silicone Mac Pro is overflowing. Please deliver apple.
You did not do the Craig Federighi stares at screen parody
Touchbar is really convenient for some people….i rather they add it rather than replace the existing button panel seem there is some space up there but yeah maybe it gonna compromise the chassis but I’m sure they can add supporting bar but another but is sure that will add another complexity to the manufacturing process and cost😂
Did I hear the RAM sizes correctly?
OMFG All the ppl who bought themselves that cheezgrader r crying right now…
One less Dongle
👊🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> editors or whoever putting the text in video, it reads &quot;M1 Pro&quot; but Marques is saying &quot;M1 Max&quot;.
The performance on these Mac&#39;s is insane, love this review














How many of you guys here waiting for best Windows Laptop video from Marques?
this macbook is nearly on the same level as a 50,000$ MacPro. Can you imagine that ???
I used to wear socks and sandals a lot, hey!
ok, MagSafe - why did we origginaly need it? For saving you laptop from getting pulled off the table when you accidentally pull the cable. Now you need a stronger pull to disconnect the cable, hmmm. But if you are just relaxing on the couch or in the chair with your laptop the cable will be disconnecting all the effing time as soon as it touches the surface.<br>Love this design

He trying his best to defend everything that apple did wrong.
Choosing a device is always about what apps you are gonna use and how much performance you want out of the apps. But, it&#39;s so good to see MacBook Pro finally gaining the name again.  &lt;3  Thank you MKBHD for all your videos.
Travel iMac. Something nobody has ever said before.
Repent to Jesus Christ!<br>“For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.”<br>‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m12s">4:12</a>‬ ‭NIV‬‬<br>J
I thoroughly enjoyed this video.  Glad that these laptops lived up to its expectation.  Thank you, MB! Hopefully Apple will bless us with the next M1 processor for Mac Mini sooner rather than later.

I hate that I don&#39;t need one of these.
Can&#39;t wait to see people praise the removal of ports next year
I thought there was a big ass bug on the back of the laptop at the beginning lmao
Year later they will take all the ports away again
He&#39;s trying to highlight the product but all I hear is demerits like M1 can&#39;t run engineering apps so it&#39;s not a professional laptop and they bring back ports. So my Time machine works 😂😂😂🤣
I’m sorry but I had to pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=15m30s">15:30</a> to say: do you seriously have scrolling inverted??
Got one for school haha jkjk imma sit on my regular M1 for now
Why apple is not into gaming it would have helped a lot for R and D for gaming if they were into it
let&#39;s talk price lol jeeez
love the video Marques
I bought this new 16 inch MacBook Pro M1 max. It&#39;s awesome and will be future proof👍🏻
Does m1 air still worth buying?
the touch bar was a head of its time i would get one but i will waite for the new model with the improved touch bar
This is amazing, the performance is top tier and very portable, while also quiet. Apple outdid themselves for once, still not a fan of the way Apple does business but this does shed some new light. Steve Jobs would be proud of this innovation.
I’ve watched every review of the popular tech channels this is so close to 4 million I’ll watch again haha
It still doesn&#39;t run virtual box

were is the new air did apple only expect people to buy pro units that cost thousands

RIP Intel Mac Pros
What docking station do you recommend that supports 2 monitors?

This is mah kinda mac 😌
Apple catching up? Dell XPS as a competitor uses much worse camera for ages.
I think the notch is made as wide as the bar. Not that they needed the real estate.
Thankfully this came out so the 2008 macbook pro prices lower, so then the 2008 macbook prices lower, so them the powerpook g4 prices lower, so then I can finally afford an iBook.

The extra port of a welcome move, less dongle to purchase, less e-waste, saving the environment. And it doesn’t seem like a noticeable size difference with the extra ports.

Carrying an iMac is stupid when u can just get a high end windows laptop (msi/asus) 🤦

I&#39;ve had my criticisms of Apple over the years as a company. But these new M chips and what they able to do is extremely impressive.
Hey, a question to anyone who can help: Would it be better to buy 14‘‘ M1Pro 8 Core CPU / 14 Core GPU with 32GB RAM or 14‘‘ M1Pro 10 Core CPU / 16 Core CPU with 16 GB RAM. Which one is more future-proof, both upgrades together (RAM+Chip) are probably too expensive for me. Use cases are creative work, school and the usual daily tasks (media consumption, etc.) and I‘d like to keep this laptop for at least 6 years without any major perfomance issues. (My current HP laptop has lasted me about 7-8 years, but it‘s had bigger issues for about 3 years now)

Awesome

wtf
PC world needs a new MacBook killer hopefully it&#39;s from Razer
Man if only Revit would natively run on macOS… This would be the one!
Awesome review, dragging the travel Mac Pro must have caused you some grief at airports!
Apple, The Mcdonalds of electronics. Rip off!


This is the best laptop that they have made in literally years!

LOL Anyone else still using a Early 2008 MBP like me?   Video coming out later this year.
IT&#39;s like Apple made a laptop JUST for Marques.

As a college student, should I save up and buy the 14 inch macbook or is it worth going for the cheaper options? Basically what is the best macbook for college students?

Kinda disappointing that these nearly £3000 laptops don&#39;t feature the highest quality and the newest ports... Like it is weird considering the price tag... Apple used to always be on the cutting edge but now they&#39;re happy with old generation tech and tools in their products yet they remain the most expensive ones on the market

Oh wow, the MAC just catched up too a 2018 high-end spec PC...  It even have ports now? OMG.

Waiting to nvidia to do the same, they just need those arm cpu cores...
Why did i buy the M1 MacBook Pro in april :(





كحل كحل بو جميلة 😂🙄
Rest in Peace Intel... <br><br>These chips should open the door for more gaming on future Macs ... if the developers can recognize the power and potenital.





Marques sounds both Happy and Excited at the same time!
So, &quot;this is not the first mini LED display&quot;, &quot;this is not the first HDR laptop&quot; and &quot;it&#39;s defiantly not the first high refresh rate screen in a laptop&quot;....But still 90% of all laptops you review are Macbooks....Why is that? Apple is not everything even though you can clearly see that those videos that have most views on average are about Apple products. You could only congratulate Apple that they have built such strong brand but it would be nice to see some more laptops videos from brands such as HP, MSI, ASUS, SAMSUNG etc :)
Bruh the gun in the thumbnail is a m16 not a m4a1





Space grey magsafe really would be a nice touch! Maybe Apple will take note.




yeah, it&#39;s literally &quot;top-notch design&quot; ;-)




WHEAT AND RICE WILL ALWAYS WIN OVER DIAMONDS, BUT BUYING WHEAT AT A COST OF DIAMONDS DOESN&#39;T MAKES SENSE.




My family needs a computer badly. I’ve never had an apple computer





you think they are going to release a macboock air
Guy at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m57s">18:57</a> has on the Squid Games outfit




Digital foundry is no more, spread the word





Me, watching this rendering tests in my Macbook Air 2020, the last Intel i3 specimen 🤡





MBP 16”<br><br>Silver vs Space Grey !?





LOL! So &quot;PRO&quot;! NOTTT!!!<br>HAHAHA That notch in the middle of the screen! <br>And HDMI 2.0?! <br>How Stupid!




How does the performance look if you have McAfee installed on your machine?





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m38s">12:38</a> that lid looks bent af, which would be a massive quality control issue at this pricepoint!
This interesting,and I am sure I will be trolled severely by the Apple fan fanatics after this comment.<br>However, I have been &quot;upgraded&quot; at work to all the latest 2021 Apple infrastructure, My comment for what it&#39;s worth is for what you pay for you should be getting a cutting  edge computer infrastructure Instead you get a controlling eclectic  sometimes backward looking software and hardware system .





Hey guys I stopped at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=13m02s">13:02</a> when he says &#39;spoiler alert&#39;. Where do I pick back up. I&#39;ll be waiting here.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m10s">9:10</a>
Ppl gotta gtf over the notch, it takes up no screen real estate, if you’re complaining about that, you’re just complaining for fun.




Seems they went with a wider than needed notch from the start so that when they add FaceID next year they don&#39;t have to deal with making the notch wider and people moaning about it and software needing to be updated <i>again</i> to support two different size notches. That is my speculation anyway.<br><br>Truth is nobody <i>wants</i> a notch but with the macOS menubar UI design it can/should work well (once apps are updated, etc.). It is better than the bezel that was there before it. If you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t buy it 🤷‍♂️



My 14 inch arriving in 3 days!!!!! Can&#39;t wait to see it
nothign will ever make me go to macos

wwooowww
going backwards is what helps Apple move forward with upgrades to their new products.  I thought you knew tho.


Intro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥


lol, after I settled down over the switch to USB C I was pissed that the headphone jack moved to the right side. Like I needed a cord poking my mouse hand.<br><br>This is basically the 2015 jacked up.<br><br>But why is it so much thicker?

Bro we want a review sony xperia pro i 🙄
So, finally 60fps HDR video?


I swear that&#39;s a raven cawing sample in the music intro.
Very few ports, they only work &quot;in a pinch&quot;, a giant gouge at the top center of the screen, the function key being in the wrong spot (needs to be swapped with the ctrl key); yeah sign me up. Not.


that is the cleanest intro ive ever seen wtf


accidently played the into track channels music as the background for the review, it was a good mistake.


I switched from Window Laptop to Macbook Pro M1 because of battery life, how incredible it is this laptop can last a day with my regular tasks without performance trade-off.


editing is nice


Wouldn&#39;t it be really cool if the 32GB ones were actually available in the US?  But they&#39;re not.  Thank GOD they solder the RAM into the board, without the option to upgrade RAM.  APPLE!



Macbook for Enthusiasts People


Ya, hard to notice what’s in front of you…


usb c charging is pretty great, the only reason i ended my mbp 2012 was the mag safe dying


You literally travel to events with a desktop computer? Have you ever done this type of comparison with Windows of any sort? Because in the gaming world, you need high power high performance great graphics cards, and because of that you can import export so quickly with great performance. Why don&#39;t you just use gaming computers? And can you do a video on that? You don&#39;t need to just be a gamer to have a gaming computer. They have performance that I have yet to see on a normal desktop or laptop. That&#39;s what I&#39;m searching for, a computer that has the performance of a gaming computer without being labeled a &quot;gaming computer.&quot;

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m17s">0:17</a> I tried to catch the flies on the screen

Not gonna lie, the new MBP&#39;s are so good I&#39;m looking for an excuse why I need one. So far unsuccessfully but I will find one, even if it means picking up a new hobby. :D


RIP travel iMac...


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m21s">16:21</a> M1 Max <b>only</b> has 64 gigs of RAM.


One less dongle...
We love watching things that we can&#39;t buy<br>-Rob jobs
the next one will have a cd 😂


Marques,you do realize this can replace your Mac Pro



Yo is the blind 2021 camera test incoming?


So after all that<br>.. Can we play games on it? Like any game at high end quality

@Marques Brownlee One guy is sending message saying you are selected as winner. Please check with your team who is he.

I can&#39;t stop watching these types of videos even though I can&#39;t afford any of these gadgets

&quot;The mouse goes underneath it&quot;<br>Finally inner peace 😌

Old and slower SD card slot, no ethernet port on charging brick but still it&#39;s a Pro 😌😌

Pretty awful &quot;review&quot;. No mention of any of the negatives, this is just an advertisement.<br><br>Can I upgrade my ram? Or at least my SSD in 4,5 years when I&#39;m using it differently than what I need it for today? It&#39;s a crazy expensive laptop, don&#39;t expect me to buy a new one every 3 years because I decide I need more ram. IT&quot;S A PRO VERSION, COME ON!!! What&#39;s the dpm rate (dongles per square meter) in my house going to be like? If I invest $3000+ on this, how many years will it last until the screen starts flickering and they tell me I have to buy a new one, 2, 3 years?  What is Apple&#39;s stance on fixing their mistakes? (I know the answer: they pretend nothing is wrong until it&#39;s so bad it enters mainstream media, then they offer a limited free repair program). What will be the reparability score? <br><br>This is a great advert for these pretty things, but MKBHD fails to mention ANY of the downsides... that&#39;s terrible &quot;reviewing&quot; and why I call it an advert. Sure, it gives me faster processing for a while (until intel starts shipping their 10 or 7 nm), and longer battery (well for the first year, how much to change that in 2 years?). But in 3 years there will be intel laptops as fast as this, at half the price, is it worth investing in this now? These are all things a reviewer would mention and discuss.  <br><br>The laptop may be powerful, but it&#39;s built for the top 1% who can afford throwing it away as if global warming isn&#39;t a thing and buy a new one every few years.

I have anxiously been waiting for this video and i think i underestimated how much marques opinion actually matters to me

which video editor you used in intro of this video

After so many days he just puts few slides and hardly used that laptop. I didn’t like this review. But still I am not disliking this but giving like for future. 👍🏼

I can&#39;t believe this isn&#39;t extremely obvious to anyone complaining, but the notch is there to make you buy the next one coming out without the notch in 3 or 4 years. They made this &quot;great&quot; laptop that reintroduced features lost nearly 10 years ago to make people upgrade. But they have to leave people wanting more. It&#39;s marketing. Imagine buying a laptop and being completely 100% happy with it and using it for 10 years. Horrible for Apple.

I watched every one of your new videos
Hay I did the tweet <br>Realise me<br>I am inisant

While I’m quietly using my mid 2012 retina Mac thinking it’s top shit 💀💀

Bekar laptop

I’ve used normal pc windows laptops my whole life and I’ve never had to buy a dongle….

What were you looking at 🤨🤔

Can we play basic games like dotta?

Incredible

I would prefer the Alienware Area 51m2

The extra port of a welcome move, less dongle to purchase, less e-waste, saving the environment. And it doesn’t seem like a noticeable size difference with the extra ports.

please make a separate video for the everyday users. fomo is real.

It does exactly what Apple advertises: quiet.

Marques are you ever going to do a giveaway? :(

Next level but can&#39;t run games. Yeah nah

Wondering if still having that 2-3 seconds of lack when waking up from sleep mode / login screen. Or if wifi again still having connection issues when waking up from sleep mode.


I can&#39;t believe a notch is in the middle. Why can it be on the side, bottom,flip up? Who uses the camera on a laptop?

They probably run Minecraft on 30 fps still 😭

Intro song/music: Calling Crows (feat. 20syl &amp; Mr. J. Medeiros) Instrumental

Amazing so the notch wasn’t enough on the iPhone now they are extending it all the way to other products. Maybe next year we will get a watch with a notch who knows?! Please don’t tell anything about stretching the screen or any of these BS’s! It’s an ugly notch ok

Even I have seen dozen of video about this, I still like to see full video of this

I will probably never own a Mac but I have to give them props where it is due. They really upped their game this generation.

its a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> ratio anyway so the top part of the screen blacking out is actually referable

Hi Marques, could you please interview Jonathan Blow re software performance matter?

90% of consumers don&#39;t need these high spec&#39;d devices. Save your money.

So basically this is an upgraded version of my &quot;MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013)&quot; laptop. literally everything you said is exactly what I have right now, but upgraded specs and hardware.<br><br>literally every feature you said, is EXACTLY what i have in front of me.<br><br>Glaf to hear apple is finally giving the people what the people want, and not what apple wants them to have.

Socks and sandles like Linus

They put the notch now so they can make it smaller and smaller  then remove  it on the next releases. Then they would call it revolutionary. Typical money making apple

Marques, are you getting your hands on SONY XPERIA PRO-I ?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m51s">3:51</a> Let me color correct &amp; grade this Log footage for you 😉😀

The dislikes are from Intel and Microsoft employees who can’t keep up with the good times

I wonder how good this is on audio units plugins.

I wanted a laptop with 16 inch mac , with all day battery life but not that kind of power , having to read and write u need extra screen space , so a less powerfull 16 inch with latest m1 could have been an option for apple . I wish an option for 1500 $ space existed .

same spec 14 and 16 any difference?

The intro is 🔥🔥🔥

I just feel like I can trust this guy....


Winning 🏆<br>Great review bruh👍🏿

lol top &quot;notch&quot; design

I don&#39;t care windows is the boss of all! 😎😎😎🤞

ɴɪᴄᴇ

why did they give the macbooks a notch 🤮🤮🤮🤮

I don&#39;t own a Mac Book or any other variant and i don&#39;t plan to in the near future, but his reviews are so satisfying


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m44s">8:44</a> - What is that on the right hand side of the screen?  Is it what I think it is?


the others will drown in hydrogen, China thanks the west for continued orders, and our 2nd of 3 Giga going up, faster than Giga 1, unstoppable to 3T valuation in 12 months


Make a video on Varjo XR 3. Try it, your mind will be blown.

the notch tho.. it&#39;s actually laughable. why would they include it??

I am happy that I can charge from either side w usb c... that was nice... my prev laptops only had 1 side charging.... that sucked.

is nvida back?

The tune in the beginning!! It.. It threw me somewhere.. somewhere back in time like 2015 or something

Why file manager is not Working in poco m2 pro

I want a CD3217 :(


The notch is hideous

Idiots brought back the ports and magsafe.  Wtf were they thinking in the first place.  What was the point of all that???
Fuuuuuuck apple.   Gonna get another maxed out 2015 , thanks

Haha... I occasionally wear socks and sandals for no reason.

The people writing GCC (the ubiquitous C compiler for most CPUs) are probably having a <b>fun</b> time trying to figure out the innards of this M1 chip.<br><br>These issues make Apple laptops scary in a bigger picture; the war on general-purpose computing. You’ll get efficiency and performance, but at the cost of having all processors be a black-box to the tinkerers, and to that logical end, the users that plan to use it for other things. <br><br>The Apple *appliance*, not computer, is nigh. It’ll be called the AMS - the Apple Media System, since it will do nothing BUT what Apple wants it to do.

I wonder how Apple would feel about this review with a Pixel 6 Pro in the shot <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m45s">16:45</a>

Don’t think he mentioned it specifically but I think it’s safe to say he went the 8TB SSD route…

Just got a stacked m1 2020 mbp this summer and I should&#39;ve waited lol. Guess that&#39;s what apple does. Think different?

Is it just me to be shocked by the 768 GB of Ram :D in the Mac Pro :D :D

To me it will only be mind blowing if I can put Linux as the main OS on it 😂

As an engineer, there&#39;s nothing more I&#39;d want more than being able to run all the software I use on a machine like this. Unfortunately Mac OS is the real limit here and virtual machines cannot take advantage of such amazing power.

Man wish i could afford one they both look amazing.

Your promotion and worship of technology is killing the planet and leading to the downfall of mankind enjoy your money one day you will face the consequences for your blind worship

0,001% of people need that much performance

Celebration of the mundane

I still want the 11inch macbook air back.

I&#39;m an intermediate nature and wildlife photographer. I used videos a lot in my digital storytelling. I&#39;ve been reluctant to buy an Apple laptop because of their lackluster customer service at times. Do you think it&#39;s a good buy for someone like me? <br><br>I absolutely enjoy your thoughtful advice and reviews.



Can&#39;t wait for...Introducing the Apple M1 Garand

Off topic here, but where did you get that shirt? Also, thanks for the review.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m30s">16:30</a> 768 gigs of ram……. That computer has 3x as much ram as I have HD space.





This video had me at the Apple Store with cash in hand before I could even finish it lmao




Badly want to have one, but I&#39;m a poor scholar 😔






The “top notch“ is a funny one ☝🏻



Can you please review M1 MacBook Air?





Am I the only person that uses premier pro on MacOS?




Absolutely Great Video. <br>But I just want to say that Thumbnail could’ve been better. Don’t know why.




Maybe the notch is that big to accommodate future hardware.


Will this run fine with me browsing reddit, checking my email, and using sales force at the same time?
i7




Review the Pro 14”




Lol u couldn&#39;t find a replacement for the travel imac and making videos? Really?<br><br>U should take a closer look at the internet 🤣😅





Does that mean the 14 inch charges at the same speed whether it’s mag safe or USB-C?





Still no USB’s with their new laptops? Fuck you apple
I just don&#39;t like the way it looks.<br>Looking like a Dell<br>Plus although touchbar was of not much use but still it made the mac look a little premium <br>This new pro looks pretty cheap although it has this new wonderful processor





So, I cheat. I have a M1 Mac Mini that I game on with Stadia... lol but shit it works and works well!

Can you take the 140 watts charger with you on a plane?


I&#39;ve been itching for this review! I picked up the 14&quot; specced out and December can&#39;t come soon enough!


This computer is good, in a pinch.


Someone please help me! I am buying the base model 16” with 1 TB SSD. But I’m confused whether I should upgrade the ram to 32gb. I do 4K video editing, photo editing and am learning music production. I’m already spending above my budget. But I really want the device to last long as well! So please help me! I am so damn confused! Thanks🖤


Hi ! Where did you find that baby Groot ?!!


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m50s">9:50</a> Casual &quot;Barrack Obama follows you&quot; flex


Thanks for this great video. based off your experience with the video editing which Macbook is equal to or better than an iMac Pro 10 core with Vega 64 16g and 64gigs of ram? Im a bit worried about the GFX performance on these laptops.


Why not just leave a powerful pc at your office or home and then connect to it with a less powerful laptop?


How’s those checks from apple going ? Considering you are literally the only person or tech person in history to say anything great about these CPUs


so we buy laptops to make videos about laptops...interesting


Can i play Fortnite on it? LoL


i just feel happy for the apple engineers seeing this and feeling validated


It looks kind of vintage and I love it! Thats why I went for silver because its just got that old school feel


The first time in my life I actually want one they did something right here if me a Windows and premiere pro user wants one that is a audio head


Zero To One.


Good point about previously having to lug iMac. This is exactly what I want it to be compared with. I myself have been frustrated and had thought seriously about lugging my iMac(the need for a  good lightweight but rugged case). Good to know M1 MacBook can replace that! In fact the loaded MacBook I just ordered has more Disk space(8TB) than my desktop now(4TB)!


Spending that much money on a laptop is out of question for me. I&#39;d rather build an amazing, outta this world Windows PC for the price of the 14&quot; Macbook pro. The only worthwhile Apple product is the iPhone.


I don&#39;t believe you. Please, tell me why, geekbench, in one previous version, benchmarks the same computer HIGHER than the latest version of that SAME computer. Its CAP!


Oh yeh...just let me sell my car to buy a laptop who can barelly launch high end app


haha nice he uses Beyerdynamics Headphones :) ^.^


My god the notch is such an eyesore


I&#39;m sorry... 768 gigs of ram?


@marques brownlee do you recommend the macbook pro for someone who uses it primarily for studying and writing? Or does the macbook air m1 suffice?


Is it just me, or is the audio out of sync with the video? I checked on TV, laptop and phone and it appeared to be out on all so not necessarily a buffer or device type of an issue.


You didn&#39;t hear fans while exporting, because there are no fans, I guess


It’s a bit more than a tool and more personal than that for most people. My whole life is on my laptop. I think only second  to my  mobile phone.


The M1 MacBook cannot perform Bootcamp correct?


They couldn&#39;t round out the front edge? <br>My wrists !


i saw it in the store and was kinda blown away before I saw this video


So Apple couldn’t just add the TouchBar above the Function keys, or give you the option to purchase the MacBook Pro with Function Keys or with the TouchBar?


Great review man


You should review Dell XPS and Samsung Galaxy Book too. Hard not to look biased when you only review PCs and Tablets made by Apple. Even your Surface coverage is limited.


Is it possible to get final cut on windows? I mean is there anything like parallels for Windows to run Mac apps on windows? Experts, please help.



So if a person doesn&#39;t edit videos this expensive laptop is pretty much useless...ports are back and people are celebrating? This is so confusing to me 🤣🤣🤣


I see you <b>Groot</b>


What does he use to edit videos?<br>Would love to know.


Can&#39;t wait for the socks and sandals.




That was very objective 🤔




768 gigs of RAMMMMMMMM





Would be nice if they&#39;d bring that headphone jack to iPhones.


Next lvl price


I think the notch and other design decisions are due to this be a low-volume product for Apple. There is definitely a possibility that they expect demand to be short of the panel amount they expect from their OEM(s) so they leave room for the larger/grater number of sensors they&#39;ll need in the future. Otherwise it&#39;s simply they want to say in the next gen - &quot;We got rid of the notch&quot; - which will likely be after Apple weighs all the price/performance/monetary returns they can before they make a decision. The PRO line likely sells in very small number, introducing the notch now, likely is a move to decrease acceptance in the future, and help ensure panel supplies can be maintained.


Oyyeeee oyeeee oyyeee that intro !! Seriously!!!


Just bought my first Macbook Pro (mid-2012) a few month ago. Can&#39;t wait to buy one of these in 8-9 years from now when the price will be much more affordable to me.





wow ports! what a feature!


some dangle for rango


Just remove the notch.




I am so excited to own one of these , I&#39;ll buy one of these in 2030 may be but 2035 for sure





&quot;Three minutes. And forty nine seconds. Jesus.&quot;


A notch??!! LOL




The new M1 pro and max MacBook Pro&#39;s look more like the titanium powerbook than the aluminum one, and i think i know why they look so similar, its a tribute to the world&#39;s first widescreen laptop. The titanium powerbook whas launched in 2001, so exact 20 years later ;)





Please do gift me one please







well in reality every single next macbook is next level compare to a previous model of a macbook





Imagine your two to four thousand dollar laptop beating out your $50,000 desktop...even if it&#39;s not in every area, for the M1 Macs to even compare to the Mac Pros is insane. Further showing that the desktop versions of Apple&#39;s silicon are going to be INSANE





Hey ...<br><br>I request everyone who sees this comment to report the account which has Marques&#39;s profile asking people to WhatsApp a number under the &quot;Unwanted commercial content or spam&quot; category . Please report it so that YouTube actually sees it

Why is every Mac computer perfectly suited for MKBHd ?


I bought Mac pro 2 month ago.I just want to say Ffffuuuuuccc…


What if some app has more navigation items? Won&#39;t some of the nav items hide behind top notch?


Let&#39;s see what the Apple Fanboy has to say.


final cut timelines are so messy!


Looks over at my wallet. sorry buddy 😅😅


If you were to only watch Marques, you’d think the notch was the single biggest issue facing humanity.


No one will trust and believe you guys anymore since you shake hands with Bill Gates and the rest. Period!


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=11m30s">11:30</a> i love to see this in a standard monitor.. my LG monitor has room for a good webcam... can&#39;t wait to see this in other monitors as well.


Apple brought desktops to the world, it&#39;s time they replace it completely with laptops.


It is sad that 90% of these machines will be used for emails and spreadsheets only.

How come no one is mentioning the fact that these new Macbooks are now in what appears to be a cheap plastic shell vs. the aluminum body that the previous Macbooks had? Yes, better performance - but much cheaper looking product and I&#39;m sure WAY less expensive for Apple to produce. The premium look and feel is gone, and the price is higher.





MKBHD: smallest machine that I could take with me<br>also MKBHD: throws it in a big ass case thingy





just a quick wish can you just start making some videos on editing the videos i’ll be greatfull





how many external monitors can they support?






Imagine designing this next level M1 chip and then someone in the aesthetic design department decides to add a gigantic notch to the screen
Reviewing a MacBook with a Google pixel 6 in hands





did u just say 700gb of ram?





sri lanka


I am the one who really need that but don&#39;t have money. Sadly.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m11s">0:11</a> transition so smooth ended no nut November


Twitter review is next right 😁


amazing intro!!


GREAT ADVERTISING 😂😂😂😂😂


Another brainless apple fanboy review.


aespa has rotten my brain with how many times this dudes been saying next level


Can&#39;t wait to see Marques wearing sandals &amp; socks 😂


this is the first time in a while I&#39;m interested in a MacBook! I wonder if there&#39;s going to be a giveaway soon hihi


It looks outdated


@MKBHD You do not do any laptop/PC reviews except that of Apple&#39;s/Microsoft&#39;s (Just only the recent one) laptop/PC products. Why must your reviews/impressions on laptops need to be cared or watched at all? You simply don&#39;t have any expertise or sample size to spread out any word or pass any judgement at all. If you simply wanna do review the computers that only you would eventually use, do it away, but do not pass on any comparitive judgements on laptops for god&#39;s sake! Your laptop workloads (or Linus&#39;, or any other non-professional YouTubers&#39;) is not notworthy or talk-worthy. Making videos and playing games is not the computing workload that is running the world.



“A new top notch design” 😒


Apple: The ports are back!<br>Me: Yay! Now I can finally get a Mac that I can plug flash drives into without needing an adapter again!<br>Apple: Haha, NOPE!









Apple: introducing the MacPro desktop<br><br>MKBHD: where is my travelling case?


Happy to know that you are a marvel fan!



Now my brain hurts 😂 after seeing such a review with so much depth


Of course Apple doesn’t give you the latest port versions 😂 so typical.


But what about handling more than one monitor in non-mirror mode?


A next level rip-off for all these blind apple fans for sure....


Too bad I read about a lot of issues with Logic Pro on the new chips. Makes me not want to upgrade.


I want to be an Apple developer someday. I&#39;m just 17 so I couldn&#39;t afford any Apple product, ever in my life. It&#39;s hard to think that someone actually has every gadgets he/she wants. I wish I could have that M1 Max someday.


Until next year then this will be forgot about..


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m17s">20:17</a> Marques Brownlee try to conclude this review in one reaction 😂
Spec for spec I think I pulled a difference of about £100 between the 14 and 16 inch m1 max, that was the deciding push for me to go 16” plus it’s always nicer to edit on a bigger screen.
An M1 Ipad Pro 13&quot; vs Mac Book Air video would be simply amazing!
I think that you are paid for those videos, everything is next level, for me not.
That was such a good review. Not a single second wasted.


The chip shortage meant they had to use old ports! Sold as feature! HDMI 2? REALLY?
But
I don&#39;t know why you keep saying &quot;it&#39;s just a tool&quot;.  Of course it&#39;s just a tool.  All the gadgets reviewed on the channel are tools.  Is the Macbook supposed more a &quot;tool&quot; than other stuff you review???
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> it should read M1 Max MBP. Excellent review as always 👊🏼
You gotta love how Marques spouts off these use cases that are like niche as balls for the majority of users. His videos look good but you have to love how he name drops his 8K cameras every chance he gets.

unpopular opinion - they look hideous.
The biggest ouucch with all of this&#39; is to Intel that literally is being manhandled as a silicon company that are being run over by foreign silicon companies and getting their pants pulled down.<br>- and to all the apple fanbois.. Apple don&#39;t make these silicone chips.. Taiwan does (TSMC).<br>production are pretty much all outsourced away from the USA. <br>Same with all these Apple products, like Ipad pro, Macbook16, Ipad Pro tower; Apple watch etc, and likely also this Macbookpro, though Apple are not glad to inform it... but these Apple-products are usually made by Quanta (a Taiwanese computer maker)... and sure Quanta makes gorgeous aluproducts.. got a few myself.. like Porsche Book.. that according to Microsoft CEO was a co&#39;align between four players..Quanta, Wacom, Porsche Design, and Microsoft.<br>and I reckon your last prez.. Trump likely also noticed the undermining dangers of outsourcing all and everything to other regions with his &quot;USA-first campaign&quot;, but the USA are starting to wake up, and Taiwanese semiconductor TSMC are in the process of building silicone plant on US-soil, just as the rest of the world are realizing how dangerous it is to have one company like TSMC that are placed in a turmoil-region like Taiwan (with huge tensions with China) be the worlds semiconductor supplier, and how easy it is to tumble with shortage &amp; likewise&#39; when your getting so much from one source.<br>Hopefully, politicians here in Scandinavia will also take notice, that you cant just outsource&#39; like there is no tomorrow..<br>But very impressive the performance in this new-gen of MacBookPro&#39;s.. 5.42m on a leveraged Mac pro.. and close to 2 minutes faster on the M1 Max in a freeking laptop... obviously not painting a true picture of the full compute balance, but that a battery-based laptop influenced by a certain power limit, can even play along with a beefed-up Mac Pro on AC, is quite impressive-
768GB of RAM😩….Why Marques
muy buen video.
When I see a frigg&#39;n notch on my iMac, that&#39;s when it goes in the round file.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m53s">7:53</a> lmao Veritasium&#39;s vid
Not 4k, not Oled, ugly notch, fail
office.
Why does he pronounce it “silikin”. It’s siloCONE. Amiright??

These things are putting up wild performance numbers in X Plane 11. This is a big deal since high end graphics cards are so hard to get right now. When a 2080 Ti costs $2500, suddenly a $3600 laptop is reasonable.





We would love a review on Sony Xperia Pro I
camera notch in the screen lmao..they always do something to make you want the next version. trash

Subtitles incorrect at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m08s">17:08</a>; Assuming it should&#39;ve stated &quot;M1 MAX MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>&quot;... was confused for a second.
As someone who&#39;s almost hated Apple for their marketing tactics, removal of stuff from their devices (even their packaging boxes), their closed wall &quot;ecosystem&quot; and what not, <br>but after looking at these new Mac Book Pros, I&#39;m seriously considering them.
The M1 Max is sweet, but I&#39;d never be willing to pay that much for one of these laptops.

Apple can make people so broke
calling crows in!!!!!! awesome stuff coming !!!
99% don’t need this. People buy brand new high end Macs to take notes lmao


watching from my i3 dell 4gb ram aptop is a vibbeeeeeee


I had high hopes when I saw the specs but in action, it handle the overload, with the same price on the high-end M1 Max 16 inch model I can get a full-fledged gaming laptop with more power plus $1300 cheaper.


nah man dont beleave you as soon as the desktop comes out you wont be using this to edit 100% confirmed


MSI GE76
I mean, we all saw this coming.  Apple going back to what they removed.  And getting rid of the stupid touchbar.
Can&#39;t run windows x64 VMs which is the major draw back. I might have to wait until Microsoft makes the shift.  The shift will be coming in my opinion.  RISC is such a huge deal.
hey marques, i dont think you noticed but at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m06s">17:06</a>, you made an error with the floating text on the right, the third line should read: &quot;M1 Max MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>&quot;


I’m sorry Apple but that is one ugly all around MacBook miss that Jony Ive touch to design.


Casual 768GB of RAM in the Mac Pro, lol xD


I don&#39;t have money but I watch every video.🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳


I have been following you from way back. But for the past 2-3 years, you&#39;ve become more like an apple endorser and less of an honest reviewer. It&#39;s really sad to see you drifting away. <br>I really enjoy your content. But it has become a let down for your review contents.


Anyone can confirm if it is 8bits or 10 bits display, other blogger states it is 8 bits and I can’t find on Apple site!


video on the GMMK Pro coming??


APPLE 2018: People don&#39;t know what they want...they don&#39;t need headphone jacks they must buy our Apple bluetooth earphones. Why use USB and HDMI ports when they can use our Thunderport? SD Card slot sucks, we&#39;ll force our customers to buy our pricey cloud storage. If they still want these ports, we&#39;ll sell them our dongles.<br><br>APPLE 2021: Our new M1 Macbooks have ports now.


anyone who uses iStats will probably hate the notch


The audio seems to be like a microsecond off and I actually notice it.


Macintosh fans starting to have computers worth their grain of salt...


Apple silicon Mac Pro desktop? Wouldn’t that go against everything folks wanted a desktop Mac to be? Meaning, you would never be able to upgrade it


I&#39;m just pissed off they brought back ports that were on older Macbook Pros that shouldn&#39;t have been dumped frankly.  So now, they&#39;re bringing back some ports and saying it&#39;s new? F*** that! Oh, and the brought back the old style keyboard? F*** that even more! And the Magsafe is back? *&amp;^&amp;(%*&amp;)*&amp;!!


If the new laptop is that capable, then just imagine what the new Mac Pro will be able to do when it comes out.


They basically went back to their old basic model and called it new


No thanks, no face id.. mean to be traced by tech or government. I have a pixel 4xl and has never used face id. Not planning to use it never.


The new thicc mbp is finally MKBHD certified. You can’t go wrong with either one of this.


The quick note with Monterey is super annoying to me because when I watch full screen on here (YT) I use the mouse to exit and not the keyboard


Marcus! Wondering if you know when we can expect something like this in the desktop version....


You just gave apple a reason to keep notching 😂


Top notch I see what you did there


I am waiting next generation to have no notch and faceID. I have the last mbp i9 32gb and right now it does everything i need ( some a little slow but its ok right now ) so i can wait a little.


And here I&#39;m still using an Acer google chrome, from 2014. Ahaha. 🤣


What are your exact specs for your 16in?


Imagine if you could game in that thing.  If only


I made the switch to Affinity Design programs when I got my 16 MBP M1Pro a week ago and everything is absolutely instant, Can&#39;t wait to mess around with some video editing.



I JUST DROPPED 3 600 on a Max Pro. After having it for a week, its very nice, obviously fast, but just doesn&#39;t feel like a 3 600 machine. Returning it.


People really are annoying complaining about the notch, why the hell are you looking at it instead of the actual screen? It really isn&#39;t that big of a deal


Better be them Jesus 3’s sandals. Slides don’t count we all do that in college


Any recommendations on what laptop, tablet etc I should buy? I&#39;m looking to use Adobe illustrator to make stickers. And also looking to draw on the screen. I can settle for a separate drawing pad compatible to a Laptop thanks!


Did he say 768g ram ? I don&#39;t have this much storage man


May I just say that every time Marques releases a video they get incrementally better? Editing, effects, and I&#39;m sure scripting and the effort put into each one has just gone through the roof.<br><br>I can always count on coming back to this man and never ceasing to be blown away  🤯


...no


No M1 Pro review??


Subtle pixel flex for the notes. So silky smooth MKBHT!! haha


Only God knew what He was doing when He made &quot;The Notch&quot;.  LOL


NEXT next level would be making the trackpad an iphone screen with apple pen support


May be the new feet will actually stay stuck on the bottom of the case now? Does the leading edge cut into your wrists just like the old Alu &amp; Unibodies? Why not an L-shaped Magsafe though?


That&#39;s NOT a headphone jack. Why does EVERY YouTuber not know the difference between a jack and a port. Its that hard? 🤷‍♂️


Currently watching this on my M1 Pro MacBook Pro :)


iem audiophiles had no problem before. shures bb


Apple decided they made enough money from dongles I guess


Great review. I missed seeing WHAT we can do with the stuff that gets LEFT BEHIND after the great upgrades to M1 MAX. After all WE spent AS much if not more on those now we leave behinddd. ANY WAY of seeing a good video of how we can really UPGRADE or repurpose those, or is that not worth it anymore??


It&#39;s so weird, it&#39;s like they literally brought old ports from their old computers and literally slapped them on here, like to clear old stock, I&#39;m betting the next update will have modern ports.


No usb? How do I plug in my interface?


My man just said 768gb of ram. Tf


Awesome video, Marques. They’re a lot of money, but for a pro Apple finally made a pro machine.


It says &quot;2021&quot; on the computer but your shirt says &#39;19. Something fishy is going on here. Hahaha. Jk 😜







a notch on a laptop? So stupid.


macbook air review????


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m32s">20:32</a> are the flickering on the screen the local dimming stuff?


Of topic I’m from Uk and I can’t buy Mac pro with M1 32 ram. Non existent in entire country. Is apple the biggest company producing tech products what sham and embarrassing. I can’t believe not even one laptop in the uk. Fracking hell


Saw this guy before and u can trust him on the all reviews <br>Telling the right things good or bad in way how it is no + - just straight.Regard Buddy Ur the Best forget the rest


Won&#39;t lie those look like amazing ! If a guy like him say &quot;next level&quot; something must be going on with M1...

This is whatsup. I could rock one of these for the next 8 years easily.

They should have done what dell XPS 13 did, create a very thin top bezel

WHY IS THERE A DAMN NOTCH DANG IT

Did he just say 768gb of ram?

Long Term Review and Update.  I have a 2013 MacBook Pro 14” screen that lives in my truck.  I own a custom home building company and use this little computer pretty often but not all the time.  I live in Texas so the computer in sleep mode lives under the back see in my truck.  The battery maintains a charge even if it’s back there for a couple weeks.  This has been the very best computer of all time.  I really can’t say enough good about it.  My work load obviously isn’t building apps or making YouTube videos but mainly email, pulling up and marking up blueprints, texting and so on.  This thing has been bulletproof.  Put it this way it has outlasted the three trucks it’s lived in over the last 7+ years.

Am I the only person that is geeked that he said His Mac Desktop has 186 Gigs of ram??? 😅😲 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m23s">16:23</a>


king of intros

A « Pro Max review »

I feel Apple made a mistake by changing the tapered edges for sake of change. My new 2021 16” MacBook Pro M1 Max Space Gray kind of looks like an older IBM ThinkPad. I do not like the boxy sides and flat top. Plus, without the bottom taper, it’s actually more difficult to pick up since your fingers cannot get under it. Otherwise I’m happy with all the other upgrades and improvements.


If you are using SD or HDMI card slot in 2021 you are not a pro. They are mainstream ports that people like.


Will you do the new pro beats video ?



how does he get the cursor to move that smooth?


DAMN I could waited for this model😭 i bought pro 2020 few months ago


cool

Apple&#39;s motto. To make things better we will make them worse and then put everything back where it was. Progress!

GOD I wish I could afford this

The notch, magsafe, the heaviness of the hinge (needs two hands to open if it&#39;s like older Macbooks), and MacOS in general are very unappetizing. Cool otherwise. Love the removal of the touch bar and the added ports, even if they skimped on the port specs, and obviously the processor looks awesome.

So the 50,000 Mac is now useless

Just make that top taskbar black and problem solved.

Dude to u donate your old macbooks i would love a 2017

So why cant apple make both Function Keys as well as Touch Bar together in one laptop ? ?

My hypothesis: newer Mac book pros will have Face ID. Face ID will require a notch. If Apple made the decision to not have a notch on this model, a user would down grade to have less screen real-estate when Face ID is implemented in newer models. In addition, this is a major upgrade. Thus, regardless of a creator&#39;s stance on the notch, they are going to buy. Because it is so f**ing expensive, buyers are more likely to rationalize the notch.

Brilliant review.

The &quot;new&quot; MagSafe is neither thinner nor stronger than the original. It is the SAME.


wow marquess another 15 million subscribers then you&#39;ll have the same amount as Ellen

Very good review

Hate the design of these. Big, bulky heavy and ugly. They sacrificed portability to fit all that power in it.

He’s like “These pandemic laptops are next level “😂😂

Any Redcode RAW playback/editing issues on the M1 Pro? Export times aren&#39;t a huge deal for me, but the playback issues even with just 6k RD3 files on my current 2020 intel iMac drive me nuts.

This seems like the logical step up from the 2011 model

Socks and sandals babyyy!




and just like the others, reiterating the specs and then stating &quot;yep this is a professional tool&quot;.




Ok, nobody says nothing regarding the massive ram, ok...




Nice review ! Keep It Up ! 👍





Why would you want a Macbook?






Been waiting for this since 1998




But don’t you miss the larger screen of the iMac while on the go?





I really hope game developers start making games designed natively for these m1 chips and arm chips in general... main thing is an example: eve online. Im on a MacBook Air the base model with 8gb of ram and im running in 1440p all ultra settings maxed out with really good performance.. mind you thats without a fan and using quite small bit of power comparatively. I imagine if game developers really worked to utilize the architecture and hardware to its full potential, apple computers and the apple silicon could drive the future of gaming. sounds crazy but running eve on max settings sure its not the greatest latest in gaming graphics but its impressive nonetheless. I really hope so, because I can&#39;t stand windows for a minute. Apple OS in both mobile and Mac have just been superior in my opinion.


Fun fact:Marques introduced me to 20sly music. Calm down ,I don’t mean literally 😂😂




Man I cant wait for the silicon replacement for the 27 iMac


that notch looks so bad


You like doing apple commercials now huh?




<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m01s">1:01</a><br>Smallest OS X machine you mean?




Notchbook Pro 😂




♥️♥️♥️awesome laptop😍😍😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻


Next level price too





Always great coverage. love it!





Nothing funny on them going back to adding ports. It was perfectly planned.
great video mate, I got the 16&quot; M1 Pro for UI designing, and having loads of tabs and apps open, and it is mental fast.  I was usually waiting for things to happen or having to close down other apps because of lagging,  on the 15&quot; 2019, and this just saves so much of my time and doesn&#39;t break my flow of having to wait for the machine to catch up.  This is not just another year better, this is truly next level tech.


Im sure someone else has said it in the comments, but loving the Pixel 6 Pro &#39;Panda&#39; edit (which Im sure is dBrand)


gotta say, I can&#39;t stand the look of that notch, horrible


Seven hundred and what


You fools! They returned the ports because they saw the usb c apple adaptors don&#39;t make enough money since they are very expensive and were &quot;counterfeited&quot; by chinese companies. Now. They &quot;stick&quot; it to em


Still stuck on 768GB of ram…


The only MacBook Pro review we need


Ethernet on charger would be like 🤯🤯🤯


@MKBHD, how do those export times from Final Cut Pro compare to previous Intel MacBook Pros? Something like the previous generation 16&quot; or perhaps the 13&quot; MacBook Pro with an Intel processor. That would be a great comparison overall.



that intro music


I wish they would make the keyboards a little more customizable. You should be able to pick what backlight color you want


“This is 8k Red Raw footage in higher quality mode” <br><br>My 2014 MacBook Pro: *laughing in proxy only


Mac is going to charge an obscene amount of Money using their own processor.


I&#39;m absolutely saddened by the fact that engineering software like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, GIS programs and new drone mapping programs can&#39;t be run on MacBooks without the use of BootCamp and running Windows. The potential for increased performance and productivity by running those with MacOS is incredibly high. There&#39;s nothing I want to see more than that as a person in the engineering field.








































































Great review! Where did you get the android toy?


First off i HATE that camera placement. Looks completely out of place


My current MacBook Pro is from late 2013. I didn’t need to upgrade until now. Touch Bar? Never wanted it. Ports? Always had them. Feels like the perfect time to level up!


I&#39;m sorry.... Did you say 768 GB of RAM? What the actual fuck are you doing with that much ram? Like... I&#39;m jealous but I don&#39;t know why?


I had to see the intro twice. Superb edition skills


Awesome review. Are you going to review the Sony Xperia Pro 1?  The $1800 phone


If you are on PC keep pressing 1.


No Duh! Of course Its powerful.


But the question is: Can I watch YouTube with the MacBook Pro M1 Max?


Am I the only one who noticed MKhaByHD at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m40s">2:40</a> ?




Laptop is meh its okay therss a lot better in the market price wise and for those who are tech user really





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m03s">6:03</a> had to double back he said it was hdmi 2.0 and not 2.1





No thanks, I’m happy with my windows XP laptop.


I am happy with my M1 2020 pro that almost goes for two days straight on battery. Fan hardly turns on and hardly gets hot.. It can also run windows (need for build, etc.) VM smooth like a butter with parallel.





What I love the most about MKBHD reviews is your lack of hyperbole. So you know that when you say, “next level”… You mean it!




These intros are getting better and better every time! Maybe the notch is so big SO they don’t have to change anything in the future in MacOS Monterey.


Pretty sure there is a laptop called &quot;Dell Precision Workstation Notebook&quot; that&#39;s basically a server in a laptop case


This is a shameless advert dressed up as a feature content youtube post.  The scum found there way here 10 years ago.  There is no getting away from people trying to sell you shit!


yo what


I can already see all the people spending $2000 on the new MacBook altough they&#39;ll never need more than 10% of its power.


Rubbish apple with the notch


MKBHD with the Apple bias again.


This is completely unrelated, but, I just love how Air Jordans look better when they get a little bit worn in. MK be rocking a lot of heat on his feet.


I thought about buying but nah Im chilling with my M1 Air I love this thing


Not the notch


M1 Pro 16&quot; sounds an ideal setup for everyone even with the base setup with 10 CPU cores and 16 GPU cores with 16/32 GB RAM. I don&#39;t see a point in spending more on the GPU unless your workload could really benefit of it...


We want an Ethernet port!



Ordered one can’t wait










I wonder if you have a website. You create a lot of content, have you thought about creating a website for it? Also if you do end up doing that, would love to be on that team



Hey Marques, what do you think about upgrading from the M1 MBA to the M1 Pro MBP. Would you recommend it for a normal usage? Is the M1 Pro a lot better than the M1? I would love to see a comparison! Love your reviews, greatings from Germany 🇩🇪!




When will apple make a laptop capable of running programs like Autocad and Rendering programs like revit, etc.?



Herh! These shirtsss Marquezzzzz, damn





This magnet charging needs to come to iPhone. That’s the one problem with <br>usb-c and lightening. If you knock them while plugged in, it could cause damage.  This magnet fixes that issue.




I miss TOUCH BAR 🙁




that notch and performance!


I know there’s a lot of folks ok with the notch, and more folks who use their webcams a ton, but apple coulda skipped the notch and came up with a redesigned iSight camera and made even more chedda to gobble up.




pls help our beautifull planet with your reach and review the Fairphone 4 or any other phones/products with such concept.<br>People need to now about those products :)<br><br>Like, that he sees the comment. Thanks! :)





Just as I got the 2020 model and spent my good coin on all the extension cables you&#39;re telling me they just put them back? I also loved the old chargers and they just brought them back?? I hate apple.





Thank you for saying &quot;etcetera&quot; not &quot;eccetera&quot; as many do.





Hey MKBHD…..a quick question….has anyone tested the 16” M1max…MBP….with softwares used specifically by architects….for 3D modelling and rendering. ……specifically using Sketchup and some rendering engine…..In fact I would like a recommendation on which rendering engine would work the best on the new Macs…….thx
Ahhhh the &#39;top notch&#39; design... I see bro, I see the joke




Is the video quality the same when using the M1 hardware accelerated Prores as doing the same thing on the Mac Pro?





Congrats 15M





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m10s">17:10</a> think the graphics on screen are completely wrong


hahahah .... &quot;JESUS&quot; ....


768GB of RAM!?





Thanks, I really enjoy watching your videos and you tell it as it is. Awesome.





Intros are awesome!! Great job





Someone please tell that introduction music??😩





thanks i’ll stick with my 2014 pro that whirrs like a jet engine and burns my fingers when I put them on the vent





Another great review, just purchased the 16&quot; MBP M1 Pro with 32gb of RAM and I&#39;m blown away. Coming from a 13&quot;, the extra screen real estate is a game changer.







Looking at Cinnebench results: Omg, modern high-end mobile CPU  i7-1165G7 is more powerful that 2013&#39;s desktop king i7-4770


What do people do with a MAC you can&#39;t play on?<br><br>And why buy a expensive MAC when you can get something cheaper do the same?

Does the keyboard still leave key marks on the screen?


i&#39;m sorry... 700hoW MUSCH??
CAN I LEND SOME MONEY PLZ😂😂
As an Android/Windows user for my entire life and kind of an Apple hater, this is the first time I can say that Apple seriously impressed me. It&#39;s unreal to see how good these things are, goes to show how much of a joke Intel has become. While I have no use for such a device, I&#39;m seriously seriously impressed with what Apple did here.

it&#39;s amazing until it needs repair. that&#39;s where you get screwed by apple. Great product or not.  Do your research before you buy it.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m20s">16:20</a> mkbhd was using 768gb ram mac? I&#39;m done for today 😑


Looks really old I don’t like it one bit
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m08s">17:08</a> you accidentally wrote “M1 Pro” twice. The second one should be “M1 Max”.<br>Like this so he sees it!!
Honestly ever since Jonathon Ive left Apple has been making their devices thicker and giving us beter battery life and better features. <br><br>I&#39;m so glad he&#39;s left, Apple can finally start putting function over form again.
Amazing. A 2012 Macbook with a new Lid/Screen and a couple USB-C ports. Took the Engineers under an hour to redesign. The new $99.00 Logic board screws right into the old chassis and cuts you off from the rest of the World.

Damn I love this notch to be honest, it seems so amazing. I just wish it had the body of the air instead of this blocky body.




But why a cable based Ethernet, it is not a stationary Mac mini!
Magsafe is totally ridiculous! PD via USB-C would be good choice and great! Better take a 100W Baseus GaN PD charger for under $30, with 100W cable added. I love them!

Apple: Gives MacBook Pros fingerprint scanners/Touch ID, but gives iPhones Face ID. I swear it would have made sense to do the opposite more, phones should at least have both. Apple is just cost cutting like mad.


iStat menus is great. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=11m57s">11:57</a>


Had to pause and replay to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m27s">16:27</a> to be sure I heard you correctly... Your Mac Pro has 768 GIGABytes of RAM!? 🤯


What kind of fetish does Apple design have with the notch? lol
So now Touchbar models will be cheaper.
The squared off design just looks really old lol.
Now Apple just needs to bring back fingerprint scanner for iPhone 14 lol, Apple just taking away and putting back existing features because they can&#39;t innovate much lol.
Hows the board?
Finally an actual upgrade to the 2012 Macbook Pro! Been waiting 9 years!!












Finally ports are back. Meanwhile my work was about to give me an M1 Air, I asked for a Macbook Pro and it had to go for a special request. I don&#39;t want thermal throttling on the Air even though the M1 runs a lot cooler than Intel.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m50s">0:50</a> the things 4k got pro YTers doing these days.
I love the m1 MacBook Air, its enough for me! Waiting for the iMac Pro, or the Mac mini!





Always clear picture of all product






Definitely my favorite Macbook Pro design of the past 10 years. Just hate the notch, seems like a thing from 5 years ago when the tech wasn&#39;t really perfected.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m32s">8:32</a> <b>&quot;They are 10-bit panels&quot;</b><br><br>I am pretty sure they are 8-bit panels. Can you check this again Marques?


How bad do they heat up? Not sure if that was mentioned





Compare them to this years Intel processors, not 9th gen ones




Been waiting for this!!!!






It&#39;s Xiaomi design, don&#39;t you see?)<br>First Xiaomi tried to make some similar to Apple, now Apple...




which windows os laptop is equal to this macbook or comes close to this performance? i want to buy new laptop but not into apple eco system

This is very cool👍
Aespa is the real Next Level
I only have one question. was he using a custom model for the 16 inch? like was everything maxed out? 64 GB of RAM/ Unified Memory
APPLE + MKB = <b>NEXT LEVEL!</b> Damn, I&#39;m really wanting a 16&quot; M1 Max MacBook Pro now....

Anyone care to share thoughts on the new Mac mini M1? I have a 2012 which is struggling and am interested to find out if it’s worth the upgrade with older tech I’d still use, like FireWire.
what the scene at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m45s">2:45</a> about lmao
Best review line: Jesus!
I think I’m the only person in the entire world that would miss the “touchbar”<br><br>That’s the only reason I’m using a pro, I just fell in love with the TouchBar







Can it power dt 770pro 250 Ohm ?

Marques making my 16gb ram feel like 12mb. when he mentioned he had 768 GIGABYTES of RAM 🤣🤣

Thanks for the run down mate. really want a decent laptop

768 GB Ram?

&quot;one less dongle&quot; should be the video title.

Getting advice about macs from a mac fanboy is like asking a drug addict how to get sober. <br>It just does not make any sense.

2027 - seems about right

I don&#39;t understand why you couldn&#39;t just download a program that allows you to access your Mac from your laptop and then upload the files you want to edit and render and all that stuff to the computer that has the processing power and then remotely have that computer do the work you need to do...<br>Yeah it&#39;s an extra step however that way you don&#39;t have to go through the process of unloading your computer and setting it up...<br>You don&#39;t have to carry that heavy desk computer around.<br>I know it&#39;s nowhere near as heavy as computers can be or used to be but still decently heavy

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m10s">2:10</a> never for pros or do you mean m1s? cause i distincly remember macbook pro 16&quot; 2019 screaming all the time... glad i am not using it anymore, i was gonna go crazy from all that noise. also for the love of me i have no idea why they keep putting the prongs for the wall power on the corner of the brick, it always causes issues because it is just too big to stay like that. can&#39;t even change the orientation either. also touch bar was cool, i could force function keys to show up there so it would be usefull, now what? no dedicated function keys at all. which is a big big problem.

“Top notch design”
using the Google Pixel i see.
Reminds me of “they’re evolving, just backwards”
It’s unbelievable nobody will complain about the thickness of these laptop, they are thick as a hell! Processing capacity is amazing but they could make it using the shape of the previous one.

OMG- mag safe back !! 👏👍
So I&#39;m the only one surprised by the 768gb of RAM he has on his Mac? Ok...
They could have just kept the screen and simulate a notch in the software...
Thank You.
Why didn&#39;t they combine the mac with touchbar + dedicated keys? Looks like on top there is enough space to include the touchbar. 2 in 1. Everyone happy.

Most people would be comfortable with the M1 Air for most use cases.

Apple shouldn&#39;t provide the power brick🤣, thought they want to be environmentally friendly.<br>Users can use their previous power brick...lol
When is the VIVO X70 Pro + review coming
we can all relax now :-)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m24s">16:24</a> dude are you serious that&#39;s a ridiculous amount of RAM
Unjustifiable notch, and your giving it a pass🤔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m37s">4:37</a> why marques🥲🥲🥲
It&#39;s not called a dac bro... DAC&#39;s do the conversion... in your context you were talking about an amp.... The dac is built into the laptop already but you can have external DAC&#39;s obviously (some have amps and some don&#39;t)
Are you kidding, you have 768 Gigs of RAM? That&#39;s way more than the storage capacity of my MacBook Pro😫

Can you please not put one on top of the other? 😬Thank you!
Where should I sell my kidney 🤣
Really excited on this 🤩
Groot at 0.29.<br>Where can i buy that?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m20s">16:20</a> mkbhd was using 768gb ram mac? I&#39;m done for today 😑
So many years I have been watching your videos, and they are always amazing, honest, frank, a little different than what all try to do. Kudos for that !!!!
&quot;good in a pinch&quot; &quot;one less dongle&quot;...comes up a lot:) and I agree - high impedance good headphones support is critical for producers, editors and even hobby listeners to enjoy!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m24s">16:24</a> “ of course it have ONLY 64 gigs of RAM”
Only 768 gigs of RAM?
Creatives and probably gamers are loving it! Any IT (networking, pentensters, cybersecurity) professionals with a little review on how it works with apps like GNS3, PnetLab, EVE, Oracle Virtualbox, VMware Workstation and the likes?
hopefully Intel will die soon!
aaah so this is the &quot;One Less Dongle Pro&quot;.
Am investing in crypto now........the dip is a clear sign for new investors to come in✅✅







I am not going to watch this<br>This will make me buy
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m20s">4:20</a> &quot;If you&#39;re a one charger for everything person like me&quot; <br>If that were the case, you wouldn&#39;t be rocking anything with a lightning port 👀
bit disappointed you re not bashing it more regarding HDMI 2.0, slow card reader,  and lack of gigabit net port on the brick
Only 64 GB ram 🥺
Where did you get that Groot flower pot (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m10s">1:10</a> bottom left corner)? I must buy one for my gf :D
I just wish they’d added at least one USB-A port. It would’ve been really helpful for me. I’m happy for MagSafe and SD card reader though, I’m excited as an audio professional.

I think this is the C-R-A-P-P-I-E-S-T MacBook I have seen in the history of Apple
M1 Max is weaker than my early 2020 laptop and the M1 Max costs 3x more. Only amazing thing about this laptop is the low wattage.
So big and heavy
Bitcoin is the future, investing in it now will be the wisest thing to do especially with the current rise in bitcoin








































Pretty Impressive and I’m a PC guy.
It is what it is
Nah the touchscreen pad was a gimmick that I would have used for a quick note commands list..it was useless

768gb of ram ???
you talk too much.




would it makes sense for Apple (or any computer make) to make their laptops water resistance?
I still miss the ability to put a disk in
I am happy that the ports are back. I never understood why they were taken away in the first place. But I can’t afford the new MacBook Pro anyway. The price is far too high. One more thing: I miss the LED-lights telling how much power left in the battery. That was awesome!

20Syl and C2C !<br><br>You have some good music taste sir ! :3
Small thing, longitudinal not lateral.
768 BG OF RAM??!!
But can it run chrome?
The extra port of a welcome move, less dongle to purchase, less e-waste, saving the environment. And it doesn’t seem like a noticeable size difference with the extra ports.

Imagine copying apple designs by making laptops slimmer, removing ports, and apple just makes a u-turn. Haha..
Gift me a macbook air or pro please u really need it but not have the money

iPhone 13 pro max review plz
Been watching this video halfway and realized it was 480p the whole time.. bro it still very crisp i thought it was auto 1080p lmao
Si are you saying it is officially really worth buying a MacBook?
This is an awesome machine 😍
I ordered the 16” M1 pro 16gb with a 1tb SSD. I can’t wait to get it!
really enjoying my m1 max mbp :D
That intro was so sick!!
50 thousand dollar is price of mac pro
The review I have been waiting for
&quot;wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus&quot; XD I ripped
Dbrand skins for magsafe cable and adapter?
So they don’t have a USB port for me to stick my hard drive in or anything 😐
&quot;Uuuunnnlimited poweeeeeer!&quot;
Hey Marques I think you should do another smartphone assistant battle/comparison just to see where they&#39;ve come since you&#39;re older video on it!
Marques, Please do a video on affordable laptops for students or people on a budget in general
bought 14 mac pro and it blows my mind. super fast, quiet and of course it&#39;s not as hot as the Mac Intel CPU. This is a game changer for Apple
Top NOTCH design indeed 😂
this new design language. It’s almost as if the PowerBook G4 Titatium had a child with the 2006 MacBook Pro and had a facelift to look like the 2009 aluminium MacBook.
I&#39;m convinced Marques is employed by Apple. I cannot believe people are okay with a notch on a laptop that blocks menu information. 🤦
What’s the song
Now just give us back the backlit Apple logo !!!
The amount of money apple is putting in MKBHD&#39;s mouth and ass is too damn high...
Other Techtubers: &quot;Apple says it supports high-impedance headphones!!&quot;<br>MKBHD: <i>Actually tries plugging one</i>
Why should someone get a Mac Pro instead of one of these with an M1 MAX?
Apple is one of the most stubborn companies ever.
When this man realises that rtx and gtx laptops compute and work better. <br><br>Omg bruh why would u carry a big ass case.. you can just low key get a better laptop
We&#39;re giving you all these ports because... courage.
that opening cold ❄ ❄
Still no keypad? 👎👎
What is the color of this Mac book that are shown in the videos
Embossed, not Engraved &quot;MacBook Pro&quot;  Logo
Funny part is it may have 80 core but games run on 10 fps 😎👍🏼
hi<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>hi
you have how much RAM on your Mac Pro??? 768GB is insane, goddamn. guess it makes sense for that price tag though o.o
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m32s">12:32</a> Linus unsubscribed
the only question is, is the panel true 10 bit? or just 8bit with high RFC?
Anyone know if the Max is worth it over the Pro for music production (Ableton live)?
intro song name please??
Lol I got a iMac Pro ad before I started watching
Outstanding video thanks
1 TB?
Dude why not use cloud computing instead?? You need yourself some serious cloud!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m37s">4:37</a> wowwwwww marquess
notch is fine, but no face id still with a notch this won&#39;t be fine
MKBHD is the Goat.
This video payed for by … apple.
The notch is just such an inconvinience. Now I may be a Samsung boy but I always keep a close eye on Apple. I do have to say, the notch is kind of a step-back. There are countless videos showing that some stuff don&#39;t show up when it is in the middle of the freaking top of the screen(the notch). Now I am pretty sure this can be fixed with a software update but then again. You shouldn&#39;t have to release a whole update for something that could&#39;ve been fixed pre-production wise. Just unconvinient...

Intro = 🔥🔥🔥
the hdmi 2.0 is cuz most tvs don’t have 2.1
When you realize he has an Android &quot;doll&quot; in the background...
Till you get a problem with them then its pretty much $$$ down the drain, don&#39;t expect much from warranty or Apple care... Already heard some friends of mine having battery and screen issues and as usual Apple doesnt come up with a solution other than a fix that will cost $$$
what a great video, Ruben Tech was here 😅💪🏿
Mac Pro with 768GB of RAM 🤯
So can I get the iMac? Please.
great review. not helpful for me but still great review. i do music production and my concern (which has been validated) is that there are some important plugins (at least to me) that don&#39;t work on these new macs. this is why i&#39;m pissed they stopped making intels cold turkey. also plug in companies are not moving quickly to update their software to work on the new macos. i&#39;m still on catalina because everything works on there. i can&#39;t even move up to big sur let alone monterey. so i think music producers (unless you use logic and their stock plugins) will be staying put for a while. at least many of them. hell maybe i should switch back to a pc hahaha.

overrated device
&quot;140 watts is a lot of power&quot;  *looks at 850 watt 80+ gold power supply that retails for less than replacement MacBook power supply.   <br>Jokes aside, I can&#39;t see much use for this if you aren&#39;t making videos. The photoshop gains are incredibly minimal from the 13 inch 2020 M! which is still pretty incredible. I also kinda like the Touch Bar :(<br>I feel like people sleep on it. It&#39;s pretty great if you put like 20 minutes into setting it up.
that intro tho 🤤

The Mac Channel

Hey MKBHD why don’t apple include so many iOS, iPadOS apps in the macOS App Store

Dont hate the notch guys because it is a difference than other laptops 😍
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m18s">0:18</a> seconds I thought there was a fly messing up the shot 😭
truly next level $$$$$

Never had a mbp but why did yall want touchbar to go away? I really loved it and wanted my first mbp with it. What could possibly be wrong about touch bar? I don’t use sd cards but Ive never wanted them to go away. Lucky me Apple listened their customers for the first time and the customers were against me.




I think its time to upgrade from my 2012 MBP 😜
It looks ugly AF
I still have a late 2016 MBP and surprisingly it still holds up, but seeing these announced makes me really really want one

if it had a USB-A port it&#39;d be perfect

&quot;The MacBook Pro only has 64GB of RAM&quot; <br>&quot;The Mac Pro has 768GB RAM&quot;<br>I feel poor

He lugged around a “travel iMac” so it won’t be a big deal to pack a tube amp for the beyerdynamic dt 770’s 😂.

For 4k bucks I don&#39;t need a &quot;In a Pinch&quot; computer , I want the best at that price...

Add
Ooooooo... I think it is about time it upgrade from my Macbook Pro 15inch Mid 2014!!

I&#39;m confused. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m42s">16:42</a> What Pixel are you using? It looks like the 6 Pro. But the top bar seems too dark to by the Clearly White. It&#39;s probably because it is contrasted against your matte black shirt. It almost looked like you had a white DBrand skin on the bottom half of the Stormy Black.

glad I got this! the speakers tho.
I&#39;m just waiting for Groot to move 👀

Frigging AWESOME
“Top notch” design. Cheeky 👏
I’ve been editing on the 13” mbp m1 this year and it’s been super frustrating. My footage is 4K 10 bit and it’s lag city. Can’t wait to upgrade 🤘🤘




Apple totally optimised these laptops for media people as they get most PR from them. But as a software engineer, I am disappointed.

A new &quot;Top Notch&quot; design... was the pun intended??


Imagine a chinese clone arriving soon.

So are we getting the what do I really think about samsung  video
Is there a surface pro 8 review coming?

Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money irrespective of which party makes it to the oval office.













Looks like a Beats Fit Pro review is imminent!
The expensive price is really next level!
Almost 4K? Cmon, Apple. Get with the 20s.
look at us! we took off the hdmi!!  look at us!! we brought the hdmi back!! innovation!! oh wait :D
That was by far my favorite intro that you have ever produced. Incredible animations and transitions. Setting the bar higher every video. Nice job Marques






apple crashes on docks with displayport, read the massive threads about it, one of many issues macs have, they&#39;re a joke, company&#39;s a joke, overpriced facebook machines
This is what happens when Apple actually tries
so there is a notch but no faceid?
Ive been thinking about the question why dont apple make a black magsafe wire. Why would they want segregation in the production/sales that eventually lead to a “low selling” magsafe version. This is not a Dbrand product idea btw , just a thought to answer the question being asked. :)

What I find funny is that people are complaining about the notch but if you go into any corporate office that primarily uses pc laptops as their main machines, you&#39;ll see at least half of them with a piece of tape covering the camera or a plastic piece with some type of logo covering the camera. So what&#39;s the big deal?
Looks like Apple  is refubrishing the old Macbook parts into new Macbook
&quot;One charger for all&quot;<br>iPhones still using... nvm
This will be replacing my Mac mini for music production this summer. 🔥🔥
M1nd blown..
Perhaps the notch is big so they can future proof the design when they add a better camera, faceID et cetera.. would be lame to keep changing the size as new innovations come out.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a> Haha I see what you did there. U get it?
Marques Brownlee: Someone replied to my comment and spoofing as you.  Just a heads up.
marques will u invest in some hand lotion bruh 🥲
Next up: M1 Pro 27” iMac. I really want to see this.
Great and thorough review Marques!  Only minor thing is I think the Verge&#39;s graphs are a bit mislabled mid-way through your video.  But your content itself is top notch, accurate, and beautiful!  It&#39;d be interesting to try out my workflow needs on these machines.
Why the face you make when you say they&#39;re very good made me feel things 😳
Nothing wrong with socks and sandals man
It&#39;s not so relevant that a laptop can&#39;t fully power high-powered headphones as they can&#39;t provide the same level of high quality sound than an Hi-Fi player anyway, mainly due to the DAC component that is limited in size to fit the laptop.
Mkbhd bro tell me how good is the screen I know I can&#39;t afford it yet...talk to me bro???
Damn this laptop is really great!! Holy crap
My 1200$ asus has 144hz refresh rate
Thanks for mentioning you can have 14 inch maxed out to the same specs as the 16 inch. This can be overlooked and very useful info.
Notch on a computer... yikes.  Other than that looks great.

yuck, ugly notch
Lol ‘top-notch design’ 😂 I see what ya did there
Awesome review👍<br>Awesome laptops

Omg! I haven&#39;t had a Imac since the g5 which was amazing! I spent 2years collecting that money, this seems best time for an upgrade but looks like Ill be saving for another 2years with that price! bloody hell. We doing competitions or giveaways by any chance or have I missed it @Marques Brownlee?

Heavenly Father I pray that you keep the person reading this alive, safe, healthy, and financially blessed ❤️

It&#39;s good that a company such as Apple is finally realizing the importance of built in ports and giving the new model a thicker but superior heat dissipating chassis for the more powerful chips.  :)
That’s not the 2027 MacBook
they have f—ed up scrolling in safari on non m1 … typical apple “ooops. .. what? our software should work on our hardware on day 1??? … what a concept… “ ….. same as the notch .. “what? you expect us to test these things before releasing monterey???”

looking forward to the flossy carter collaboration
Quick notes were not enabled by default on my 2020 mac pro m1. You need to enable through System Preferences.

this is pure advertising good made

Yeah, what Apple achieved with their M-Chips is bigger as the iPhone, but only technical people really understand what they have created. Its truly amazing and kicking ass.
Thanks !

I wonder if Apple gives you all of these products or you have to return them after testing them

i said i&#39;d never buy a new iphone until they remove the notch.  still on iphone 7.  now they&#39;re adding a stupid notch to their laptop range. haha, guess it&#39;s not going away any time soon.
I love the baby groot!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m57s">3:57</a> bruh, it&#39;s apple, they will release it in a couple of months  from now, and charge an extra $199.99
Really want to upgrade my MBP 2016 (Touch Bar) 13” to one of these 🤤

When I saw a notch on the laptop I thought it was a meme!
کارت حرف نداره ❤️❤️👍👏👏👏

I always wondered how you traveled with the iMac and I’m glad you showed us 😂


I am groot 😂😂

Why the notch??
Imagine this thing gaming, it would the heaven :)
What about gaming ? 😔 lemme see gaming on it.


damn there is 50000 dollars macpro!!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m48s">16:48</a>
To me, the first M1 was the real revolution, these M1 Pro and Max just confirmed HOW CRAZY it is !
So Mac are made specially for YouTubers? I wish I could see how other programs work like photoshop, chrome, emails etc etc…
&quot; Top Notch Design &quot; - Literally :D
That intro was next level - absolutely incredible

768 gb of ram 😱

You&#39;re right, Apple is making notch as their design language but that is a dumb idea, MacBooks are already unique<br>their design is unique and there is no need for the notch, the notch is so disappointing.
I feel like I&#39;m one of few who actually really liked the touchbar



I have an m1 air with 7 GPU cores and I produce music and edit videos every now and then and it works great, so I can&#39;t even imagine how fast m1 max is with 25 more GPU cores and 2 more CPU cores 🤯

Can’t wait for mine to arriveeeee

Human Psychology: If you can save them from the troublesome process of doing the job and save them alot of hassle of work, they can ignore one or two things even if those are so annoying, they will say it&#39;s ok. please stop justifying the notch on macbooks

I love this intro sequence
MBP has been getting softer and softer with each new release. I want better GPU options and I want more than a 60hz screen.




well, great news for editors i guess.

Now we just need to find a place selling the 32GB Max versions...
Soon the 15 million subscribers ... What are you going to do to celebrate?  Give each of us MacBook Pros?  It would be nice eh !!! 🙂🙂

Excellent review. Typical... My new computer is now old.

2019: “Apple will surely kill the notch by 2021”<br><br>Apple:
Did you just say your Mac Pro has 768gb of ram?

wow very cool<br><br><br>       <br> Read More...
Watching this on my maxed out 16&quot; M1 Max. As a software engineer, so far, has been amazing. I am still setting up all the configuration for the different languages I write in but so far I have been amazed in this year&#39;s Macbook Pro performance, battery life and speakers. Definitely worth the high price imo.





bro make a video on metaverse
&quot; Engineering hours are much more expensive than laptops &quot; !!                            !!  W O W  !!
&quot;only 64gigs of ram the imac that im used to has 700&quot; bro thats more than my desktops ssd

&quot;It&#39;s one less dongle&quot;
I can&#39;t wait to see Marques with socks and sandals :D

It looks Old school and New school at the same time😂😂

Notch doesn’t matter


Im dying to see the M1 Max come to Macmini!



However, I hear Louis&#39; voice in my head and can&#39;t get onboard with these
Hella nice, although I hope they use the LATEST version of those ports next time alongside adding Face ID if they&#39;re going to make that big ass notch mandatory.

looks like we&#39;ll have a wearing socks and sandals video next year 😅

Can someone confirm that traveling that iMac traveling is not a joke, seems something very-very unbelievable!

Too Late

How did you get that pixel 6 pro color combination?

next level restriction maybe. it&#39;s a piece a shit i can&#39;t do shit with

That notch though .... on a laptop of all things.

&quot;Saving you a dongle&quot; is such a first world convenience 😂 I&#39;m all for it though

Macbook pro is not very good, but good in a pinch.

When a kid review his favorite brand.

I had the previous macbook (which replaced a macbook i had for 4 years for music production) and i literally stopped producing music because it would run the fans and heat up upon launch of any DAW and plug in<br><br>hopefully i can look into getting this monster, thanks

The future of computers is having everything Integrated on a single chip <br>Jesus Christ

“I’ve never used a MagSafe Mac full-time” is when I realized I’m ancient. 👴🏽

I like that Apple actually listened to their costumers this time. Thumbs up, Apple.
I’ve noticed a difference in the system battery percentage and the coconut battery app. The stock reading was usually around 2% higher

me watching this on a macbook 2012

Well as much as i like the idea, i think ethernet via MacSafe couldnt be a thing.

The slogan for this review is, “pretty good, one less dongle”

If it can’t run a game at 4k what’s the point in wasting 4k for this PC unless your an activist then do your woke scamming on it.

im gonna get all the mints with this laptop

THANK YOU I rediscovered tetra cuz of this video

Did he just casually say 768gb or RAM ? Or am i tripping

your intro is better than my old MacBook😂🔥
&quot;Like your beats&quot;? Who has beats nowadays?

Best review, thanks bro 👍🏻👍🏻

dang how do people edit for long hours on a mousepad , just seeing him do stuff on the laptop makes my wrist hurt

Why not make the menu bar with the notch all black. Then it will just disappear from view all the time

Usb hub on the brick would be perfection

There is a minor mistake at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m57s">16:57</a>. It was the M1 Max and not the M1 Pro that finished with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>

I’ve been using the base model 14 inch since launch. The machine is by far the best  laptop I have ever used and I have been using laptop since the mid 90s.

Having lower grade ports makes sense. You&#39;d want more, but it&#39;s like with having 60 fps, no one really complained, apart from people who either had an android phone and got used to it and tech reviewers. HDMI 2.1 hasn&#39;t been properly implemented yet, even though by the time the next one comes out, it probably will, and with the SD card reader, it&#39;s like you said, good enough. Apple have done &quot;good enough&quot; a lot for a long, long time, but Apple does pretty much assure that what they do, they&#39;ll do well, even if they could do better.

A new “top notch” design 😂 well played

Why doesn&#39;t apple just consult and pay you for advice, you&#39;d make their products so much better smh lol

Seven Hundred Gigabytes of ram? Jesus.
What do you do if you have to go outside and sandals is your only option and at that moment you are wearing socks?

These intro&#39;s keep getting better.

like everything except that nodge 😏

I love the Guy-Manuel gloves casually on the side.😏
Ahh yes &quot;works with high impedance headphones&quot; another high voltage line they can put next to a cpu pin.

I wish I had one or could afford

As much as these laptops are cool and impressive I still need a windows laptop for my engineering degree because all my programs are only in Windows which is unfortunate but these laptops are gonna be a wake up call to other laptop manufacturers and hopefully they step their game up to.

You also make your videos fit the screen without the notch! I love that

The only thing holding me back is the support of CAD for MacOS. Its a shame, I would love to use it for CAD, IF it only could support it better… vray, Rhino3D, archicad, etc.





I&#39;m just here for the intro




I m not an apple guy at all. But this shows how much intel has been screwing us over the last 5-10 years. First AMD crushes them and now apple silicon... Shame on intel. This has to change things overall. Microsoft has to take notes too. I mean the surface laptops, while i think they are great laptops, absolutely STINK in performance against this. That is not even a competition anymore.
Did this man just say 768gb ram?!




Only 64gb of ram... that&#39;s ridiculous.




$5000+ for this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m05s">3:05</a> No because I gasped when I saw the headphone jack-




No the displays are not 16/10. They are 1.54 / 1. Closer to 3/2 than to 16/10. If you turn the whole top stripe around the notch black, you ll get exactly 16/10.





Yes !!! Ethernet!!! WTF AppLe???? I appreciate your ReviEW!!! I am in no doubt hyped on this Macbook Pro, BUT I will hold off on purchasing and hang on for a bit more with my old faithful 2011 17” Macbook Pro!!! Again THanK you!!!





Yeah, its a good macbook, <b>but lets talk about the price</b>




Another great video!





Fuck Apple





I just bought Macbook pro m1 13 inch 2020 for heavy editing 4k, after effect, 3d maya, photoshop and illustrator etc. Is it a bad choice?
Apple sure has a lot of positive feedback ready to flaunt for their next event 🔥




Those ports are like Apple saying: “there’s no reason for you to go PC now!”




These are the Apple product we love to see




Thanks for helping my 🍎 stock





Does anyone know when will new mac pro come out?





Would you get this or the mac pro for 3d?
Since I am getting more into my photography, the MBP 14 inch will be my first.  Goodbye HP





Marques! HONEST REVIEW/COMMENT: The end got a bit dull. I&#39;m no pro, but ik it wasn&#39;t very mkbhd.
Great review. And, re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=5m58s">5:58</a>, definitely a downer that Apple didn&#39;t blow out the walls and bring the whole house down with really cutting-edge ports (especially HDMI 2.1 and a 10 Gigabit Ethernet (IEEE 802.3ae) port in the power brick).


Amazing review like always.

Am I the only one that hates the look and thickness of the new pro? I’m sorry it’s ugly, tacky

i got a mkbhd honey ad right before watching an mkbhd video 💀
God level tier intros 🔥🙌

Oh you try a 3d render with Maya auto desk and blender if you can
&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day, like Linus&quot; - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a>😂😂
Plz do a video on Beates fit prooo i beg u

First time I hear Jesus name in an MKBHD video. Hallelujah!
Intel iS so Fked
Why would I get this over a windows laptop?

PC master race ded now?

Wonder if these new Macs will let me use my 165hz screen at full, my current work 2020 MacBook only outputs 60hz

That intro has a better chance of making me buy the MacBook Pro over the actual commercial
“I can’t wait for the M1 Mac Pro desktop”. Marques, wtf are you going to be editing. 100k footage or something.






Can you talk without music at the background distracting or is music more important than the information

good

I swear every video one ups the previous on intro quality. This  IMO is the best yet. good job in the studio :)

Notches on screens: making people face their OCD and get the fuck over it!
PANUTAN

The lack of touch bar would be the weightiest reason for me to buy one! (CUrrently of have the 2019 with a non butterfly keyboard, but still)

pewdiepie used the intro song in one of his japan blog back in 2017/18


I am one of those people who want to charge their phone with that 140 watt brick

now just waiting on d-brand to ship the ICON skin!

Still curious how the 14” equipped with M1 Max compares

Apple loves the notch 😂 MOVE ON MAN come on

Would be very good to tell the viewers NOT TO BUY unless you are CERTAIN that your software (specially your professional or work software) will run NATIVELY on M1 chips and ARM. Otherwise, most will find out why Rosetta is the worst with its infinite bugs that WON&#39;T get fixed anytime soon. I don&#39;t wanna be that guy that will spend more than $2K only to find out all the programs they need for work are not running and, it they are, is crashing all the time.

I really like your content Marques. Your channel is one of my go to channels for everything tech.

hahahahah &quot;wear rock and sándals&quot;. LOL
I was gonna buy it until I saw the bezel😐😒 why a bezel on a MacBook phone is bad enough I can’t wait for apple to move on from that

I still don’t see the point in that ugly ass notch, it’s housing 1 fucking camera, what’s wrong with a punch hole?

&quot;But of course the macbook only has 64GB of RAM vs the mac pro I&#39;ve edited on has 768GB of RAM.&quot;


My next MacBook.

Wait what? Marques has a &quot;travel&quot; iMac? <br><b>*a few minutes of silence, immersed in self-thought...*</b>
а.... bullshit ARM in DESKTOP and NOTEBOOK all programs need to change and pay like NORMAL comuter
First of all, this shit is fire!
Did you say 50,000$ for mac book pro? .......

A thweadwipper, iS sTilL fAsTeR

How many crying slave children does it take to put together one of these.. I wonder how many of them tried to jump out of the factory and landed in the suicide Nets??? you got to figure it&#39;s at least one for every few computer. but people still buy Apple products even though they are directly linked to the slave trade.


@Marques Brownlee How stupid you have to be to carry a workstation with you when you travel? Have you ever heard about cloud services? AWS or MS Azure or even Google Cloud?

I bet they’re putting the notch in for future hardware compatibility for faceid etc

def need to switch to macbook and iphone combo
I just feel like its over priced.

The first time, I&#39;m really disappointed with your review. Many setbacks yet you maintain that they are no big deal, THEY ARE BIG DEAL!

I forgot how amazing the production of this were. For real!


Who else is waiting for that YouTube Paycheque to buy the new Mac?
Next level of shitty design?
You have to admit the Touch Bar made the computer look extra futuristic no matter if you liked it or not.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m20s">4:20</a> - I AM GROOT!
are these built with slave labour?


Not impressed/interested until they have touch screen

Love it. These M1 Macs are nutty MK. <br><br>What a time to be alive.

My guy got the drip AJ1 if you know what I mean <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m41s">0:41</a>
Do you think Apple would ever make a Mac Mini Pro now that they’ve proven these M1 chips are really that next level to make a more compact desktop rather than a tower?

Many databases, dev tools don&#39;t yet run on ARM. Why does Apple not take steps in that direction ?

On my old laptop I had the menu bar turned off so everything was full screen without having to use spaces. The notch completely ruins this for me, I’m still not over it and I still haven’t finished laughing at whoever the f made this

Great 👍 another loan to buy a new Macbook Pro.
Typo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a> ?
Yoo the way he said Jesus 🤣🤣 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m05s">18:05</a>
I feel like apple purposely put the hdmi 2.0 and slower sd slot just so they could sell you the next gen MacBook next year….major selling point: now with hdmi 2.1!

Top-notch design. I see what you did there 😄
I&#39;m so institutionalized I didn&#39;t know that even laptops came with headphone jacks these days.

Reviews like this are when MKBHD is at his best
Congratulations On 15 Million Bro.. Love You
anyone with the latest XPS considering switching to a M1 pro?





Next level intro





man ,that machine is gooood





I&#39;m wearing socks and sandals right now and feel personally attacked!




TL;DW - just buy the new Mac Book Pro M1!<br><br>Been driving my 16&quot; Pro for a week now and :BOOM: mind blown for EVERY task.  It was also a very quick jog to &quot;ignore the notch&quot; territory for me.  It just disappears in much the same manner as my iPhone&#39;s notch.
Amazing bro &quot;





Not sure what has changed but I think this is the worst video you’ve made in a long time. Maybe too judgmental or intonations. I can’t put a word on it.





Omg returning back to when the design was OP. There’s a reason buying older macs is still a thing vs the new crap.





Jack is back?<br>I never thought I&#39;d see it on such a device ever

I like the notch
Marques really pulled out a pixel 6 pro during a MacBook review
high refresh rate lol 60 hz - asus: hold my 300hz
This is thicker than my medical textbooks.
For what I plan to use this computer for, I’ll end of up having to use dongles still since my gear uses XQD cards.
seeing this from the MacBook Pro 14
The Intro, oh my G O D
Any good thing about gaming? 🙂
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a>, I thought you were throwing a pun out there saying these have a new “top notch design” being that they have the notch on top.
Hey, I would like to know can you do a video comparing the Ipad 9th gen and iPad mini. I&#39;m conflicted on which one to get for school...
i celebrate the return of 3.5 mm audio and sd card. thank you Apple. and magsafe too.
So when you were doing the test was high power mode  or automatic on in the  energy settings

I guess Moore&#39;s law is still in tact.

You’ve summoned Linus
Which of the two you will choose to work with?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a> whats the error :’p<br>Great video tho thx!
These examples by the Mac only will make Intel, Samsung and Google better. I&#39;m gonna forgoe the Intel i7 12xxx and wait for i7 13xxx or i7 14xxx which should deploy machine learning by then. &quot;The fear of loosing, gently pushes you to the finish line&quot;

“Only 64gb of ram”<br><br>My pc with 4gb of ram: 🚽
Ho ho ho (ant man sounds) I love this shot!!!
Man the boomers really got away with this one 🧍🏻
He keeps getting more and more charismatic
Gotta edit your graphic @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m07s">17:07</a>. You put M1 Pro up again instead of M1 Max for the best Final Cut Pro export.

MKBHD trallier looks cooler than official one




Your working environment is incredible. Hire me
Well apple dealt with the notch pretty well but yeah, it needs to go
I got the 2020 m1 mac for my work. First mac ive ever used, iam more a linux windows fan. But i have to admit i do understand why people use it, built quality is extremly good.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m18s">20:18</a> NOICE

THAT OPENING WAS SUPER EXTRA DOPE AND SMOOTH🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤

hhaha the error at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a> he called the m1 max 16&quot; a M1 pro xD

Love it 💓😊😊






I can not believe they introduced the notch on MacBooks like it’s not big deal. Absolutely disgusting 🤮




I stg i typed &quot;silly sound effects&quot; and got this in the top 3 recommended

These intros just keep getting better and better

Wait wait wait… 768GB of ram in the imac? Insane!

768 gigs of RAM on his mac pro, What!!

Maybe it’s necessary for the notch to be there so people get used to it. That way when the upgraded camera and sensor hardware is installed people won’t start crying because suddenly the notch has appeared with the new hardware installed.

Thanks for the detailed review MKB, it’s really mind blowing what Apple has done with their new silicon, just amazing.

Amazing
Dude.<br>I would be livid if I spent $50,000 on a mac pro.

Definitely should have mentioned regular users waiting for the next MacBook Air

Can it run smooth  autocad, inventor, solidwork without lag?

Why can&#39;t you just build a server at office and use it anywhere .... You go... I mean I have an access to 64 cores VM(college) that can be accessed by windows tab.

Very good my friend

😍😍😍🥺

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m09s">17:09</a> the 3d line must be M1 Max MBP?

Did I miss it, but how much are they?

I bought last years and it’s amazing. I’m wowed by it on a daily basis. It’s fantastic.


Money based videos

At end of day like you said, it&#39;s just a tool, no one said your tool is fancy and polished and expensive, so your picture must come out awesome automatically, it really may be justifiable of it&#39;s cost yet may be M2 pro max will be
You should make videos of your favourite gadgets.





How does an all day battery work if I can only work for 4 hours, seems like a half day battery.





As cool as the power brick with Ethernet is, the engineering on the iMac MagSafe adds the data connectivity.  It is possible the 2021 M1 Pro/Max MBPs do not have the connectivity at the laptop MagSafe connector.  Using a Thunderbolt  Ethernet adapter is fine. It&#39;s smaller and its not like you will be wanting for battery on these Apple Silicon Macs.





Does the iMac Ethernet Power Supply work on a M1 Macbook Pro? Like for a network connection, and charging?





Goodbye kidney

Looking a this video makes me so happy that i bought some Apple stocks haha
Great laptop but as an architect its not a great buy





insta buy if they didn&#39;t remove boot camp support on the m1 macs :(





MBKHD you are a true and the best Apple Sales man. Whatever design apple makes, it is the best for MBKHD and immediately jumps in to justify. Not a true reviewer in my opinion






I too will be able to retire may travel iMac.  Can&#39;t wait til my M1 Max MBP ships next week!





Doesn&#39;t these render videos quicker than high end Alienware laptops?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m53s">6:53</a> yes we definetly want to use ethernet without a dongle!
I’ve seen people at coffee shops with entire desktops on a little table.. now I understand why and know I probably won’t be seeing that as much. ☝🏼
I love watching your videos. You explain so well its funny how I find it relaxing. Even if I don&#39;t have interest with the other techy things you review I still watch them haha. hugs&amp;kisses





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=14m26s">14:26</a> what is the name of that camera in the back?
So where’s the Ethernet?





The notch is better than having a big bezel.
&quot;that part of the screen that you didn&#39;t have before&quot; That&#39;s so misguided. That would be true if you&#39;re talking about the 14-in model. If you&#39;re a grown-up and you use 16-in model you just lost some screen because your full screen apps won&#39;t use that part of the screen the way they did on a real 16-inch laptop. You&#39;re 16-in laptop is now 15.5... The notch is an abomination, there&#39;s no sugarcoating it. It ruins people&#39;s lives on the iPhone, and now it&#39;s ruining people&#39;s lives on MacBooks. All because you wouldn&#39;t stop complaining about selfie cam resolution. The blood is on your hands.
is he using proxy media while editing, or is he talking about performance WITHOUT? if that&#39;s the case, that is mind blowing...
So, Apple finally did some innovation




So how does this translate to windows boot camp playing AAA games. Specifically anything assasins creed or whatever just test all the hot battle Royales out now

is the M1 Air still good? <br>Just as a travel laptop to edit couple photos or the occasional short video

Almost convinced me until I realized the actual completion is Alder lake and ryzen 6000 series




Hows thermal throttling? Had a problem with overheating with the previous one...
Really Good Review on these. I’ve been finding myself needing the ports and ease of use to much lately.
I wonder if you used the power brick from an iMac with the Ethernet port feature, if that would work with the MBP.
We have been using dongles for years. Suddenly that should go to trash. <br>Next they will release a new one with dongles again...
What if they do what they did with the base model iPad with MacBooks 2022…<br><br>14” polycarbonate body (Black, White, Faux Silver)<br>1080p, 60hz- OLED<br>2020 M1 base Chipset with 256gb Storage.<br>*Includes 6 Months Free of Apple One Plan with Cloud Storage<br><br>Priced at $649<br>(No upgrades available at all from Apple)<br>It’s the ultimate entry level Mac.
I rewatched that intro 5 times, WTH MKBHD Team. 🤯
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m23s">16:23</a> &quot;Only 64GB of RAM&quot; Is he even Human!
I’ve been eagerly awaiting the MKBHD review. Another truly next level video! Nice job.
Cant afford......watching for fun
@mkbhd would you consider donating your old intel based 16 inch Mac book pro.   Like in a raffle or something?<br><br>Thank you.
Kinda looks like a Gameboy SP!
Review this again after 6 months to see if there is flex-gate
Hours in a Day Marquees enjoys his hotels: 0<br>Hours in a Day Marquees makes his videos: 36
i still find that notch quite... i mean it just feels weird to have a notch in a laptop.




Meanwhile, in Windows 11 universe.....
Socks and Sandals like Linus!!!!
That intro tho!🔥
Title track name?
Now can be the best time to buy and hold Bitcoin because surly it will come up to a standard rate
glad im not getting a macbook, i cant use a laptop without USB 1-3
Nice brother nice lap top 👍💰💰💰💰
Intro is just awesome
Just saying you put M1 Pro MBP instead of M1 Max MBP, just to let you know. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a>

Dude, you totally nailed it, isn&#39;t it on the power brick how in the world did they miss that. For all the stupid junk they put on this thing they didn&#39;t do that one thing that would have helped.

Bro,  can you do a review on remote desk top?   Hahahahaha 😂😂😂
I’m kinda done with Apple playing god

Well, I think the main reason for apple to bring back the ports and the increased price: performance ratio is because of the M1 chip , since not using the intel chips saves them a ton of money , and so they can actually fulfill atleast some of the demands of the customers.

Next level imac ✔️

Okay who else saw that Panda 🐼
I don’t like the notch. That’s it.

Me using macbook pro 2012 and watching this video :)))

Fine. The headphone jack being high impedance compatible is a legitimate thing. But I feel like you sold your soul for basically that and an SD card slot (your notch-soul).

previous level [ 10 yrs back level ] -  hdmi  2.0 , sd cardslot uhs2  , 1080p camera ,  ethernet port ,backlit keyboard

Maybe Apple made these new MacBooks stupid so that people with taste who have Intel MacBook pro 16s will feel like they still have the right computer. Yeah.. they&#39;re stupid with stupid notches and stupid useless connectors and stupid boxy shapes because Apple was trying to make them look as stupid as possible. I don&#39;t see any other rational explanation.





Backwards

Legacy ports and a boxy shape... Sounds like &quot;previous level&quot; to me.
play pubg in it
Couldn’t you now just start lugging a Pro Display XDR around with the laptop?

I LOL&#39;d at 768 gigs of ram. Clearly there&#39;s levels to this game 🤔🤔
is the intro track custom made for mkbhd? it&#39;s not in the spotify playlist in the description and i&#39;ve listened to every song that the credited artstist has on spotify and it isnt there



But can it crysis?
An apple fan boy is amazed that his new laptop has ports and holes into which peripherals can be inserted without dongles. <br>👏🙄

Dope dope dope dope 🔥🔥🔥🤯🔥🤯🔥🔥🔥🤯🤯🤯🤯
Jony Ive leaving Apple has been a god send, they are moving more towards functionality over form, love it.
Ok… but can it run the sims

gotta respect the editing
Marques, this is getting ridiculous. You need to go to a BLACK barber---weekly. Your hair looks a mess, and that makes no kinda sense, especially based on your income. <br>Now that I&#39;m done being petty (only slightly...), great video as usual. ;) (Go find yourself a Black barber; date whomever you like, but your hair will always belong to the Black community, bruh.)

Goodbye Jony Ive hello useful products

That intro was incredible! How do you always manage to do that?
I was considering replacing my 2019 16 inch MBP with an M1 iMac but now I&#39;m considering getting the new 16 inch M1 Max. At the same time, I&#39;m getting excited over a possible M1 Max iMac. Damn you Apple for getting me excited again for your products!

i miss lighting apple on cover
I don&#39;t get it. You talk about high impedance headphones and the DAC. What has the DAC to do with the power amplifier and the capability of driving high impedance headphones?

Sweet! I am still blown away by the 13” M1! I am selling my Mac Pro to get one of these as the make so much more sense for me. Your voice is always so calming on your reviews!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> “these laptops have top notch design” i see what you did there





Anyone else watchingn these review videos and feel completely taken advantage of by Intel for the last number of years by their power hungry, fat architecture - egg cookers?  These M series chips are crushing Intel so bad (along with AMD&#39;s Ryzen) why would anyone buy Intel?

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=22m04s">22:04</a> do you mean that you will not be using the Mac Pro at all for all your video editing? Or just when travelling?

imagine spending $50,000 and a $3k laptop is faster at exporting
With that beeping said, Apple should be on schedule to update the iMac &amp; Mac Pro!
Where can i get the baby groot?


I took delivery of my 14&quot; MacBook Pro this week, replacing my 2015 i7 13&quot; MacBook Pro and I have to say, loving it so far.<br><br>More importantly, I noticed Groot on the window sill, really interested in what he thinks. 😂 I am Groot...........?
<b>Too much power for a web developer!</b>
Can you use  it to develop 3D graphics games, will it blow up?
That notch is hideous .

Dude.... there are so many YouTube videos that are testing out gaming on the M1... they are testing GTA5  (from 2013) and sounding so amazing how well it&#39;s running.<br>These machines are fucking greatttttttttttt!!!!!!!
iShidded

Does he have a video tour or list of his gear?
Say what??? It&#39;s not the same mag safe???

the performance difference between these and the Mac Pro 28-core just shows you how inefficient Intel&#39;s CPU cores are.
Apples love to sell 59$ cords continue..
Notch everything.<br>Please stop it, get some help!
Maybe the notch width fits the width of the cutout in the laptop body (to open it with one finger). Maybe it is to avoid fingerprints that would else come left and right of a narrower notch, or to avoid scratching the display there after 1,000 times opening it and your finger rubs the display surface slightly…? Or they planed faceID and pulled it off in the last moment. Or they plan to implement it next year and already have the right notch size… speculations…
At first I thought this was an Apple commercial. 😂
All I want to know is... Are they durable or do they screens and etc break on their own like the previous ones? And... Can you repair them or change parts or are they bricked as soon as a part fails, and even the battery is superglued into the motherboard?<br>You just can&#39;t trust any reviewer, they are all payed or have to sign agreements to keep critizism to a minimum.<br>The previous generation only had positive reviews when they came out, and then you went to reddit and there&#39;s loads of posts about durability issues and so on.
Lol “top notch design”
watching this for the 10th time.
When you&#39;re at uni campus and can&#39;t find any empty study booth (because it&#39;s &quot;exam week&quot; in 2 days time).. once you get this badboy device out of your laptop bag.... The study booths become AVAILABLE! <br><br>Walking around university holding this badboy by your side... Feels like: &quot; please, there&#39;s join the queue if you wanna sit next to me&quot; 😙😋

How not being the first ro post the review is actually nice, because now you can incoeporate other peoples findings. I found it very refreshing :)

It baffles me that a company that values design so much to the point of making the internal components look good is ok with a notch this big and noticeable on their devices. But despite that, yeah, the overall product and its performance are unbelievably great.

can&#39;t waiiiiiiit to get mine.<br>I ordered mine 1 day after sales and I have to wait 1.5 weeks more than others haha. (in Australia)

did you do the graphics on that initial animation marq? seemed a little off compared to usual

the irony showing a mac review with an android bot at the background 😁😁

They crippled the ports so they could have something to upgrade in another 2 years. I hated the touchbar. Absolute fail. They should have added 10gig Ethernet To the power brick not just 1gbps.

Like 1 lakh dislike 1.4k really good bro

The Mac designer has forgotten that this is laptop not iPhone .I think so he has drink and then design laptop but then he&#39;s has confessed between them

they pump out macbooks faster than fifa games

Father of mac or iphones only huawei matebook x pro.. IPhone just making fool people

man why didnt they make the notch the exact same height as the menu bar? or make the menu bar a couple of pixels smaller? this looks bad

what an intro!!

Boss @marquees you use Next level alot on phone reviews

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=21m52s">21:52</a> that&#39;s the most disapproving nod in any review to buy a product.

One less dongle🤣

I’ll literally just bought my 2020 macbook for school like 4 months ago..

768GB of RAM, what!?

I don’t have the 💴 doesn’t me I can’t watch big

That intro 👌🏻

You all cant reach the high levels. Buy MSI and live 😉

Excellent simple review of a breaktrough device.

You would think they would be able to hide the nasty notches behind the screen now. It looks ugly

I&#39;m curious about how it detects how much power the headphones need when at best it can detect whether you have a 62ohm AKG or 3000hm Sennheiser, but how does it know that those are also 93dB/1mW and 97dB/1mW respectively?

Amazing piece of tool, however ; that Intro.... Jesus!!! Marques, you are completely on a different level.

And we start living with notch on laptop too….

it should come with an spacegrey magsafe adapter&quot; <br>apple marketing team : our new feature for 2022

so its built for video or just media content creators, this isn&#39;t a consumer laptop at all, completely wasted on your average consumer

<b>M1 max ONLY has 64 gigs of ram</b> wow 😂😂


As if the notch on the phone weren&#39;t enough, now they&#39;ve put one on the laptop. Steve Jobs would have a fit!

super neat and informative video- thanks marques

The footpads and name etched into the bottom don&#39;t look like apple at all. Looks like a cheap imitation apple product.

And this laptop is $4000?<br>No thanks.



&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals all day, like Linus&quot; 😂
Thank you very much!!! This review rocks, hats off!

Deva vu
Can you review the base model

Unapologetically apologetic, huh, Marques? :-/


This laptop has MKBHD saying Jesus it must be serious 😅

Instant like for Calling Crows ;) !

are the fans on 16&quot; better than 14&quot; - what&#39;s the cooling difference between the two?

The intro was a next level of fire! WOW!

I am not an apple fan whatsoever. However, this really seems like apple going back to form, from rich people asseoirs to creative professional tools. I like it a lot

Anyone noticed veritasium video pops up on mkbhd’s laptop @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m53s">7:53</a>
I get it these machines are incredibly good for photo and video editing. But NO ONE is testing it in other applications  like CFD simulations and large assemblies of 3D models which also requires lot of computational power. Videos editing is not the only thing people do. Please try to test it for other applications too. I hope this comment reaches you

I can&#39;t imagine how powerful the M2 chip will be considering a M1 Max with 64gb of ram can beat an Intel Mac Pro with 768gb of ram. Some day we will have a terabyte of ram in a macbook and considering how fast apple is evolving with their own chips we might see that before 2030<br><br><b>Beware: there&#39;s some scam bots in the reply section. Just ignore them</b>

Do you know who else had a notch ? Hitler. I will just leave this here 😂
Tbh at this point these laptops are only for people like MKBHD, that make videos of high quality. And theres literally only a handful of them in the world. So very niche market.

Hahahaha... good luck with a niche platform.
768GB of RAM??? O.O

Pretty great review...but more importend...whats the &quot;New York Subway&quot; Display in the backround?<br>That looks pretty awesome

But big money to pay for this 😳

Is this video sponsored by Apple??
Yep next level price too

&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day, like Linus.&quot; 😂




Not even a Macbook user but man Apple nailed it big this time<br>Impressive stuffs
Won&#39;t be long before Brainchip&#39;s Akida comes into these products. Neuromorphic chip with one shot learning and great power saving is the way to go forward.

So this is the old mac with new chip, next iteration will be new mac with new chip &quot;M1 Max Pro&quot;

You are literally comparing a 3 year old SOC with a new SOC. Basically this is a False review anyway



Intro is super

Such a great video I’ve never been more excited for the next Mac Pro and also the future of macs

Not having the ethernet port on the charging brick is a huge oversight.

@Marques Brownlee - Please upgrade your video camera as 360p or 480p vidoes on mobile aren&#39;t that clear (unbox therapy vidoes at 360p offers better quality &amp; outstanding clarity at 720p ).. will help people with limited mobile data limit...
call me when i can play serious games on it.

Calling Crows is such a good song!! !1000%🔥

A bit like some carrying a massive cassette player on their shoulder🤣

Now that MacBook doesn&#39;t like a MacBook (thin, no ports, poor performance to cost ratio, etc), I&#39;m interested! One day I&#39;ll buy a laptop that I could use while travelling.  One of the reasons I don&#39;t travel as much as I would like to is because I can&#39;t really edit videos while away. This is definitely one of the contestant.
im watching this video with the new laptop rn
while working with the laptops stationary, should you plug in the charger constantly or not?
🔥🔥🔥

Not worth 5000 dollars. No high end ports
love u man


&quot;in a pinch&quot; bleh! why? They could have rounded things up for just &quot;a pinch&quot;. <br>This is NOT a budget item where corner cutting is to be expected.
Where did you get the Groot in a pot?

We all want the Sock and Sandal MKBHD!!

would prefer snap on camera than notch and if its not oled who cares
if they added all the Ethernet the HDMI or the faster SD card reader, how would they get you to buy a new model next year?
Ugly notch.

I really think the new  MacBooks are incredible. I still miss the lighting up of the apple logo from like 5 years ago though









&quot;... and I won&#39;t even pretend to game on a Mac&quot; ... next YT recommendation: Linus &quot;Of course, I gamed on M1 Max&quot; :))


&quot;Next level&quot; 😂😂😂

Hmmm The Notch is mind blowing .. Thats why I wont  melt 3000 eur  for it ..

that damn into was so fire lol
Damn, it&#39;s ugly. Astonishing performance but this year design is meh...
Wasn’t the last MBP to have ports the 2015 ?
all that talk years ago about &#39;courage&#39; but they are clearly still not courageous enough to remove the headphone jack from their laptops
I like how he’s saying one less dongo I’m literally every point
Not that much change, just a new product eager to be sold.
The notch kills it for me and especially I don&#39;t use webcam as much. I hope next gen will eliminate or make it smaller.
Macbook Air M1<br>Macbook Pro M1<br>Macbook Pro M1 Pro 😕<br>Macbook Pro M1 Max 😧
This is the review I was waiting for. Thank you MKBHD 🙏🏾


Wasn’t aware marques is a homosexual - seems many individuals are going gay. We’ve already seen he’s a Obama supporter. So I guess it makes sense..
That&#39;s some sick intro
That intro though 😳


me waiting Marques to criticize Apple ...................................................... waiting..........Judgment day ...........waiting
WHAT IS THAT ROCKET THING ON YOUR DESK THO???
Did I just hear Marques say Jesus 🤣🤣

Top Notch laptop 🥺

Boy, they really killed it this time! Kudos to Apple. And for those complaining about the price, it&#39;s probably not meant for you anyway

Marques, a stupid account is cloning your identity to mislead people in the comments. Block them please!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=13m32s">13:32</a> &#39;these are tools&#39;<br><br>no they&#39;re not, they&#39;re fashion accessories for people with more money than sense who use em to take up a table at starbucks for 4 hours to try and alleviate some of their insecurities

Damn, That Power 🔥amazing time we live in, Next Level.
Even as an android and windows user, the new m1 chips leaps ahead of any computer chips I&#39;ve come across. It&#39;s insanely expensive but where else can one get these power, form factor, display, battery life and optimization. These laptop is just brilliant.
Nice Apple commercial. Good job

Windows behind the blinder , what does that means ?
mkbhd i know this unrelated but i am a computer programmer at age 13 and I use a dell latitude d630 which is from 2006, the specs <br>are 4gb of ram and 1.8ghz no turbo boost.please I would love if you give me one of your spear laptops even if it a 300dollars or 200<br>dollars computer I would really love it.I Have  a Youtube Chanel Tech Upfront I make coding tutorials but I stopped because of my <br>computer.Finally peace ✌️.

Well since you are using M1 Chip, you have to use apps via Rosetta which cuts your performance by15-20%? Right?<br>This concerns me, and I am hesitating to switch to M1 chip.

MacBook Air or MacMini should be enough for coding.
I think this is great, but Apple has to put back the touchbar, just on top of that row of function keys. That way it&#39;s best of both worlds. They introduced that thing and it works ok for a lot of other things, but not to replace fn keys. So yeah both will do ok.
Great video man is that baby groot behind you? 🤣
This new MacBook is insane 🔥🔥🔥
That C2C album is so good.

hmm , i wonder........ ur a millionaire why dont u get an editor?

I could be wrong on this, but from what I read HDMI 2.0 has a maximum draw of 1 Watt, while HDMI 2.1 has a draw of 2 Watt (or more). Thunderbolt 4 has a maximum draw of 100 W and since the laptop supports 3 6K displays, that is spread across the 100 W use of TB4 as 33, 33 and 33. While the remaining 1 Watt has been reserved for HDMI, totally 100 W usage for displays. HDMI 2.1 would put it over that threshold.
This is ONLY for PRO DESIGNERS. Others buy M1 air /pro.
Wait for 🙄 mrwhosetheboss comment!
I realised something that makes the notch quite beneficial: whenever I open my laptop, I tend to touch the top of the display a bit. On my old MBP from 2015 I smeared a bit of fat onto the top but it never bothered me as there was just the black bezel.<br><br>Now if there wasn&#39;t a notch, I&#39;d probably touch the actual screen area when opening my MBP. With the 14&quot; MBP (2021) I mostly touch the notch when opening the display. No idea if it is just me or if this was Apple&#39;s intention but I really came to appreciate that.

Did anyone try running any ML models? Any conclusions on that?

Can we install cracked softwares in this?

No touch bar, a month down the road they&#39;ll hustle you into buying them 😄

The thing is that most people (and businesses) buying this would do fine with a basic i5 machine. Those are more than adequately powerful to Office and cloud software which is what most people use.<br><br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it is cool that the silicon has seen some major advancements in recent years (Ryzen, M1) but when I as somewhat techy user can get everything done with a 10 year old  2nd gen i7 pc laptop (let alone my 8th gen i7u work laptop), I just cannot help to wonder why someone uses over 1000 usd to a non-gaming laptop, except for a handful of people who really benefit for having very powerful silicon.

My friend is blown away. The best machine money can buy definitely.

You remain the finest reviewer

Loved the intro......👍

50k??????

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m52s">0:52</a> why would yo do that? old iMacs have laptop class hardware, a much more powerful SFF PC would fit in your backpack

those feet are ugly as all get out. I mean I could have put my own sticky feet from walmart craft section.

Soldered SSD 🤦

Big fan bro
Indian



trash

How good are the pro max with all that GPU and low thermal for bitcoin mining?

Hiya can u do a review on Alcatel 3X please

Linus just gamed on his M1 max LMFAO.

After having a MacBook Air since 2017 - I love my Touch Bar the 13 in MBP I got a few months back

Funny thing about that notch is no Face ID

Wait, what. Your Mac Pro has 700GB of RAM???

Apple be like ....&quot; Ok ... We&#39;ve made a laptop which is close to perfect ... Now what can we do to screw it up ... Oh I know ... Lets add a notch on the top &quot; 😒

Hi ! I’m an architect and I’m I’ve been using the earlier generations of MacBook since quite sometime now. The only problem or a setback is that when it comes to rendering views on softwares like Vray or Lumion (via parallels) . Does this new generation MacBook overcome that issue with the introduction of a new powerful chip ? Can this machine finally be a good laptop for architects ? There are very less people who cover this topic and it’ll be very helpful if you share your thoughts regarding this question !


Can it run Solidworks?

HOLYSHEESSH THE REVIEW WE ARE WAITING FOR!!!!! Yaaaaazzzzz

Great video as always. Just one comment. You’ve been using blasphemy quite a lot in you videos lately. Now personally I’m not super offended by it, but I don’t like it. However, I am sure there are people out there that would be offended enough to stop watching your videos. I don’t think there are people that would be offended if you stop using it. But who knows 🤷‍♂️. As always, thanks for the great content.

Convenient in a penny pinching company.

Can i have a macbook

I came here hoping that this was a joke. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t. Disgusting

Is it good for deep learning?

This is a great review very impressed by your presentation very understandable and explained perfectly thanks for all the super info! Super presentation!

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m08s">6:08</a> that part

your shooting locations are always so unique. thanks for keeping things fresh

Yeah anything apple does is pardonable apple never makes mistakes.. <br>If another company were to implement a notch on their laptops it would have been a different story entirely....

&quot;If you had to ask...it probably doesn&#39;t apply to you &quot;😊😊😭😭😭😭

waiting MKBHD compare it to the latest i9 12900K

That intro is damn satisfying.. mkbhd big fan.

what if we charge an iphone using this adapter which has C to lightning cable?

I thought he said 140$$ power adapter…never know with apple 😂

I think marquess is will actually keep it after for video editing

Can’t you just use an eGPU with your intel MBP instead of the Travel iMac?

Who else got a MacBook Ad.

I’m still using my Early 2013 MacBook Pro 15” Retina Display I got after graduating high school that year. Even though it’s considered “vintage” and I’m no longer able to download the new MacOS updates it’s still running strong. It’s ironic that the new 2021 model basically reverted back to that year’s design and near identical ports. IMO that’s the best MacBook they’ve ever made.

I use ur videos to benchmark my displays

God! I missed those punchy intro tracks. @mkbhd please bring them back.

The touchbar case is very similar to the 3D Touch case. It didn’t take off as Apple expected and now whoever took the time to embrace it and make it a part of their day and workflow has now been left hanging out to dry. I see why they did it but as a hardcore 3D Touch user I feel sad for the now orphan touchbar fans

Thicker laptop with notch? Nonsense

Great review, thank you! I have to say the notch gets unnoticed until someone mentions it. It&#39;s just part of the menu bar to me. I&#39;ve had my 16&quot; M1 Pro for a week now and still haven&#39;t heard the fan come on. This is a beast.

Watching on my M1 Air

The Notch is not a good design. Great machine otherwise.

THAT INTRO THO...

Who else wants to buy the iPhone 13 pro and the m1😍



It&#39;s Rubbish


Damn I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s next level - your production values. This is total eye/ear candy. Oh, nice laptops too


$50k desktop slower than a laptop


The human brain makes no sense to me, these come out with notches and everyone takes the &quot;its extra screen space&quot; approach, but 6 years ago when phones were switching to notches from the giant chin and forehead bezels they once had, no one said &quot;oh its extra screen space&quot; just &quot;gross the notch is so ugly&quot;


Heads up, MATLAB does not run well on the new M1 chips. Hopefully an update will increase performance.


Since MacBooks are getting Thicc, I wish they&#39;d bring back the glowing Apple logo on the back..

Open the camera app, put the cursor on top of the camera, nice design...

Guys anyone <br>what&#39;s the intro track name??




Marques - when exporting on the M1 Max, was your footage stored internally or externally?



Hey, marcus wheres the galaxy book series review :(


Okay Im starting to think that he has a separate team for intros


Shame the os is 15 years old and walled within a drm nightmare.


Impressive


Here for the intro music


Does anybody else here not give a shit about apple products ( or the other way around,  love apple and not android)but his videos are so entertaining that you want to watch it anyway. Props man. That takes skill keep it up buddy!


AFAIK there isn&#39;t a single UHS-III SD card  on the market


Imac in a. Bag😂


I don&#39;t think I have seen you being so full of praises for one product. Haha<br>This must be REALLY REALLY GOOD.


&quot;If the next version of this laptop still has a notch this big and doesn&#39;t add face ID, I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus&quot;<br> - MKBHD Nov 2021









This is definitely a must have laptop


I have 16 gigs of ram


So...a laptop that&#39;s useful for like 1% of users? Woohoo




Braided cable is the most important upgrade


that notch is just disgusting ewww


How did you do the intro edit on the back of the laptop screen.



Until 3 years from now when all the software is no longer updating making it useless and you have to throw a masterpiece in the trash


Intel is DEAD.


768 gigs of Ram Damn.


Why these macbook doesn&#39;t comes with a num pad???


👍👍👍


i just can&#39;t imagine how powerful the next macbook pro will be.


Used a Pixel phone in a MacBook Pro review, nicely done :)


Marketing gimmick and overly priced unnecessary products..apple plays with positioning advertising and fools people to buy high priced crap

Here we go! The one I&#39;ve been waiting.. For me, nothing else matters.

I&#39;ve kind of grown fond of the Touch Bar despite its shortcomings... I wish they would&#39;ve offered it as an option


No Type-A USB ports. Huge turn-off for many.


if that wasnt the most lit intro ever imma change my name.


You seem to go out of your way to say &#39;Jesus&#39; in many of your videos? Why?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m31s">12:31</a> I&#39;ll be waiting for that socks and sandals Lmao 🤣


is this a new launched macbook or old?


But can it run crysis


Freaking 4 ads in between ;(


I love how apple is comparing their products with their products

I&#39;m gonna buy this one

I can’t even afford this machine but I’m still watching this review because its… MKBHD


How do your shooters decide what compression of red raw to use? Do some of them have underpowered machines? If the new mbp can do medium, why have low?<br>Just curious?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m32s">12:32</a> &quot;I&#39;ll where socks and sandals for a day, like Linus&quot;<br>-Marques
So basically, at this point, you can’t even confirm firsthand that these laptops even have a fan because their chips are so powerful.

But, I am not sure why the space gray laptop  doesn&#39;t come with space gray magsafe connector? 🤔🤨💁‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷<br><br>🧏‍♂️🧏‍♀️🧏Answer: Steve Jobs died, along went with the attention to details. 😥 😔 🙁

When apple first removed mag safe and went to usb c only they knew they would bring them back and that would buy them a year of doing nothing lol😂



Marques – I have basically been waiting for your (trusted) review before making my decision. Thank you :D
You use a pixel?

If the notch annoys you so much that you need to get a custom blacked out menu bar... you&#39;re a child. This laptop is a tool and the notch doesn&#39;t interfere with anything. It&#39;s just in the menu bar, the actual display part where you watch media, use programs and surf the web is under the menu bar, so you&#39;re not really losing any real estate.

Why do they have to make a wonderful laptop and put a freaking notch on top? It&#39;s a major turn off. And why is the Apple and some people acting like it is not a big deal? There&#39;s a bathtub shaped piece of plastic on your beautiful screen, why!?!?

Wait... hold up, did you just casually say 768GB of RAM? 😂😂😂

M1 Mac is truly amazing.  Great video!

The notch is what continue making Apple lame since Job&#39;s death. There will never ever be a real good product created by them in this ERA...

lol apple boasts thin bezels with the notch <br>apps: here are your thick bezels

786GB of ram? That&#39;s insane.

768 gb of ram...........

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m46s">4:46</a> <br><br>&quot;they&#39;re known as high end penis headphones&quot;

1 thing is stoopied tho:<br>No face id

I rewound a couple of times to confirm that Marques said &quot;768Gigs of RAM&quot; @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a>

Why carry a laptop (Macbook) bag when you can do all stuff on iphone xyz, MKBHD in future😅😂

What happened to MacBook Air?

I&#39;m on a 2017 15&quot; MacBook Pro with the Radeon Pro 560. A few days ago I ordered the 16&quot; M1 Max. I&#39;m so excited. My current laptop cant even quickly preview photos in Lightroom Classic without get really loud, hot, and slowing down. Honestly the 16&quot; MBP might replace my 10th gen i9 PC for some tasks in the future.

Checked daily for your video! So glad you dropped it FINALLY. Enjoyed your interview the other day talking about everything going on. <br><br>I think this is the start of the old Apple. LOVE this new design language. <br><br>It’s almost as if the PowerBook G4 Titatium had a child with the 2006 MacBook Pro and had a facelift to look like the 2009 aluminium MacBook.
Hmm interesting..<br><br>While watching on Macbook Pro 2011

Happy Diwali @Marques Brownlee... another amazing video ❤

Are we not going to talk about the Groot pot you have in the background?  I want that hahaha

I got mine last week. I also didn&#39;t like the supersized notch on my new 16 inches MacBook Pro. It seriously ruins the entire user interface experience.

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m09s">17:09</a> bottom text should say M1 Max, not M1 Pro. I found an error do I get a cookie? 🍪

Amp not Dac.

I‘m happy to announce that I’m watching this from my late 2013 15“ MacBook Pro with retina display 😃




finally man!

It looks like a Windows laptop now :/

768 gigs of RAM <br>this number will ring in my mind as far as I could live

768 gigs of RAM

&quot;the new macbook pro- one less dongle to carry&quot;<br>                                                                           -MKBHD

Lg V series phones are really good with those types of headphones.
768 gigs of ram!
Great review as always

Oooo Tetra by C2C, amazing album

I like the top notch and I think after I mac&#39;s including a notch.
Function keys are back baby! Finally usable for pros again. Pros want hotkeys. Not a flashy useless touchbar. I&#39;ll stand by this forever

Stupidly, it makes me wish I had some sort of media/entertainment creation job so I could justify getting one of these lmao


I am a bit nit picking here but you&#39;re grammatically incorrect by saying, &quot;super quickly and reliably&quot;. It should be super quick and reliable! Or else reliably super quick!


Your review is 50% complete.

Hope next time apple designers make a better job and hide the whole front camera block in the bottom thicker bezel and make left, right and top bezel as thin as possible. I can write a whole list of what can make these cool laptops nearly perfect for a much wider group of potential users/customers, hire me bitches! :0 Any way apple did a good job, I would buy a new one but sorry Tim, I am broke as f...k


why isn&#39;t there a video render asic?
Liked right after that amazing intro 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻



Dude, you did an excellent review.Bravo.


Thicc with benefits


The notch is a tribute to how powerful these devices are 😁

Please Apple, make the iMac Pro as well as these macbooks, OH PLEASE !!!!! Maybe a non-glare nano-etched screen wouldn&#39;t be too much to ask...

Would of been nice to have the numbers up for the M1 that we all already own for reference and comparison to the numbers of these 2 new chips.
The little Groot… was killin‘it 😂


Notch is still ugly af though...deserves marks off for that.  At least they finally caved and brought back the ports...after they over charge for hubs and adapters...

See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m50s">18:50</a> I sure like the thinner macbooks; these are THICK. Other than that, these are GREAT. I can&#39;t wait for the iMac Pro M1Max !!!!

a great example of recursion for the younger generation of programmers on how you review how you review

Finally they understood pros need ports.

Steve Jobs would have never allowed a notch


Soon we will see MacBook Pro mining Bitcoin 😉

Could the reason they excluded Face ID is that it struggles at distances. I notice that if I hold my phone more than an arms length away, it doesn’t always work.

i bought it and im a college student lol

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m47s">9:47</a> C2C is great Road Trip music

The Future is now

<b>prays that the upcoming M1 iMac doesn&#39;t have a notch</b>


One less dongle!


Your reviews are next level, Jesus!


Just got mine on Tuesday. Apple really did fix everything! The keyboard is a joy to use, the speakers actually sound really good for a laptop. I exported a few AF files and all of them were twice as fast as my M1 iMac. Battery is still kicking after 4 hours a messing around. This is by far the best laptop Apple ever made.


Can u plug your phone in on the power brink? That could help with really fast charging.

Nice laptops, nice review


What u mean the smallest machine that could render? Miniitx motherboard are small


S


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m12s">17:12</a> is that an error from the best YouTuber ever? I see twice M1 Pro reported with two different export times. I was there.


Mans just said “carrying an iMac” like it was a normal thing 🤣😂 brokenness


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> - spelling mistake. &quot;M1 Max&quot; instead of the M1 Pro for the export benchmark at the end.

next year they will bring back the light back in the apple logo :D


All these reviewers including MKBHD  would never care on the price tags  😇... all reviewers seem to be so excited as if it is a $ 200 laptop.. So basically they are reviewing the products for themselves  and hence Apple has the audacity to sell a cloth for $19 . Disappointed not with the review but the approach of apple for less privileged ppl.

Says the # 1 apple fanboy 😬😬

That magsafe connect click gave me goosebumps!
okok

Having every port running max wattage to drives battery is charging along with processor/screen running at full tilt can easily need over 100w.

Now this is a great 💻






<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m46s">8:46</a> thats some wallpaper there, this guy is good with his product  photography
How did it get thicker? I thought the idea was…thinner?




1.8k people didn&#39;t liked the video or the macbook?
Honestly, it feels like Steve Jobs is back.  These designs remind me of my old 2013 Macbook Pro.


Jesus

I love Touch Bar! That was the most creative thing on a laptop that I could use like iOS devices. I told Tim about it. Same time, I was so surprised that people are so conservative.
Should be called the Tim Cook MacBook.
While everyone flexing in youtube : I have ordered M1 Max 16 inch Macbook Pro with maxed out configuration..<br>Mkbhd : Well, I have 768 gigs off ram in my mac pro though🤑

You hurt me a lot when you put one Mac on another Mac, haha 😂

Does this mean that Johnny Ive was the one that removed the ports?

What???😱😱Did he just say 768 gigs of ram??🙄

GAF

I swear if Windows laptop start adding a notch I&#39;m just going to give up on humanity

Did he just... did he just say 768 GIGS of Ram?

I feel like there notch is there to help you open the lid so your not grabbing the screen...Any thoughts?

Yes i like that the ports are back

I work at best buy and I tried the demo and this was the best laptops I have ever used in my life, they are freaking amazing

You really became Shopping TV when it comes to Apple Products 👎

&quot;I only used final cut&quot; - Marques

What is the matt textured cover that you have on the macboooks?  Where do you get them? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=21m32s">21:32</a> .. Is that a sticker?

Does someone have $6,000 I can borrow?

Am I the only one who finds the new design ugly and prefer the old design?

1 thing I hate about all this reviews are how they often finds a reason to accept the shit Apple is throwing for the price. Not hating but it&#39;s disturbing.

2.4 million views in less than 24hrs.  Blows my mind.

I’m loving the braided cable for the magsafe!

I&#39;m going to college next year. Do you recommend I get a new computer now or wait until next year when the computer is better? Let me know if I should even get a Macbook Pro, or an Air.

Phenomenal Editing As Always❤️

These laptops are amazing but I cant afford that lol

I hope this macbook pro screen flex cable is strong enough, unlike its predecessors which often suffer from Led flexgate problems

Why are you calling the screen mini-LED and not OLED?

Please Apple, optimize the Autodesk suite for M1 Macs, the world isn&#39;t only about video and photo editing. I know, i can use Parallel with good performance but i don&#39;t like the idea of spending $3000+ for a Mac and then run Windows every time i need to work.

I don&#39;t like that when I type on the keyboard I have to rest my hands on the trackpad :/

When he says first computer he could take with him to do the job I&#39;m confused. Wouldnt a nice spec&#39;d out gaming laptop run circles around this?

Saw the Beyerdynamic and clicked. Stayed because it was a MKBHD video.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=11m47s">11:47</a> -- Lmao, yeah.... &quot;Apple comes out with something everyone else did but when they release it they do it better with no issue,&quot; 😅🤣 okay Fanboys

WOOH that intro hit hard, used to listen to Calling Crows everyday on my 2 hour commute to school!

Im not noticing as much of a difference with Premiere Pro as expected. Is it possibly because Adobe hasn’t updated for Silicon?

Wowwww soooo you had me at ports. Sold!

So you don&#39;t have to carry a dongle for high impedence headphones, but you have to carry it for a USB-A pendrive. That&#39;s logic...

Flash-forward to telling your grandkids in 2061 “back in my day I used to carry my portable editing computer in a 32sqft pelican case across country”

videos rendered in M1 be called M1KBHD…. great video as always!

I love this video and can you make a video on the oneplus earbud pro&#39;s

BEATS FIT PRO please! You are the best to review those headsets.

Can’t wait to have an Apple Watch Max, so the holy trinity of Apple Max products can be completed

So in short he is saying. If you are a Pro….fessional then these are worth the price because it will be an investment in Reduce time spending processing your Project…….

Windows user and will never get a Mac but still watching

I was considering upgrading until “the notch” it’s the reason I still have an iPhone 8. It’s the worst!

I wonder what will happen when we install Windows 11,on MacBook pro?

Why do I think that now we need another review video of your Apple products reviews?

It’s good to see apple bringing ports back , the Mac book looks like a good package , maybe next year the notch will have Face ID ?

$50,000 28 core Mac Pro….how you didn’t choke when saying that (compared to a wildly cheaper, FASTER alternative)….you have quite the stomach Marques! Impressive - just all of it!

never heard fans spin up audibly on these laptops??? really???

Um, where can I get that NYC Subway Motherboard thingy???

the fact that macs are getting rewarded for doing 120 hz display is just a joke. honestly, its been around for so long and should be standard on their laptops...

Top notch? Gfys apple how anyone thought that was a good idea is beyond me, apple consumers are the stupidest people.

Marques could you please make a video how do you Edit YouTube and Instagram videos. Thank You!

An extraordinarily good informative review.

Hilarious, that a company can get so much praise by removing features after screwing customers because of crap design.

That Intro with the Music!!!1 (Chef’s Kiss)

So many error <br><br>1- 786gb Ram?<br>2- when explaining the video export time.   You simply write M1 Pro MBP twice for both pro and max <br><br>And I guess there a few more that I don’t remember now. <br><br>So boys and girl! Who says pros don’t make mistakes!?<br><br>Thanks @mkbhd for seriously doing this! Now people who see you as a perfectionist won’t try to run behind perfection and gain nothing. But at least do mistakes and become something 😉

How is it possible that HDMI is still NOT using usb-c as I/O? It only makes sense. HDMI group needs a little creativity in their company.

I&#39;m in the group that has a lot of money to spend and want a nice laptop. I&#39;m going to be replying to all my youtube comments like a pro 😎

Imagine liking the notch
Why does every reviewer on this planet assume that Macbook users are either video producers or coders. Why can&#39;t there be any reviews that consider other use cases like an engineer, doctor or an architect etc. Not everyone sits around and edits videos all day long unless iv missed the memo where it said that Macbook pros are just for YouTubers
this laptops are amazing, as marques said I can&#39;t wait to see M1 promac or whatever on the mac pro, i expect that to be a monster


So my last Mac was a 2014 MacBook Pro. My next one will be an m1 max and all I can say is….I am so glad I waited so the MagSafe power is back.mouth on top of that the sd is back. So, essentially, I skipped all the nonsense.
Hey kid, nobody uses Final Cut, use Premiere like a real man.
This video must have easily made apple at least a 5 milllion!!!
We need more info on the groot bonsai!
Did this man say 768GB RAM on the Mac? Tf!?


Great review! 🔥🔥👍🏻👍🏻


Imagine being able to run this puppy on windows 11
rare w for apple


I like the sleekness of last version; not terribly noticeable but still.
Why is this in my feed in 2031?... oh man it&#39;s so fun to look back at these old videos. Wow, I nearly forgot about having to RENDER. Ugh, sitting there &quot;waiting&quot; for it to &quot;finish&quot; what I already told it to do. <br><br>batteries... still a dissapointment.
Agreed.  Truly Next Level Laptop.  Keyboard, Screen, Speed, Ports, Sound Quality = WIN
Dang I wish I could buy one to replace this old 2010 laptop, good review as always!


The travel Apple Pro Display XDR  🙌🏼


hey remember all those ports we removed everybody needs? well we brought them back! all hail apple. Also no hdmi 2.1 on a 3k laptop...


apple is actually a joke


All lives matter.


So apple built a better Dell XPS


Truly next gen machine all thx to ARM’s incredible performance per Watt ratio and Apple’s superb tight HW &amp; SW integration. And yes, desktop Macs especially Mac Pro will be incredible, their chips will be around 20+ CPU cores with probably 64 GPU cores.<br>Thx for the review!


&quot;This shouldn&#39;t be a big deal&quot; is the Apple motto for releasing &quot;new&quot; features


This is going to sound stupid, but for a machine this fast, rivaling the fastest desktop machines, I wish there was an option to get more than 64GB. My regular workstation PC has 256GB, and usually that&#39;s far more than I need, but there are some programs that will use as much RAM as I can throw at them and they&#39;ve gone to 50-90% utilization. So, for me, 64GB might be too much of a step down to switch entirely. I&#39;m still getting one of these, a 16&quot; M1 Max w/64GB and 4TB, but mostly because I need to upgrade my laptop, which is already 4 years old now, not to replace my desktop.


How&#39;s the weight for the 16&quot; macbook pro? Is it comfortable for traveling?


Hi be had mine for a week edited on it for the first time yesterday. Was super smooth and rendered a 8 minute 1080p video in about 45 seconds. Screen is beautiful. Upgraded from a 2014 so a big leap forward for me


Apple&#39;s new MacOS on the macbook pro is actually pretty good this time around


Why you gotta be ripping on the socks and sandals combo smh


Spyros Panopoulos


Why do people dislike these videos? 🤯


1 Like for Socks and Sandles!


Im a music producer, i like this laptop alot, but its really bad that alot of plugins i use in my DAW doesnt support m1 chips.


&quot;M1 Max MacBook Pro Review: Truly Previous Level!&quot; fixed for you.<br><br>it&#39;s like we went back in time to 10 years ago. Wasting everything done on the last iterations AND without adding anything new, literally NOTHING.



RIP Touch Bar :( it was the only thing that no other company made and they got rid of it


Apple: remove ports<br>Apple fanboys: innovation<br>Apple: Re-add ports<br>Apple fan boys:Innovation


Can i have the 16 inch? it would be really generous of you ❤️😌


Why no faceID in this notch ?!


It’s as if Apple has been listening to MBK recommendations and has finally implemented many of them. Great review. MBK is number 1 when it comes to reviews


Every time I watch one of your videos, I can&#39;t stop looking at your beard. Lol. Just wanted that out.


Apple removes all the ports cuz it&#39;s cool... Then adds them back and everyone thinks it&#39;s so cool lmao.


Honestly i have to say, i have a theory that, apple could have done all the new specs on the iphones and macbooks since years ago, however why would they, apple only puts out new things when its needed, and hey it is making them big money


&quot;Top notch design&#39; I see what you did there comrade 😏


Why the hell is there a damn notch on a macbook pro? LMAO


I still miss the light-up Apple logo.


This guy went from Android fanboy to Apple sheep


I&#39;m excited to get the 14 inch 🤗


Looking forward to socks and sandals


Now it just needs a NIC. How can it really be a pro laptop with just wireless?


Keyboard doesn&#39;t look as nice anymore


Buying this to watch YouTube and twitch is insane but I see people do it


&quot;like Linus.&quot;     ROFLOL!


Time to update my 2013 MacBook Pro haha





Quality of this video is also truly next level




I find all of these MBP reviews skews to creatives impressions.

Review I’ve been waiting for!!


When it comes to upgraded ports: why didn&#39;t they just do it? Updated MacBook coming in a few months? Apple greed?


Bahahaha this is hilarious a notch.... on a computer, lol.


Next MBP Upgrade: <br>1. FaceID<br>2. Center Stage<br>3. SD UHS-III<br>4. HDMI 2.1<br>5. 4K Display <br>6. M2 Pro/Max<br><br>(Just Guessing)


I mean, yeah cool, but its still a no-go for me since I do a lot of 3D rendering. Especially if I have to render something in Cycles Blender OPTIX - CUDA acceleration (and that happens more and more due to Blender slowly becomming an industry standard) - will just kill the MAC.<br><br>PS: Yes, Blender will have METAL support in version 3.1, but I dont think the MAC has any chance to compete here.



These intro are nice


Jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj





The notch is bigger because when then they can release the face id version next year without needing to increase the size... I think thats the path they are heading. If they released a smaller size, then the &quot;update&quot; for next year would be face id... but they need more room.. so then they increase notch... see now it doesn&#39;t look like an upgrade anymore.


768 gb ram on your mac pro?! Wow ....





&quot;only 64 gigs of ram&quot; :)
They have some other plans for Notch for future models So they are starting to  add notch now.





Truly Next Level!


768gb ram???????





Ofc there&#39;s <b>that</b> guy who goes on twitter in all caps about the text going behind the notch.


Don&#39;t waste your money, if you are only checking email, writing papers viewing files and watching movies(99% of the Population) don&#39;t buy this money trap. If you are a pro and making money from using this divice, well, its an investment in your business. All that said, great review.





The apple 🍎 on the back of the computer needs to light up.  Lighting up 🌈 would be really cool.




This is the first MacBook I literally would and need to upgrade instantly over my 2015 mbp but this time, the issue I had is price. :) I hope they make a top notch discount next year.





Wait till you see the punch hole Samsung laptop


Omfg! ! MacBook Pro ICONS x Dbrand skin!!!!!!!!! Super cool! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=02m45s">02:45</a>
I see the Google pixel
Worth the wait. (is he talking about the MacBooks or the review?? The world may never know)
That intro tho????? That was SICK
Man, i been seeing this laptop everywhere and people saying how good this is, meanwhile, me, being good uncle gave my two laptops away to my nieces when they had to learn from home and now, i don&#39;t have a laptop, my desktops PSU just messed up 8 days ago, and now, i can&#39;t learn to code, thought about buying this..but shit its over $2000
I honestly would really miss 😭 the Touch Bar. I wished they kept it there and allowed me to customise it more, especially now that shortcuts is here.
Are we meant to give apple credit for adding stuff that they took away in the first place?


The only knock I see is Apple continuing the trend to be behind on wireless connectivity technology.  Wifi6E represents the first change in wireless spectrum available in over 20 years, more than doubling wireless changes available, and Apple missed this boat.  This will be the first time 80 and 160Mhz channels are realistically usable in enterprise dense WiFi deployments.  I am certainly biased as an enterprise network architect, but choosing to handicap wireless users to 50% speeds on upcoming enterprise networks is a big deal.  Think of it as doubling the time for your artist to upload completed projects to the enterprise servers.    Great all around product, but don&#39;t go cheap on the wireless.  The time to process work is only half of the equation.  We have to get the data off our systems to establish the collaborative environments we seek.  This is good, but could be great.
I just heard that the Pixel 6 series batteries aren&#39;t that bad.


I&#39;m still missing the days of experimentation on hardware. Making things really cool and unique. Companies are now copying other companies. I think this MBP is a great addition, and can&#39;t wait to see if something rather expected s upgraded via software updates.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m45s">7:45</a> The keys feels good and travel decently well, like they&#39;re keyboards from 5 years ago LOLOLOLOLOLOL


Great computer I must say but it&#39;s funny how YouTubers flipflop. When the touch bar came out it was awesome now it&#39;s gone it&#39;s great too hmmmm only your favourite brand .....


I hate Marques when says No Touch Bar is better. I love it it looks so cool though I would pay higher just to include this I think he started hating it, apple took in consideration :(
Where did you get that Android figurine?
Correction: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m36s">18:36</a> the graph does not compare with 3080 only 3070 and 3060
I just watch MKBHD videos for the intros


The excitement is noticeable
Looks pretty good I actually would get one if it wasnt so expensive, and ran Mac OS.


&quot;So, there will be a lot of professionals like me who are really happy with these. There is also gonna be a lot of people who totally dont need this power but just have a lot of money to spend and just want to get a nice laptop&quot;. There is no better way to describe it.























I was surprised not to come with a 10Gbps option in the brick. I had to buy a Thunderbolt 3 one which consumes one of the ports.


I have to say that I forgot about the notch 10 minutes into using mine. I only remember it when other people bring it up in videos or on twitter. 😉


I&#39;ve been for this so loong. finally out. the review I can really trust let&#39;s hear what marques have to say about the new beast


Nice arm chips are the future


I need a Mac book...any fairly used one I&#39;ll appreciate



Not clear if you will start editing videos on a laptop... 🤔


Hello guys! I am a proud owner of a Macbook Air 2020 M1 - I have problems with downloading the new monterey update. I also experienced problems with Small Big Sur updates. When i am about to dowload Monterey it goes from 60 min to 52 min and stays on 52 for a long period of time but then it suddenly drop to 39 min and then the last 39 min get downloaded in like 10 seconds and it fail to download. Anyone know what the problem is? And yes i have reseached on google but my luck wasnt with me;)
Watched this on my 14&quot; Macbook Pro that just came today. First Mac laptop I&#39;ve ever owned. I&#39;ll use it alongside my iMac at home and my Mini at work.
The notch is ugly af
What&#39;s your Pixel 6 Pro home screen set-up? Can we get some screenshots?
The next computer up Apple will put usb 2.1 and add a £1000.00. I bought an M1 MacBook and it&#39;s just not worth what I paid for it. 2 port sigh, Apple have us fooled.


On the performance section it’s M1 Max MBP that gets the lowest time. Not the M1 Pro


Jesus just thinking of having to lug around an entire Mac computer sounds annoyingly painful.
I want one but I can&#39;t afford it right now ;_;
Not buying notch book
What&#39;s with all the shaky cam? It&#39;s so distracting.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> the bottom line should be M1 Max MBP
love the Groot ester egg
The notch not being patched is actually a dealbreaker for me. A lot of the programs I use have menus that cover the entire top bar with drop downs. I cannot believe how lazy they were with their implementation. Also TF no touchscreen? Their excuses are so weak, if they actually coded in proper multitouch it would almost be the perfect laptop


Apple could start selling Qtips for 100$ and this guy would call them “next level”.

As long as it&#39;s just the notch...I&#39;m ok with all I&#39;m getting (back). No TouchBar, (hopefully) working keyboard, Full-size HDMI port, SD-card slot, MagSafe, CPU/GPU Power with no fan noise...In some cases I even have 1 Thunderbolt port more when I connect my 38&quot; display via HDMI and use the SD-card slot. Before it required two dongles and occupied two ports (so two left), now I have three left. So if they improve the software handling for the notch, like optional multiline toolbar or similar I&#39;m totally happy.


This is incredible to hear!


I have to ask, why are reviewers always giving Apple a pass when their latest stuff comes out with old standards
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> man those names are confusing, but the lists says &quot;M1 Pro MBP&quot; where it should say &quot;M1 Max...&quot;


Did Marques just say 768gb of ram, or did I hear wrong?


u never heard the speakers of ASUS n550 jx   best ever




Takes MKBHD to made product shots of Apple products better than Apple do themselves




Why does he buy super expensive 8k red cameras for YouTube videos that will never show the quality of the camera?<br><br>Why would a tech channel need a cinema grade camera in the first place?<br><br>Maybe he should learn basic tech info before making a video? Like how he confused dac with an amp.





Imagine he was Carrying mac the dog while travelling was actually mind blowing😂


Those export times are absolutely insane. Beating a $50,000 completely specd out Mac Pro is mindboggling.


the only reason I still haven&#39;t bought one is they dont support virtualization yet too well. Hopefully this comes soon!! Very cool laptops




I look at the external and think &quot;welcome to mid 2015&quot;.  But the internal more than makes up for it from what I keep hearing.  I still only have my mid-2015 MacBook pro - it&#39;s enough for me.





You can always tell where in the US Marques is from when he says the word &quot;various&quot; haha
a mac pro m1 desktop will reach a ridicolous level of performance. your own supercomputer for home.





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m50s">8:50</a> is this Athens Greece?
it is not that the M1 is really good(it is good). It is that that all previous Apple products sucked!!! Open you minds.......
i wonder how these compete against AMD apu&#39;s
Marques, thank you for being the most even keeled, helpful reviewer out there. Just ordered my maxed Macbook after your review and feeln pretty stoked about it handling my new file management needs with the Nikon Z9. First big computer purchase in years, and been following you for many of those. 100%
What about the lit up logo am i the only one who wants that back that was literally one of the coolest designs
That baby groot stood so still I almost didn&#39;t see him 😮
Apple product and next gen should never be mentioned in the same sentence. Ever!
I&#39;m a software engineer, still a student, and I make some YouTube videos on the side. I think I could buy this and not blink about my laptop for years so I like that idea of buying 1 laptop, top of the line, and not worryimg for years.


So you could pretty much get a dock for the MacBook Pro and get rid of the Mac Pro


Instead of lugging your old Mac OSX please send it to me. You can stay with M1. Thank you in advance.
After Effects is doing multiframe CPU rendering, not GPU. Some effects use GPU. But was a great review Marques.
2022 new MacBook Pro M2 Max will have a 2.1 HDMI and a thinner notch, and don&#39;t forget they will probably add USB ports
Totally respect your comment about not gaming on a Mac. I will say though, for what it&#39;s worth, my 2019 MacBook Pro 16&quot; cranks out Cyberpunk 2077 at max everything and remains very smooth. I don&#39;t like playing with everything maxed though, so I cut some stuff down to a reasonable level, and it&#39;s still amazing looking and runs like butter. That&#39;s on Windows via Bootcamp though. On the Mac side, I do a lot of Steam gaming on it, mostly single player games - I don&#39;t keep up with the Fortnites and the Overwatches and all that), but the most recent thing I played was Soma, and I was able to run that at max graphics and specs 60fps. So for those people out there who say you <b>can&#39;t</b> play games on a Mac, I urge you to give it a shot, you might be surprised. That said, I do a lot of my Windows-based steam games on a Linux machine now.
As long as reviewers and apple fans will condone this useless notch stupid trend, we deserved  to be treated as stupid consumers audiences that would buy anything at any point at any cost.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m17s">2:17</a> Not hating but it definitely feels like a dated look.
760 GB of ram 🤯🤯
man is like 2006 WHICH is good lol




I&#39;m hoping that all the Apple reviewers start releasing content with HDR now 😀
The 120 that isn’t really 120 is frustrating.




I upgraded from a base 2014 13 inch MacBook Pro to the base 14 inch MacBook Pro and it&#39;s such a great upgrade. my 2014 still technically worked fine but the battery needed to be replaced and it was starting to get so slow. I&#39;m still impressed with how long it lasted and I&#39;m interested to see how long I can get out of the new one





Fantastic review! Thank you.
It’s the rocket douche on the desk for me 😹




Do an updated everyday carry video now that you’ve dropped the iMac Pro lol 💪
I am on a 2012 MacBook Pro with an I 716 gig ram. I got a 2 TB SSD. That’s relatively new. I had a 1 TB SSD before that. I am so sick of my computer it’s been a great computer but now it’s constantly running slow I’ve got the rainbow wheel spinning a lot and I don’t know how to fix it. I have clean my Mac I constantly wipe the ram I route reboot the computer often but it still just runs slow it’s specially when I’m doing video calls and that sort of thing. I’m thinking of buying the new M1 14 inch but I’d really like some opinions I would like to max out the ram since I’ll never be able to add ram again but to do that I’ve got to go up one step in a processor and I want a 2 TB SSD because I have run out with a 1 TB in the past. All that puts me at around $3800 before the Apple care warranty. It’s just unbelievable to think of spending four grand on a laptop but I use it as a desktop I fold it up and I have a big wide screen monitor and I use it every day for work 8 to 10 hours a day and when I’m not at work I’m on the computer watching YouTube videos and whatever else so most of my life is spent on this computer hence I’m thinking go all in. Finally one last thing and I would love anyone’s opinion after reading this. I’m the type of guy that will try and keep a device whether it be at the laptop or phone or whatever as long as possible. I am not the guy that upgrades an iPhone every year or two years. I currently have an iPhone 12 Pro I got that about six months ago prior to that I had a 6S. And it works great but it was finally time to upgrade. So I plan on keeping this is absolutely long as possible that’s why I’m thinking of going to 64 gig of RAM. I can’t stand that they will allow you to update the ram later or the drive. They force you to buy their expensive SSD drives. Anyway anyone who would like to give me their thoughts please do.Thank you
Top notch 🤣 wordplay huh

Apple would say they aren’t laptops they are portables


&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day&quot; that is either a random comment. Or a REALLY deep tech dig to Linus Sebastian of Linus Tech Tips who notoriously wears socks and sandals and I forget exactly what he said but he called out that he didn&#39;t thing FaceId was coming and that people who disagreed weren&#39;t thinking straight.




Your videos are best in class.  Seriously.  Thanks.  Also, I&#39;m guessing no ethernet in the brick because usually when you are on wired ethernet you are at home or at work (not in a cafe or on the go) and when you are at home or at work you are plugged into a dock with monitors and drives, etc.  And all docks have ethernet.   So I am guessing that most people would never use it.


The joy on Marques face looking at the Keyboard with no touchbar. Dead!




For that price I still prefer my LG Gram 17&#39;




at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m05s">17:05</a> the label says M1 pro when he meant M1 Max actually






Unfortunately Autodesk has no interest in usable mac versions of their products, sigh6




Great review, but now my $4500 2020 16&quot; Intel MBP is officially archaic. Thanks again, Apple. Talk about cancel culture.
That intro/beat is 🔥! Amazing....





Another thing that is next level: your reviews. Great comprehensive review with a lot of relevant takes. I’d rather wait for this review than have a rushed lesser one.
Who wants mkbhd to do the Linus sandles and socks look 😅😉. I&#39;m excited 🤣




I literally just got a new macbook pro a month and a half ago and im sorta hurt lmao


the fast charge is ridiculously good on these laptops.





Why the SD Card Sticks out sooo much!?!<br><br><br>And why doesn’t Marquess points that out!?




<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m56s">3:56</a> log 4 life!


at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m57s">16:57</a> did he mean to write M1 Max instead of M1 Pro? He also said max lol




I have been waiting for this video for a long time 🙏





Just blows me away this new performance level!





Just for fun I installed heroes of the storm (one of the few games for macOS) and running through Rosetta I can run my M1 Max 64GB ram at extreme settings between 60-90fps at full resolution


Marc can I get one🥺🥺🥺







I bet they are only holding out on Face ID for a big feature grab for next release. It’s so fast it would read your face and open all in a flip so it was dumb of them not to.


Your review was one of the best and unique. Keep it up!


Wow, that intro was amazing!  Great job!


What’s the weight ?





Did the Mac Pro really cost 50K?


Thank you for acknowledging us, lol <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=21m52s">21:52</a>


It&#39;s not the DAC you need for the high impedance (though often DAC is coupled with) is a pre-amplifier.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m05s">17:05</a><br><br>Was the last one meant to be “ M1 Max MBP “


I am heavily considering a 16” to replace my Hackintosh. Get a docking station set up to use all my desktop peripherals and I’m set. I got to try a 14” yesterday and I was sold almost immediately. Too bad I’m not in a position to buy one at the moment, but soon hopefully.


Man.... The way apple loves the way you give them advertising is just unfair.


You still have that skill share class up right?


&quot;it&#39;s less than a quarter of a second&quot;<br>Like you can count the milliseconds just by looking at the video play...smh<br>Come on man!!


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m00s">4:00</a>  I just got a pair of Space Gray Homepod Minis, which have nice dark braided power cables....and big WHITE wall warts.  No idea why the plug doesn&#39;t match the rest of the homepod.


What about the entry level 14 m1 pro? Is that worth the money?


This video feels like a movie


I have absolutely no need for the power that this laptop offers, but damned if I don&#39;t want it.


You carry an iMac while traveling 😂😂 <br>Well hot dog !!


Is it bad that I trust the quality of his reviews so much I hit like before the intro music is even done.


Does low power mode offset any battery life duration between the M1 Max and the M1 Pro?


Kinda remind me of a Nintendo DS


Love the video, it&#39;s just sucks that it&#39;s way out of my price range.


768gb ram lmao


It seems like this pinch is equivelant to take what you can get.


Great review!


As much as I love that apple actually listened to their customers for once, I will whole heartedly rail anyone I see using this that is clearly just the average joe blow lol. This is apples first truly pro device, with a pro price tag, and absolutely 0 reason for the average person to drop $3,000 on a laptop that can’t even run games without a lot of porting. Still an amazing machine, just only for a very specific few people




(sound quality is not improved from external dac/amp)


Profile reminds me of a toilet


And bam, iPad Pro M1 Max with actual macOS. <b>dream</b>


Did anybody notice that apple was going for thinner design when they knew the Intel chips take a lot power but now when they are equiping thier own chip which 4x more power efficient but now they are going for thick design either they really learned their lesson or may be they wanted to make intel look bad... just saying

my only complain with macbook pro is  the removal of the touchbar and a lot thicker which I know is functionally better but idk i just loved that thin design

somewhere i feel the quality of video is not upto the par of THE MKBHD, like explaining abt ports etc.

Great soecs. But a notch on a laptop? Come on apple.
Bro it&#39;s such a good laptop but the minimum price is like 5600

Top notch design 🤣🤣🤣
I feel like the only issue was logic pro plugins but I don&#39;t know where that is now.
I just loathe camera notches and punchouts. Take the ROG Phone 5S, for instance. Bezels serve a useful function. I dislike having unusable screen real estate. I&#39;m also curious how locked down these new M1 Macs are for other OSes. I&#39;d expect Linux to be the easier to port over, and I expect Windows will be completely incompatible. Good job, Apple. You got your locked-down ecosystem to spread to your computers at long last.

the real question is:<br>how good is it for excel?

“Socks and sandals… like Linus” Loved it! 😂

🔥🔥🔥🔥
Unbox Therapy still be like: MacBook Pro has MAJOR flaws
That intro man that intro.
where did u get that cube yo
Why is that people have to choose between a computer and their rent?
the quality and the structure is just amazing
Did he just say 768 GIGS of RAM?
worst looking ever
The audio waveform not displaying the waveforms is an old issue that people have been complaining about for ages.
Why can´t these machines support CAD or FEM stuff? I have the feeling apple is just designing their products for video editors.
Nice video. Soooo much wished I could boot camp these machines. As a MS developer I just don’t think parallels is going to cut it. Such a shame as these are way nicer hardware than any dell/Lenovo etc.
It worries me that taking scissors to a square screen to chop a piece out is part of a &quot;design language&quot;.
finally
buying one for my mom
Amazing review.  Great work.
I&#39;m just excited to see the performance on apple silicon mac pros when they come out. It would be insane

@Marques Brownlee you have a typo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m10s">17:10</a> it should say on the bottom one &quot;M1 Max MBP&quot; instead of &quot;M1 Pro MBP&quot;
2021 or 2027 ???   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m21s">0:21</a>
Duuuuude! about time Marques. I have been waiting for you to upload this video. Now I can finally make a decision, btw the man tells it like it is and that is &quot;Next Level&quot; baby.
Great review as always
Love it!!! have mine on order! so freaking excited! Definitely the most excited I&#39;ve been for any product in a freaking long time!!! I do find it a bit funny that the new Macbook Pros look a looooot like a G4 Powerbook I had  way back in the day. Not complaining, since those ports are super nice to have back, but it is funny the design is so early 2000&#39;s again. Also I travel with my iMac for work too. Glad to know I&#39;m not alone.
RIP Intel, these M1 step up, remind me, when we are switching to SSD.

is it just me or the new macbook pros&#39; hinge are extremely loose coming out of the box. its ever looser than my 2013 macbook pro.
The was no doubt MKBHD was under a lot of pressure to deliver the long awaited and much anticipated Macbook Pro review and just like the M1 Pro/Max Macbooks themselves, he and his team delivered seemingly without even breaking a sweat. Great review.
Why can&#39;t we have the same fun on Windows laptop
Apple takes something away and people praise it when it returns. Can&#39;t wait to celebrate the headphone jack with it returns on Phone 15.
did you just say your mac pro has 768GB of RAM??

Can&#39;t use LAG as an excuse now. SMH
6k later 😿

The M1 Pro Max 16&quot; is like going from DOS to Windows. Or from Windows to OS X. From VHS to bluray.  Can&#39;t use the Intel one any more the speed difference is insane.
Lol I wish I could afford one of these new laptops!

Dude as a diehard windows person, I have a 14&quot; M1 pro 10c on order cause that thing is just too good to say no to.
I want nothing more than to afford a fully spec’d 16in MacBook Pro Max. <br>My 2014 laptop is on its last legs.
I am a loyal follower of yours, why do you say Jesus at @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m06s">18:06</a>? This affects me as a Christian. Despite this thank you for your review and God bless you!
People, It&#39;s a MacBook Pro in at least 5 years of making. What the hell did you people expect, other than best performance out there? :/ Like anybody would come out with technology that somehow is worst than its predecessors.
Hey MKBHD where can I find that potted groot plant?? Love the review BTW!
For real pros these are tools. For consumers these are toys for rich people.
price?

I feel like I&#39;ve seen every mac / tech reviewer out there and never came across this channel before. I really enjoyed watching/listening.
Good review and usage information, thanks!
No touchbar - horray!
Predisposition to wearing glasses... check your eye asap
The notch is unacceptable, Jobs turning in his grave
Yeah, yeah, new silicon so exciting. Magsafe and more I/O!
Good review and great laptop. I ordered one yesterday. I am a little disappointed though that the screen is only 500 nits with SDR content. I&#39;m a developer, not a video editor, and finally having a laptop that would alowe me code outside, comfortably, was the main thing I was excited about.. I REALLY hope they will decide to add a &#39;work-outside&#39; feature, where you can up the nits level more.





the moment i saw how thick it was, it was a total no-go for me
thank you for this video, it&#39;s absolutely perfect !
cool it has nice hardware now the only bad thing is the horrendous software
i´ve got a question, in previous Macbook pro models, the edge of every key was aluminum, the black edge? is plastic?
OK, in the competition to see who drags the silliest, bulkiest, clumsiest equipment package with them, I though I was a contender. But, no, you win!! And I am referring to my photographic camera equipment compared to your computer equipment!!!
❤️🔥
how come you&#39;re using DropBox?
768 GB of RAM? <br>say what now?
Just a tool? 🧐 stolen from the other guy… like it.
Even Mac Mini Pro and iMac Pro will be impressive. Not everyone needs a portable workstation when a desktop workstation is all they need.
The display is too thin to have FaceID. If you want FaceID you want a thicker display
amazing
While Ethernet in your power chord sounds nice, it could be really annoying to have to find a power outlet just to use an ethernet connection. <br><br>On the iMac it makes sense as you have to have to be plugged into power to turn on the computer, but on a laptop it doesn’t really solve a dongle problem when the power chord combination just becomes a massive dongle. A simple usb-c to ethernet dongle is simpler, smaller, cleaner and cheaper.

&quot;The thinner besels <b>*all*</b> around are long over due&quot;  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m06s">9:06</a>

I&#39;m coming from a 2015 MacBook Pro that&#39;s been put through the ringer. Definitely saving up to get the new 16 inch, can&#39;t wait!
Bro, me have ,obey like you, so I will soil myself.. one life, and can’t take it with me. Great review.
New iMac Pro max pros laptops are very nice because it is mostly everything about All ports of this laptops.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m29s">2:29</a> add something to your product that everyone likes in this case ports (you know the thing people need to operate the device), then take it away to create a &quot;problem&quot;, than introduce it a couple years later as a &quot;solution&quot;. which than attracts more idiots to buy the product beause they then think it&#39;s an improvment or solution to their problem. simply buisness cycle rinse and repeat
Why does this guy need such a  powerful computer for making youtube videos about tech reviews?
Is it just me, or does this video feel like an ad.. just a bit?<br>I mean.. the product visibly has some cons on the video, but otherwise the video wouldn&#39;t look so convincing. Isn&#39;t it where apple marketing budgets are also going?
Carrying that giant case everywhere is true dedication to your job 😂


Man I thought that was a mark on my iPad screen for about 20 seconds until I realised it was on your wall by your head 😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m57s">16:57</a><br><br>What.<br><br>Edit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m02s">18:02</a><br><br>What.
Im a fan but MB talking some serious BS in the first 60 seconds of this video. Have you seen what you can fit into a itx case these days? Been drinking the apple cool aid too long.
But...
finally
Why to much lip smacking (sorry)
Marques following khaby trend...😂😂💯
In laptops , apple is really the best for what they offer
does apples pays you to? XD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m18s">20:18</a> Get a kiss from Marques 😂😂
Amazing machine.<br>As for the notch, admittedly, it doesn&#39;t look too bad or intrusive here but it is unfortunate that Apple have adopted it (the notch) as their design cue. Why would anyone promote an intrusion on a display as a good thing? I&#39;ve seen a render of a new Air with white bezels and a white notch. If that abomination hits the light of day, Steve Jobs quote of Microsoft having no taste would be extremely ironic.
&quot;Only has 64gb of RAM, while my main machine has 768gb of RAM&quot;  ...must be nice!

just curious is there an option to make the menu bar black 100% of the time? i feel like that would solve the problem with the notch save for the 0.01% of times it doesnt.
reviewing macbook when the other hand with pixel 6 its comes something to me.
would internet work through magsafe because you said you wanted ethernet on the power brick but it wouldnt work
MacBook 2021: re-released the useful ports and removed the useless TouchBar, INNOVATION
Apple IMO have real opportunity to build tools for game engines so that games can be run on these machines, when we try to find light weight gaming laptops we always end up compromised machines due to thermal limitations. I wish Apple put some of its trillion dollars towards gaming community too.





Imagine paying thousands for a laptop that doesn’t even have Ethernet 😀😂

There&#39;s 4 TB4 PCIe4 channels. It&#39;s likely that the fourth one is likely split between the HDMI port and SD card reader, other peripherals possibly too. HDMI 2.1 utilises up to 48Gb and TB4 has a 40Gb channel. 🙄The SD card may only be using a lane or two... Some of the HDMI 2.1 benefits wouldn&#39;t be there.
768 GB of RAM in his Mac Pro 🤤
How do you add 700+ gigs of ram if apple only offers up to 64g
Those poor devs won&#39;t get their &quot;compiling breaks&quot; anymore.
not gonna talk about Meta &amp; zucc?
<b>Just imagine Mac Pro M1 with SOLDERED COMPLETELY EVERYTHING !!!</b>
The 16&quot; looked pretty big on MKBHD&#39;s lap, and I have a 17&quot; laptop (and am considerably smaller).
Loved this review! Thanks a ton! And your effects during the intro were amazing!
Krispy 🥰

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a> Isn’t that supposed to say M1 Max?
Marques, it&#39;s a bit hard to build Ethernet into a charger that&#39;s no longer connecting to the device with USB-C 😉<br>I think people can live with a dongle/docking station for Ethernet.
Correction: you have to carry around an AMP when using high impedance headphones, not a DAC.

im sitting here thinking of switching to the s22 ultra when it comes out and now im thinking of staying apple only for the macbook. but, i can have an android phone and macbook with no problem. so idk lol
I have the lowest end 16 inch. Walked into the Apple Store the other day before a job and said F it and picked one up. I had last years M1 13 in MBP and this is miles ahead of it. I don&#39;t use it for much else than shooting photos to it and it&#39;s more than capable to run Capture One, Photoshop and Lightroom. If this will be your only machine I would suggest getting one of the beefier ones. But I am more than happy to use this.
The ugliest laptop ever
Not sure if this is ad or review
unfortunately it still runs macOS, we desperately need a windows competitor to this
Please reduce background noise in your vids
That intro. Fire.
Bro these intros are becoming better than apples reveals 😳
I just want to play games…
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m50s">16:50</a> Pixel 6 babyyy 😏
Wow 😯 Awesome 🤩
when you get used to the old macbooks, these look so thick
This is the only review for which I waited. It has the context and substance I needed.
&quot;Not something they do all the time&quot;<br><br>Yeah, so they fucked up with the Touchbar and we got a fix. The only unforgivable part for me is the fucking butterfly keyboard - that thing was a piece of shit on day one.<br><br>Btw your socks and sandals threat is BS. You don&#39;t actually want Face ID because the thing has Touch ID which is better - just like on the iPhone, so yada yada yada, no one believes your BS.
I do day-of video edits and animations for music festivals and our team does the exact same thing - traveling with an iMac in a pelican case lol. Sufficed to say we&#39;re all getting the new MBPs and stoked to be able to finally leave the iMac at home
Marques, you mentioned possibly needing a  external DAC, did Apple by any chance put a DAC in the M1 MAX? That would be really good. A good DAC is meant for a good high end headphones.

That notch is killing me
apple should use that intro as an ad
I&#39;ve seen you hauling that thing through O&#39;Hare so many goddamn times lolol 😆😆😆
How can this not have Face ID???
None of these &quot;pros&quot; will change the fact that, this notch is the stupidest thing ever happened to a laptop...
Where to geht the NYC subway LED Panel? Super lit
If they had used GaN technology those powerbricks would be half the size. 😮‍💨
Another fourth thunderbolt port would be nice.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m11s">17:11</a> it should be M1 Max at the bottom
What will happen when they will came with their new m1 pro IMAC
Hate the HDMI port.
The only review I was looking forward to.
the notch looks terrible
No comment
It&#39;s a shame these things are utterly useless for professional development. Not having an x86 version instantly disqualifies it from any serious Docker/compilation work.
I HATE that notch.
Soo elephant in the room... How it runs Minecraft? :D
is there an audio sync out in the whole video?? Or is it my internet just:p
768GB RAM?! WTF
Can&#39;t wait to see mkbhd on socks and sandals 😂😂
&quot;There is no way the noch needed to be this big for that hardware&quot;... Someone reminds me if this guy is : a DESIGNER?
I had to go with M1 Max on my 14 inch, so I could use 4 external monitors. Kinda wish eGPU support was a thing, since I’ve got 6 monitors currently via old MBP 2018. Highly niche use case though.

remove everything then return everything - next level
ngl these M1pro/max laptops are not aesthetically pleasing at all :/ I was thinking of upgrading from my 2020 pro, but I&#39;ll pass
Can yall PLEASE release a &quot;how to&quot; for the intro because that was insane. Either on here or on The Studio because that was awesome
He&#39;s trying so hard to defend and justify the notch...its hilarious.<br><br>No USB port....are you kidding me??<br>And People are celebrating this ??

Could this these new MacBook Pro&#39;s support a 5K 120hz panel if Apple were to make one?
Is that a picture of your sister?
The Touch Bar would make this MacBook more cleaner

I knew it! I knew that the bullcrap slimming trend of laptops wasn&#39;t a sustainable engineering path. How are you gonna cool the machine that is consuming more and more power with each generation effectively with using a smaller and smaller heat dissipation system? There is no magical innovation aside  that does this, thermodynamics is a well established and stable science and there have been no practical physics breakthroughs in that field for many years. If you have less and less space something is getting stressed (whether its the fan motor running at a much higher speed, or the processor having to be capped in it&#39;s clock or be constantly throttled to minimize heat output so the fan and heat sink can sustainably handle the load without the CPU overheating). It&#39;s always a tradeoff. The problem with apple is that they focused too hard on aesthetics and idiot consumers blindly buy into it paying a premium price. Everyone with half a brain cell knew that removing the ports was a stupid decision. Why is everyone praising Apple for bringing then back? They clearly made an obvious mistake that idiot fans were trying to find a way to justify it. Whenever you buy from apple you never get the best in terms of pure  computational capacity per dollar.
If you are into crypto make a video about shiba inu 📹📹📹😏
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a> - &quot;So these laptops have a new top-notch design&quot;.  LOL!
Like Linus lol
It&#39;s got a next level NOTCH. lol. I don&#39;t get how people are accepting this crap.
Perfect time for me to get a MacBook Pro. Well finally
The intro😍😍
Jony ive punching the air right now
Next year MacBook 20% smaller notch
Hate the notch. Love the Daft Punk glove at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m28s">7:28</a>
&quot;Top notch design&quot; had me laughing hardcore xD A very nice one there, Marques!
Dude just get a AWS server and upload your videos there and then you can ask your friends at your office to edit it...
768 gigs of RAM.<br>I dont have that much storage in mine.
you&#39;re the best in the bizz marques. thank you man.
What about animation using blender rendering
pls marques
can we get dedicated LR/PS cores too? lol
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m11s">17:11</a> we have a problem, m1 max instead of m1 pro at the text on the final cut export
This may have been the first time Jesus was mention on this Channel 😂
Next year they will remove the notch and it&#39;ll be a selling point
Awesome review. Thanks for the link to the tee :P
Watching this from my mid 2010 Macbook Pro, maybe someday I&#39;ll have the money to upgrade 😅
still no touch screen,... why apple?
GROOT
looks amazing even tho I know I will never be able to afford it lol
It has ports 🤣
Thank you! People have ridiculed me for complaining about no colour matched MagSafe
🤬
I did a car show a few years back and the social media team they hired turned up with two massive Mac Pros to crunch their videos as quickly as possible. I bet they could use an M1 Max to streamline things.
JESUS! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m05s">18:05</a> - That is a real reaction.
That human bonsai at your back got me 🤣😂
can i get a m1 at window\
Bro. Go and get a fade. Yo shit is looking nappy
why not just get a powerful PC laptop for half the price?
yes, $5k laptop with the specs of a $500 HP laptop from Walmart lmao fuck apple
Mate, Max Tech and other channels already reviewed almost all the models in every benchmark possible against macs AND PCs.


next level with the stupid notch that don&#39;t even have face id
Y adding Face ID when we still gotta dooble press the power button to confirm any purchase? It’s like two steps to do one simple task with touch id
Why are you hitting delete with middle finger?
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m05s">18:05</a> Blessed Be Jesus&#39;s holy name.
Happy to see a Pixel in your hands as a daily driver again.
Great presentation
I even cleaned my monitor screen before watching this
Carrying around a maxed out iMac just so you can render videos in 4k overnight is ridiculous and so extra... 90% of your viewers are probably still using 1080p monitors. Like wtf

Why am I watching this, I can&#39;t even afford a MacBook from 2012.
I think the notch in this one is stupid, but, in general, I like it
Just waiting for the disk drive now
Honestly no issues with the notch.  Face ID needs to be a thing tho 100%
Top notch design...HA!!
Perfect review. Thanks! 😎👍🏼
who needs MagSafe when we have usb c?
IDGAF how much it is i just got one, because I want one 😂😂
It doesn’t matter if he uploads his videos late, we’ll still see it.
living for the aespa references
Okay
This video is annoying after i just bought my mac last year n have to walk around with dongles!
next level of disappointment
Cool stuff mate.
I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day..😂…like Linus 😂😂
What would you do with $50,000 Mac Pro? Just curious?
Are you and 20syl besties or something
I can&#39;t even afford a pair of Airpods 1st Gen so what am I doing here?<br><br>Enjoying that intro that is!
Are these the same design as previous M1 where a lot of users find the screens broken without any reason. Is it safe to buy or same design flaw is there and should we fear the screen will crack overnight without any cause?

so basically...size matters!
The one thing I don’t like, is that as of yet you can’t run x86 VMs on it. And I understand this of course because the chip is different, however it’s a huge drawback for me as I use those VMs a lot for forensic and pentesting.


I have listened to many reviews while waitng for yours.  So I too have come to depend on.your reviews.   That said, I snagged the 14inch MBP 1TB to downsize and upgrade from my 2013 Imac.  I luv it!!!
When is the Beats Fit Pro review comming?!?!
Targeted my socks and sandles. It&#39;s cold rn
+1
Except the M1 chip seems to have lots of issues with Adobe Creative Cloud. Yes, it&#39;s great to have the ports back but what a surprise that Apple alters the MagSafe charger yet again so everyone needs to buy a new charger and more importantly throw their old ones away. Apple still wants to rinse us all.




Yeah, the M1&#39;s are certainly mind-blowing on all levels; especially the M1 Pro and the M1 Max. I bought the M1 Macbook Air and the M1 MacMini with 16GB RAM and 512 SSD earlier this year. I have been absolutely blown away by the performance, efficiency of the M1&#39;s cores, and the quietness by which these units run. So far they both have been able to handle all my web development projects without a hitch. It does make me excited knowing that if I need more power and flexibility Apple&#39;s silicon Mac product selection now has me covered.







Hoping you make a review on the beats fit pro
I&#39;m waiting to have those laptops available in Mexico. I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on one of them.
these intros keep getting better!
Caveats for developers: the default installation path of Homebrew is NOT the same as the Intel one. I got screwed so hard this week. If your gcc compilation process depends on header files downloaded thru Homebrew, you are gonna have a bad time.
&quot;Like Linus&quot; - Marques Brownlee 2021
Great review. I have been waiting for 11 years on my current 2011 MBP for upgrade. Maybe time to upgrade!
OVERPRICED GARBAGE,as always from apple.
If they retained the ethernet port on the power brick, would you only be restricted to USB-C for power+internet? Or is the magsafe mag charger also capable having signal go through it? cause that&#39;d be pretty cool
TOP NOTCH Design.<br>exactly
Did he just say &quot;768gb RAM&quot; ???
Just one question. Does it heat up????
I&#39;m currently watching this on a Macbook Pro mid 2012, 1tb SSD, 8Gb ram
Got my M1 Pro for $800 on FB a month ago. No regrets.
The great reviews of this yt channel
how many days later 🤔🤔🤔<br>finally Review 😱😱





I&#39;m gonna miss the touch bar... Now I can&#39;t skip YouTube ads anymore... :(
It&#39;s a beast!!<br>Just remembered it&#39;s from Apple<br>Me: ohh it&#39;s a trash





What 768GB of RAM?!? That seems completely overkill even for video editing lol. I&#39;m curious what your max usage of that RAM is.





I&#39;ve never been an Apple user but this is heavily tempting




Totally agree about the Ethernet on the power and that it’s odd that the sd and hdmi are not high end. Not deal breakers , but odd

I love the Touch Bar…I don’t see why people complain about it…but to each their own




Wow! If they do even better next year, they&#39;ll score my heart back 😂
Wow <br>I was waiting for this review, next level.<br>Great tools for the job.





iu wish they sold one without the notch, no camera nothing.





Did you just found about C2C recently lol ? Cuz u&#39;ve been using them on ur intros and filming your examples with them :D

That notch looks so ugly...





I actually really liked the touch bar. My favorite part of it was that I could easily scrub forward in videos that had controls &quot;locked.&quot; Lecture videos lol




I wonder if they didn&#39;t add the Ethernet port on the charger because the magnetic cable cannot have the bandwidth to transfer data that fast — honestly I have no idea if I what I wrote makes any sense 😂




Top notch design 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣




Holy smokes @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m27s">16:27</a> &quot;The Mac Pro I&#39;ve edited on has 768GB of RAM&quot;

Marques, you using these laptops in a sawmill?





Hi, thank you for this review video! But I would like to ask your opinion. I´m an 3D artist and I do a lot of interior renders and I have a MacBook Pro 2016 and I´m planning to upgrade but this year MacBook Pro is pretty pricey. So I was thinking about last year M1 MacBook Pro. Would this be noticeable upgrade? :)<br><br>Kind regards!





Are you going to use the MBP with the 2 XDR displays for normal editing?





laptop built for reviews.




I feel like the explanation of the notch is pretty simple: They&#39;re waiting to incorporate FaceID in the next generation, but don&#39;t want to have to increase the size of the notch to do it. Sure, they don&#39;t need the 2021 notches to be as big as they are just to fit the camera. But I imagine people would be more irked if the 2021 notch was tiny, and then grew way bigger to implement FaceID in a year or two. They&#39;re planning ahead by getting everyone accustomed to a big notch, so that when they add FaceID, they&#39;re only giving you an &quot;improvement,&quot; rather than a tradeoff.


















we are geting into new era




I am groot





Honestly, your intros are marvelous




The adapters don&#39;t match the laptop color, because it&#39;s cheaper to have no color.<br><br>Color crystal would have to be added to the plastic mixture to give the color and with plastic, you may not get consistent results like you do with metal.<br><br>Metal is easier to colorize and get the same consistency. <br><br>Also color on metal is less likely to fade with time and with plastic it does.<br><br>Black or white are best for plastic, because well they aren&#39;t colors and they are cheaper to make.
Great intro music<br>You guys always deliver





Just WOW🤩
The performance on these new machines is amazing. 64GB of vram is higher than pretty much any GPU sold by Nvidia (gaming or not), very interested to see what AI training performance is like on the new macbooks. Unfortunately as a windows user I need access to bootcamp. I also dont feel comfortable dropping 4k on a laptop when a lot of my performance will be lost due to overhead on parallels. I&#39;m gonna stick with my Zephyrus G14 for now which gives me similar performance in a smaller form factor for 1/3 the price.<br><br>If microsoft and apple get windows 10 arm working on the M1 Max chip tho... i may have to drop some fat stax



I have never Seen The Best YouTuber in the World ever kiss some Gadget like that with so much satisfaction 😀👏🏻
Great and Detailed Review, Marques. I&#39;m looking forward to the Desktop IMac Pro, to see what upgrades it has and how it performs. 😊



What a tool. not you Marq, the Laptop


Haha a new &quot;Top Notch&quot; design, clever :-)










Better prep them socks bruv 🤣🤣


why do you say &quot; next level&quot; instead of game changer. sounds like to me, its a game changer. when you don&#39;t have carry a $50,000 imac computer that fits into a luggage because its so big


I want one after hearing all the praise you showered on how good it worked for you!  Great review inside and out!


We got Marques fully nerding out in video


The form-v-function pendulum swung way to far to minimalism ... we now exit the &#39;Ives era&#39; of  and move back to what users need in &quot;Pro&quot; level machines.


it blew my mind that the m1 max beat the $50,000 counterpart by a full sixty seconds despite being only 4% of the price.


I’m guessing they planned to have Face ID in these laptops but then because of supply chain shortages they had to just do a normal camera.


Your facial hair is on life support.


This guy would literally buy and eat iCondom if one made by Apple.


Apple care or not to Apple care? that’s the real question


This is a huge step forward for apple. Finally listening to some of the user&#39;s feedback. I am extremely annoyed that most of the things added (back) are not highest end (eg HDMI, SD). I am also outraged with the boxy body design. This seems too generic and simple for such an expensive machine. I do imagine only pros using it, but as a flagship macbook model, and a portable machine no less, it should have better design.<br>When you carry this in a back with 50 more things, suddenly a 1 cm difference can make some difference.<br><br>This macbook literally feels like an old chest: looks old and plain on the outside, but possible has treasure on the inside... and ugh some of the treasure is a bit outdated.


Mind-blowing intro !!!!! 🎉🎉


Wow wow wow


Drop all these additional products Apple! Next year: MacBook, MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max


These are incredible, am I the only one not liking the &quot;new&quot; design tho ?


D E T A I L E D


I feel I am lucky to trade in my MBP 16 2019 for this beautiful beast MBP M1 Pro 16 , 1TB. Everything about it is amazing love it!!! Paying monthly $100 for 1 year in return. IT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT 💕


ah yes, ONLY 768 gigs of RAM...


If only that notch didn&#39;t exist then this would have been the perfect laptop in every possible way.


Finally!! Been waiting for this 😃



The extra strong magnet on the magsafe isn&#39;t that great of a feature...you want it to disconnect easy...that&#39;s the whole point


I would be so happy if this Macbook can play all the games that I play so I can buy only one machine for hardcore productivity and gaming


The notch is sick and functional. Stfu people


Apple going backwards? No way, thats a new


Top notch design. The world sees what you did there. Ha ha.


It is a great laptop, but you forgot to mentioned how it feels like cheap plastic compared to last years models. Oh and shout out to Groot in the corner.


The dislikes are from Pelican employees who won&#39;t be selling as many cases anymore


Thoroughly enjoyed🙋


dudes like this guy are money maker for apple


Your expensive Mac Pro is all RAM.


Seems like Pixel 6 pro has become a daily driver for Marcus 😃


Its very clear that the future in processing architectures is going to be ARM and its custom implementations.<br>x86 is old, too branchy, too power consuming, and cannot be saved at this point.  <br>Just waiting for a decent competitor in the Windows world.


Can it play games?



what modernise look? it is a old mac pro design..


1. I wish I could afford a M1 MAX 2. I wish I did something that required that amount of power.


Great review, friend. This is the first review that included information that wasnt already in the Apple Event. The details about the ports was welcome and useful. Party on and continued success!


Are the edges still ridiculously sharp?


I really didn&#39;t need the extra power, but I wanted a bigger screen.  I went with the 14&quot; M1 MacBook Pro, but I really only needed the M1 MacBook Air... only with a bigger screen!




@mkbhd Most youtube reviewers talk about video rendering since thats what matters most to them. However a huge portion of people buying pro machines are developers and software engineers. Could you include some compiling benchmarks? Synthetic benchmarks don&#39;t do it justice


Sitting here with my MagSafe 2 Macbook the sizzle reel of the MagSafe is unimpressive


These are terrible laptops, no ethernet port was, is and always will be ridiculous for anyone looking to do real work.


„Top notch design“. Really like what you did there 🙂


768 gb of ram?!???!!?


Me encanta tus videos amigo! Eres increible 😀


A Truly Pro Intro!


I got the 16&#39; m1pro, and im noticing some blue blurring when the screen transitions from pure black to white, especially when you&#39;re swiping between two apps (one is dark and another is white) with your 3 fingers. i thought it was a defect so i bought another one, and it still has the same issue:( anyone here got this problem as well


Make sure to put out a poll for the different sock designs you could potentially wear when you have to wear them next year.


But like tbh, why the fck did they make the laptops thicker? The battery is not so much better, and the chips produce so much less heat, so whats the deal?


Finally! )))



Can I please get 1🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿


One guy I know in the administration of the university i attend is praying one day his mac will get repaired. Repaire anxiety prevent me to own a mac... I know my clumsy hand can lead to a mess real quick.


These machines are really amazing!


It feels like I’m the only one that enjoys the Touch Bar lol I’ll miss it


Watching a youtube video about Macbooks on a MAckbook while shopping for the new Macbook.... Jeez


I will not by a new MacBook until they make a new 12 inch


Great review and you hit all the right points. I cant wait to get my upgrade, though I shall miss having that touch strip as it grew on me. The 14 inch maxed out sounds very tempting but definitely worried about the thermals.



haha, holy crap.  You&#39;d rather lug around a giant case and bring a desktop computer with you in 2021 than learn a video editing tool that runs on a PC?<br>... other option would be to upload those videos from where you&#39;re traveling in 1080p and literally nobody would notice.<br>I understand 4k for movies, but not for commentary videos


who’s idea was it to put a notch on a laptop they needa be fired


any idea on where to get a case? or anything to protect it


Playing devils advocate, Would the touch bar work if it were above the trackpad?


Thunbs up for &quot;Top notch design&quot; pun and snerk!


I just feel like some of the negatives Marques said, sound more like an excuse rather than a critique of the device. <br><br>With all the outdated ports, he doesn&#39;t acknowledge that they are a negative, he makes it as though it is an additional feauture even though outdated just because Apple decided to put it back, when if compared to the competition we know it`s a downside, but when the competition does something like this, he demolishes them.<br><br>I feel like lately he is SUPER biased in favor of Apple, always making excuses as to why they&#39;re making worse stuff.


every time i watch an mkbhd review, it feels like im watching an apple commercial with those intros 🔥


Still gonna struggle with pdf&#39;s


which editor do u use marques


tbh the internal silicon is next level but the peripherals and io are preview level.


now if the jade 4c story is true, the mac pro will have basically 4 m1max socs glued together. this will be a basically unstoppable machine.


One less dongle.


“i’m on the next level”


I am groooot❤️


They probably can’t do Ethernet with the brick because it’s MagSafe now. Probably only works with usb-c


nothing impressive


Google Pixel 6 Pro in the video?


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=14m30s">14:30</a> ‘butt’ , shoulda zoomed in


Triple dongle…..sounds explicit 🤣🤣


Can you tell me the name of the intro song?


&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus&quot; 😂🤣😭



This line up is mad!


The HDMI is actually really nice. It&#39;s not just one less dongle - it&#39;s one less docking station, since USB-C / Thunderbolt don&#39;t natively output an HDMI signal. USB-C to HDMI cables with ICs kinda suck.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m11s">6:11</a>, thats because it was designed and manufactured last year. You just dont know it


Thank you for this! Great review as always, now I can order mine with no worries! 🙌🏾🙌🏾


another great video from you and your crew! thanks for breaking this down, after the touchbar mac (also sad it didn&#39;t realize it&#39;s full potential), and that awful keyboard, i&#39;m glad to see a return to form from apple.


What a bunch of sheeple. Look at that notch, what a joke. Overpriced junk.


Well balanced…very well balanced . You make us feel confident that you know what you’re talking about….Great Job . I must I have no need or funds at present 🎁 but you make me want to bite the 🍎


Lol the M1 pro is better than my 125w i7 10700k


I knew it.. anything with notch is fast but expensive at the same time 😶







































Now Apple needs to hold on to FaceID for a  couple more years so Marques has to wear socks and sandals for a day


It’s really great seeing Apple finally listening to its customer base


I&#39;m currently using the 2015 MacBook Pro....yeah I&#39;m jumping on that 16-inch son! 😁


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=19m19s">19:19</a> that tweet there is exactly what I have been trying to tell people who have been trashing these MacBooks for their very high prices. If a professional who earns money with this gets more shit done because of it, it is worth it. These aren&#39;t really consumer products, that&#39;s what the M1 is for. <br><br>I would love to see a bigger consumer MacBook. A 15&quot; MacBook Air with a normal M1 (or M2)? Just give me the better speakers and screen, that&#39;s all I want. lol. M1 is already all the performance I need on a laptop.








Absolutely support the idea of the ethernet on the power brick. this should be a standard wherever applicable


The notch is not the same situation as on iPhones. It&#39;s a laptop. You still got all that space to the left and right that is being utilized and it doesn&#39;t change the fact that 16/9 video is still 16/9


Adding ports but lower speed last gen ports... oh apple how hilarious you are.


Fucking notch. Seriously? Not a bug a feature. Give me a break


Top notch design - not just the one you can see :o


It&#39;s funny when Desktop 1 and Desktop 2 appear from the bottom of the notch when using mission control and I hate that, this damn notch is also on them PCs to the hell with it...


If the ethernet port is on power adapter, I will have to carry a heavy power adapter with me all the time if I need to use the ethernet port.



768 gigs of ram what the fuckk 😂


But can I play Minecraft on it?


Very nice review, also very nice text animation on the lid of the MBP. Do you think the ram upgrade, 64 instead of 32, is worth the price from a data manager/full hd video editing perspective?


how good does it browse pron ?


$AAPL📈


The only time the touchbar was useful was when there was a glitch where you could use it to skip ads on youtube
Hated Apple for a long time, but this is objectively the best laptop money can buy period. It feels though that Apple left some improvements like the HDMI 2.1, UFS 3.0, smaller notch, better DAC and iphone level front camera just so people will have a reason to buy the next one, because had they not, this looks like a laptop that you buy once and you don&#39;t need anything more for 5+ years. That&#39;s why they need to leave some stuff on the table for the next version.
This is such a good looking MacBook. For some reason, I just love the more blocky and square design compared to the rounded edges.


PLEASE Apple, release a nice display for it because there is not a single good 5k or 6k display on the market.
What I want you to get upset about is the lame lightning port introduced back on September 12, 2012 still being used on Apple products.  Apple needs to move to USB4 port in host mode all options on.  Even as a normal I am looking for 40Gbit/s data transfer rate.  So get over the notch.  You hate the notch, and I hate the punch hole.  Apple could have kept the forehead all the way across and then no &quot;Dreaded Notch&quot;.<br><br>At last a truly professional Apple MacBook Pro for you to use in your productions.  Yes go with the biggest baddest 16-inch MacBook Pro you can put your hands on.
Listen…He needs to stop making these banger intros 😂. Apple collab with Marques and make a short ad fr.
Why wouldn&#39;t Apple make the new Macbook Pro with a full 4K display. Don&#39;t most pro Macbook users make lots of video on their Macs.
Hey, how many external displays can You connect?
There&#39;s no way that the audio problem is due to the RAM, 64 gigs are plenty enough. Looks like a software problem to me
Watch Samsung come out with a holepunch laptop lol
When you hit like without even seeing it... lol
Why couldn&#39;t my 2011 MacBook pro just last one more year? I love my computer, but damn, I hear its fans all the time, and it&#39;s a 2020 16&quot; with the 8 core i9.
Finally😂 I kept coming to your page and refresh it everyday for the past week 😂
I am Groot
Thank god the physical keys are back along with the ports!
I’ve never heard MKBHD react with the words “Jesus” to anything and I have to agree using this thing is a joy and a half.








Wow Awesome Review
m1 max is hands down the best mac i have ever owned - late to the review party but boy your reviews are class apart.
Finally your review! Thanks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m09s">17:09</a> 3rd one is M1 Max mbp not M1 Pro Mbp....cheers...
finally you uploaded
Wait!!! It has a notch?
i’ve finally been able to consolidate all of my work to one portable device, that maintains battery all day. I have to run CAD, Signal analysis tools, EM field solvers(all X86-64) in Windows(via Parallels). And I can do this on battery, all day long. I have to be at a lot of places during the day and being able to just close the laptop lid in the middle of something, going to some other location, and then being able to jump right back in anytime, with the computer sitting in my lap(if I have to) without my legs melting off… it has added such convenience that I’m able to work much more efficiently. I used to have to use a giant fan pointed at my windows laptop to keep it from thermal throttling.

















why is soo mad when people are blacking off the notchw
Interested to see how these handle OBS and Ableton suite. Kinda regretting my maxed out Asus ZenBook Pro Duo now.



Very informative. Well done.
Rather than travel with an iMac, why not just use an ultrabook PC? They’re as small as a MacBook, yet more powerful than any iMac.


Srx a MSI creator with a rtx 2070 destroys a M1 by miles in 4k rendering. M1 needs 20-25 min while the Intel nvidea needs 6-8 min. And you did not provide the information in the M1 test. So you will lie about the M1 pro too. Sry can&#39;t trust you as your M1 review was wrong. Or let&#39;s call it incomplete to let apple shine. You are stuck with apple. Sorry to see that
I know people probably didn&#39;t notice and I think its a testament to how good mkdhd shots normally are that this stuck out so much. But that camera tracking in the beginning was so poorly done. It bothered me so much.
Apple will be always last tech companies to include emerging proven tech like touch screen, stylus support, high refresh rate, faster wifi, 5g, newer version of HDMI, SD, RAM, USB type-C support and so on. Their products are not user-friendly as well as exorbitantly expensive So big thumbs down to Apple.👎
Risk finally kills Cisc (sorta...)
It just blows my mind that they make &quot;pro&quot; devices this expensive and they still can&#39;t put a damn ten key on it. What the hell, apple.
The waveform delay you mentioned is something I actually think is more Final Cur 10.6 related. I&#39;ve experienced the same after doing the update. It didn&#39;t happen in any of the 10.5 versions.
Cool video marques keep it up 👍
Top Notch Design...nice.
I remember, it was 2008, I bought myself Playstation 3 (used, but hot staff this time). Problem was that I had just crt screen, and to play first time hd game, I had to visit my friend, whose parents bought sony bravia 32” hd TV. Since PS3 was a HEAVY peace of incredible technology 13 years ago, I used my ryanair size suitcase to carry this console from one apartment to another, being proud myself that there is someone in Poland, not using 55x40x25 case to smuggle cigs to UK, but to show magnificent games in crazy 1366x768. 😂 Do not laugh about this iMac case, since there is a purpouse to share new technology among certain people 🤗
Life choices... Buy an apple and be cool and trendy or buy a PC laptop that can do the same for 1000-1500 less and use that money to improve the world. There&#39;s a reason the logo of apple simbolizes the original sin ;) and i don&#39;t care if you tell me a similar PC can&#39;t do the same. They can and they are a lot more upgradable, repairable, and versatile. Although It&#39;s always funny to see apple trolling their fans with amazing features like ports or notches🤣
For me the m1 macs are disappointing. I work as a 3d artist. Apple compared the m1 to 3080 for rendering 3d scenes. I mainly use redshift as a renderer. The m1 max is pretty much demolished by the 3080 mobile for the redshift bench marks. While the GPU is definitely good for being integrated, it doesn&#39;t even compare to windows laptops at less than half the price that have 3080s. The cpu component of the m1 is great, but for 3d work the gpu is pretty much the most important thing now because the faster you can render in real time the better/faster you can work in 3d. If apple had not compared it to the 3080 I probably wouldn&#39;t have had such high expectations. Hopefully though we can see a better gpu or a imac with a m1 cpu and a nvidia gpu.


HAPPY*<b>DIWALI*</b> FROM INDIA 🌟✨🎇🎆🎇🪔🪔🪔🪔🎇🎆🧨🧨🙏🙏..


“So lets take a look at the top notch design” nice pun 🤣👌🏽


I&#39;m willing to bet the reason the notch is there, is because that is where you lift the screen. It&#39;s protection for the LED screen and if you have fingerprints there, it&#39;s not that big of a deal.


Laptop&#39;s great of course, but anyone else notice the serious flex that Obama follows MKBHD?


Do you see this apple? If he says you made something good, than it’s really good.


I&#39;m waiting for the 2022 Air comes out, as these Pro models are, unfortunately, too expensive for me!
Appreciate the time you took to edit this. Great intro!
• APPLE • ❤️❤️

&quot;Top Notch Design&quot; nice


My god love that 2021 animation thing on the lid. Best intro ever!!!


Lol. Looks like the competition is completely wrecked. I&#39;m going to have to go mac for my next laptop.


768GB of RAM, what did I just hear


I wonder when the other brands will get these chips from TSMC.


I AM GROOT 👍


Marques, would you ever put money in Shiba inu?


Socks and sandals for a day. If that day does happen, Linus should be there to enjoy it with you


Great video, as usual! But you talked solely as a tech reviewer and pro user, but most normal people don&#39;t swap a computer every year, so how about talking about it as a regular user, someone that buys a laptop/computer for the long run?  <br>BIGGEST question: is the new MacBook timeproof? if going &quot;all out&quot; on the 16&quot; mac, the $3,500 one, would it hold its power/worth against other computers in 5 years&#39; time?


At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m26s">16:26</a> dif he said 768gigs of RAM 😐?


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m01s">17:01</a>  the M1 Pro MacBook Pro outdoes itself in exporting...  how does that work??


&quot;One less dongle&quot; 👁️👄👁️ bruhhhh why does that sound coooooool!


So sad they can really play that many game :(


That into doe.... wow Marques, that was epic.


I hate it when people look at apple products and disingenuously call them &quot;forward-thinking&quot;, &quot;revolutionary&quot; or even when they try to claim that Apple has &quot;invented&quot; absolutely ANYTHING new in the past 10 years. Every product, every design tweak in their devices? It&#39;s been done already, and likely for over a year. They were not the ones to &quot;implement the notch design&quot;, they don&#39;t ever invent anything. All they do is take existing tech and make it pretty and appealing to hipsters and people with too much money. By all means, I guess, give your money to apple. But quit pretending the company actually does anything worth paying attention to beyond &quot;huh, that&#39;s sort of neat, I guess&quot;. (not like I think anyone&#39;s gonna slow down on the apple videos or fanboy-ing, I just urge that maybe you should try being real with yourself)
&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus&quot; 🤣
👍🏾 for the intro.
Most awaited Video from MKBHD
Now that your travel iMac is retired, can i have it bruh

This feels like plastic.  The computer is great but the look when the laptop is closed doesn&#39;t meet Apple&#39;s standards.
I am GrooOooOO00oot

If Marques says he feels good about the product then I feel confident too.
One more thing - placing the ethernet connect through a &#39;proxy&#39; device like a powerbrick is an issue. Ethernet and electric current are fighters, not lovers, so I can see the combo of that problem, mixed without a direct line in to ethernet would be more a detriment than a help.  The &#39;minimalism&#39; they aspire to on these machines are &#39;design over function&#39; and the original design to have these additional ports on this or the MacMini are appropriate, regardless of any OCD designer. Design can move osmething beautiful to stpuid. Saving the side of the machines of clutter is stupid.

Thanks for the review and nice video!<br><br>Only one small suggestion, since you guys like to cover all small details in the videos, avoid looking up from time to time. Maybe you are reading the script or something, but it seems strange... :D
It’s been a year that I started using these new chips, so
It looks like they finally saw Casey neistat&#39;s video


People hated the moth on the iPhone. What did they do? Added it to the MacBook too... Smh
If someone is willing to give me one I accept, thank you


Man, Jhonny Ive left for GOOD!


Do the keys rub on the screen when the lid is closed?
If the day comes when we can play AAA games on it, plugging an eGPU on it, I&#39;ll do the transition without a doubt


the review we’ve been waiting for!!!
Next level for me is adding a touch screen and having all ports besides some
Apple is business laptop and gaming laptop is gaming laptop. 😅
Was waiting on this one. Love your reviews!
I wish I had the money y’all do to get these things.
Awesome bhai, <br>Best review
So people are comparing Arm softwares arm OS with Arm cpu to x86, if you want to do fair comparing them get other arm cpu and software for it,but wait windows doesn&#39;t support nor there are other arm cpus,why would they none support them..so people comparing arm with x86 is joke itself..mobile software vs x86
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m04s">17:04</a> that’s double Pro


Everyone: &quot;That&#39;s a nice MacBook&quot;<br>Me: &quot;Someone is about to celebrate 15m subs&quot;
I can&#39;t wait till 2 years time when this becomes the standard specs for Macbooks and I can afford it without putting my future in jeopardy.


top notch design 😂✌️
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> &quot;Top notch design&quot; hehe :)
now, we need sth similar from Riscv of intel,even dual chip design on one with both x86&amp;arm Riscv embedded on those...having the best of both worlds. and with windows getting better to run on big.little &amp;Arm architectures, we will be getting some competition to jump to next level on the other side of fence as well
I love Marques because he truly isn&#39;t a fanboy. When he gave the full read on those ports, I was like, &quot;Yes.&quot; Most reviewers wouldn&#39;t either A) notice that, or B) realize it was relevant to point out. That being said, I&#39;m super excited for these laptops and I&#39;m glad they&#39;re out!!!
Bought the 14in Pro Max and OMG this thing is amazing!!!

Marques, thanks for the great review.
Nobody makes UHS-III cards or readers yet! I keep seeing people complain about this and I&#39;ve searched online. I can&#39;t find a single store selling either UHS-III cards or UHS-III readers. So maybe the spec has been released, but the actual products don&#39;t seem to exist.
That 2% drop in battery while exporting… what the heck
That brick charger how good is it when you plug it into a wall? Looks heavy AF and prone to it falling off from the wall port.


Hey, in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m04s">17:04</a> its M1 Max MBP:4:06, small mistake😁


Would you recommend the 14 inch model to someone who just got into college and wants to game every now and then

786GB of RAM… what’s that like?

Yes, Top-Notch


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a> Top “notch” design, I Got it 😏
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been this excited about a computer. Where is the ceiling going to go from here???!
Thank you for takin yo tyme with this.😗


I can only dream 😅
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=19m13s">19:13</a> this is a really important point. Yes these are expensive machines, but for pros you basically get than money back in productivity. It&#39;s an investment!








What&#39;s interesting is that none of the youtube reviewers (Linus, Marques, others) seem to have tested the notch themselves – all reviews made exactly the same mistake saying that menu content goes under the notch. This is incorrect! You all seem to base your conclusion on that viral video from Twitter (Marques even shows it in a video) that used 3rd party software to render the menu bar. It&#39;s not the default behavior! If the menu overflows from the left it actually skips the notch space and goes to the other side, there are tons of UI tweaks in the latest macos that interact with the notch properly and it&#39;s a shame that no one points it out.


Am I going nuts or did he say 768GB of RAM
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a> &quot;top notch design&quot; MKBHD puns are undefeated
I bet this thing absolutely slays solitaire
Great hardware, poor software :( I wish there was similar performing Windows laptop.



Yup... Gotta get one of these.
i think the filming are pretty… not good, compared to those previous videos. I know that you have a whole set of high tech filming set and a big filming team. I really love the content but this is the problem you should have a quick look through.
The Final Cut waveform redraw issue isn&#39;t a MacBook issue... it&#39;s a FCP 10.6 update issue. It&#39;s a bug.
Finally! Everybody was waiting for your review! 😉
your eyes are going up once and then. lol
&quot;Top Notch Design&quot;
Intel : well we had good run

congrats on the Laptop !
I may be reading too far into this video. But I think he likes them...
Let’s be honest. If this were to be released by any other company other than Apple, MAC users will be laughing their asses off. As I write this from my iPad mini 6.🤨😒
You gotta have the right tools for the job, Beavis.
Price as shown?
768 gigs?!
I love how apple can remove ports - bring them back with subpar technology and charge an ungodly amount of $ for it and still be praised. They really know how to work it. &quot;You should be thankful we even brought these ports back - we didn&#39;t have to!!&quot;





that intro was dope
SD Card slot. Yay, youtube content creators and photographers rejoice! Everyone else, couldn&#39;t care less.
Where is the Touch bar?
ah hell nah theyre putting notches on laptops now??


Thanks, Tech god.
I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎
Great Video. I am tempted to buy one.
Allrigh, let&#39;s say that Im not a video or image editor, but I need a powerfull machine to handle heavy excel files. This product is really next level in this case?
Mind boggling 🤯🤯🤯
Why hdmi 2.0 not 2.1 and slow SD speed? Well I guess those will be key features of the next macbook pro
They still support high refreshrate on one of the thunderbolt ports right? HDMI is fine for meetings for beamers etc..
Is it possible to use the M1 Imac powerbrick with ethernet on this M1 Max Macbook Pro?


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m28s">6:28</a> whaat 😧


one less dongle


Anyone else getting Welcome To The Jungle vibes from the intro music?
Great review as always but Jesus I can’t believe you lugged an iMac around.


Finally! The only review that matters has been released! Love it! (Also once again, unreal intro shots, dude!)
The sound for the pop up graphics in this video sound like my AirPods are dying, and it freaks me out whenever something pops up


dramatically good -mkbhd
I love how you plugged a bunch of other youtuber&#39;s videos on the laptops from different perspectives.


Had an order for a 14&quot; MBP / M1 Max / 32GB of RAM / 1TB SSD and cancelled in favor of the 16&quot;. While I think the 14&quot; would be awesome I don&#39;t travel nearly as much as I used to and the 16&quot; seems like an absolute beast. My thought is if you&#39;re going with the M1 Max for performance you might as well go with the form factor that will provide as much thermal capacity as possible. The bigger screen doesn&#39;t hurt either...


All I want is like a 16inch MacBook Air 😂
Honestly, I have never been this eager to see your video before 😅


Been checking the status of my order in the Apple store app like 10 times a day! All I get is “We have everything necessary to complete your order. We&#39;ll update your delivery date<br>when your order is preparing to ship.” November 26th can’t come fast enough. Think I’ve watched every single video on the new MCPs…even the ones in languages I don’t understand!! 😂🤣


I love how naturally he says &quot;HAS 768 gigs of RAM&quot;.
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽



Its finally here... I was waiting so long for this.. was wondering if MKBHD stopped reviewing units that comes with an embargo.


on one hand I like the ports, but on the other hand, it feels like it just defeats the dream of one port to rule them all


Ok 👍 top notch design. I’ll give you that


i was eating while watching this and i almost spat all over the keyboard when he said the socks and sandals thing, poor Linus


"Well explained.
<br>Congrats"
I remember when Asus introduce their phones with notch, they don&#39;t have think bezels. They put the notch for the sake of having a notch. So I would not be surprised when later on I will find some laptops with big bezels plus a notch as extra.


finally Apple learned a thing from LG<br><br>headphone jack for high impedance headphone is actually useful


Would&#39;ve immediately preordered if they brought back the ethernet port too

I am still perfectly happy with my 2019 16” MBP, especially since most of my work doesn’t require that level of processing power. This gives me time to allow Apple to refine the design of the new 16” a bit. If your workflow requires this level of processing power, you can’t go wrong with with one of these. Way to go, Apple!!!
How many (But) in the video? 😂


The higher refresh rate is good for… moving your mouse around a lot? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m38s">9:38</a><br><br>Yeah, at a few thousand dollars, these machines aren’t for me lol

top notch design 😂😂
Literally nothing here seems next level


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> I see what you did there XD


As a upcoming engineer I wish this can run solidworks and other cad softwares 😭😭😭
i guess there is just no io bandwith left for hdmi 2.1 or ethernet :D hdmi 2.0 is 14,4gbit/s while 2.1 is 43 Gbit/s. 40 gigabit for a video output, they would have to get rid of one of the tb4 ports for sure, and those are more versatile. ethernet would be at least 1 gbit on top, but more like 2,5 or 10gbit in the macbook pro. in the old macbook pro, the tb ports on the same side shared their bandwith, but those 3 are all individually connected with the full bandwith.
Pretty good? Biased much. You were so close when you said, &quot;you&#39;d expect the highest end tech on such an expensive laptop...&quot; why can&#39;t you say how it is like it is. They cheaped out on us yet charging a ton for their laptop as always.

Good review 👍
Waiting for mine in the mail 🥺 nice video!


Nah. I’ll keep my old pro.
The best laptop on the market, without a doubt.
Good review, kinda boring though. Your competition did just as good and better and released sooner with more energy.😬
Something tells me that Apple&#39;s gonna realise they did a pretty great job with the M1 chips, and the upcoming generational improvements are going to be lackluster.


Apple is the Best of the Best💙❤
He has 768gb of ram? LOL


I really like it when youtubers only know about video editing and that’s all they can say regarding the performance. This guy has no clue about laptop performance. Let’s train a CNN and see how fast it does it.


Sorry but don’t talk about them adding back the jacks. That should be a class action lawsuit.


but you could film your content in regular HD 1080p30 and use an older mbp to edit it instead of a bulky imac.<br><br> I&#39;m on a mobile data plan and gonna be watching it in 144p anyway, so i wouldn&#39;t notice. why bother with 4k60fps? i wonder how common this use case is
I feel like the notch being that size has something to do with proportions. Maybe some sort of uniform design with the new iPhone 13&#39;s


Next level ? Or back level ?
I think you forgot to check the gaming performance, you focused only on editing performance of laptop which is fine but gaming is also a good way to judge the performance of any such hardware.
My wired Kef M500 cans sound great on my new 14&quot; unit, by the way.
Can the HDMI output 3008x1692 scaled resolution?? I ask because the Mac mini does not and it’s terrible
just commenting on ports and what Marques said, people are paying $$$$ for Macbook that have &quot;nah, not bad&quot; ports
I don&#39;t think they can provide ethernet on a power brick cause it&#39;s mag safe, not type-c USB port
Why isn’t it 4K? Why did Apple choose its own technology instead of just going with OLED?
*any new apple product gets released <br> mkbhd : starts having orgasm .
Wow these are really good! Now let&#39;s watch as more than 50% of people whom are buying these laptop just to watch YouTube /Netflix and scrolling Twitter only....
I feel your videos are more biased towards Mac books / Apple products
awesome M1

any thing on gaming no then lets move along.
The fact that they added back the ports just gave all those outdated ports a 5 year lease on life. There should be laws that make everyone use the same type of connector...would be the most environmentally friendly thing to do.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m10s">17:10</a> I would loooove to see the time of the base model M1 Mac Mini for this.
Spoiler ALERT + tl;dr, It&#39;s Alien Tech! 😁
It must be awesome just being able to casually use all the latest and greatest tech all the time. I&#39;m a little jealous but absolute props to Marques because he&#39;s gotten himself to this point through his own hard work. Much respect.
The touch bar really needed haptics


At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=10m41s">10:41</a>, I thought you were going to say “it’s really easy to complain about this… when you’re petty.” Lol<br><br>Which honestly, yeah, it’s really petty to complain about something like that.


I love the baby groot in the back it actually make a bit content
It will have to be long white tennis socks with two grey stripes, and khaki sandals with big ass soles please.
Love how there was a subtle pun &quot; top notch design&quot;😂😂😂.....loved this machine ❤️😍
Can you still charge it from one of the usb c connectors?
“A new top notch design” I see what you did there 😂


Using the Pixel 6 Pro in an Apple product review… nice. 😀
I bet you money they’ll sell a brick with Ethernet separately. I don’t think everyone will need it so it makes sense.
I feel like you need to carry a blanket too, my dude. Sooo many people do the socks and sandals on the daily but since we know how cool it is in northern Jersey now you gotta go full Linus with the blanky.
next level unbeatable
768gb of ram that is bigger than my ssd
”M1 Max” and ”M1 Macs”
Here&#39;s a mistake at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m57s">16:57</a><br>It should be &quot;M1 Max MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>&quot;
Yay! You said &quot;That&#39;s been it&quot; ! xD 😆❤ Great review, as always, Marques. Thanks for spending the extra time on this.
I&#39;ve been waiting years for this upgrade. From the 2012 retina display ... Was overjoyed to see this announced and had my order in within the hour

It would be counter intuitive to add ethernet to the power brick when they expect most users to use Magsafe anyway.<br>I think it would confuse more people than it would help honestly
When I got the iPhone 12 Pro I realized I probably wouldn’t need to get a new phone for a long time.  The new MacBook Pro Max is kind of like that for laptops IMO
I have so many icons across my menu bar that I think the notch will probably get in the way.
Petition for Marques to make official Apple intros
This would be such a great desktop replacement for me. Other than the 75% of the time I spend on windows on programs. Honestly is painful to not be able to use M1 chips as it would be so nice for my photo editing but all of my cad work is windows only so would be a massive waste to get this only for Adobe.
Is the autocue above the camera? Keep seeing you glance up at whatever is there
Top notch 😂😂👌🏽


Socks &amp; Sandals Like Linus 😂💀


I just hate how the battery life decreased dramatically

A new “top notch” design.<br><i>nice</i>


The notch still bugs me


Can I get a refund on my dongles? 😂🙄
You have 768 gb RAM in your Desktop PC? Woah
Was in the market for a new laptop that I could edit photo and video on, coming from one that couldn&#39;t, and had a hard choice between the 14&quot; MBP and the Razer Blade 14. I went with the Razer Blade just because I do like to game and would like to game when I am travelling. But yeah as a person who has never owned a Mac I was strongly considering these devices and maybe in the future when I am looking to upgrade again I might go with the MBP, they seem like great devices.
Thanks for this review, it will come in handy.
Top-notch design 😭


TOP NOTCH!!! BWA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  that was funny!


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a> text mistake mentions pro instead of Max


I won’t buy an M1 Mac until VMWare makes a virtual machine set up for M1 Macs so I can run the old school windows apps for data analysis.
And then you will get a red camera that can record 16k and you will be back carrying a suitcase full of mac pros


flying with an iMac is actually PEAK MKBHD


Why source a clip from SnazzyLabs but omit where it came from? Literally cut the guy&#39;s head there in your clip, not cool.
Great review, as always! P.S. We’re constantly working on M1 upgrades and are almost done 😮💨
Finally!
Bro please give your old rog  phone ☺️☺️
“A new top-notch design” 😂


Just imagine what Steve Jobs would think of this if he was here with us today.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m52s">3:52</a> I think marques forgot to colour grade this segment of this video😅


Top Notch Design.... I see what you did there


hehehe. Linus?


Non-professional photographer here pining over a maxed out system. It would take a long time for me to get my money back in “saved time” with the amount of photos that i am editing, but it sure would make the task a lot less arduous and daunting. Time to budget for a 14”!
Dankpods lesson


Mkbhd - Thanks for watching<br>Us - Thanks for uploading<br>Apple - Thanks for supporting


Waiting for your cover since very first review video released by others!!. You have the Magic. Magical MKBHD Take


Agree that the display and the speakers (16&quot;) are absolutely incredible. I wish I had more use for it, to justify keeping it, but I don&#39;t 🥲


Ethernet on a laptop brick wont work as well, because 1) this MagSafe is made to detach easily unlike the iMac power connect and you don’t want to accidentally disconnect while uploading a file etc and 2) Laptops are more likely to be picked up and moved around so same, easy to forget and suddenly lose your connection.


Rich college kids are like, ok, I need to buy MacBook Pro for Netflix


That intro was 👌


This is the ugliest thing I&#39;ve ever seen


OMG, it would be hilarious to see you wearing socks and sandals hahahah


Paying that much for a laptop is a crime, but a laptop with that ugly notch? Lol. And the fact that you (the reviewer) applauded USB C and now APPLAUDING that they brought back the regular jacks is a joke.


I travel with my iMac frequently to do on-the-road edits! So glad to hear a laptop can finally do the task!  🙌🏽
I can’t describe how much of a pain in the ass that looks to have to get on a plane with an iMac.
Review the Mavic 3!!!<br>Its amazing
Best MacBook Pro review on the internet period


Everytime, Marques. Steps. It. Up.


Hey 👋 nice review as always 🙌 I think there is a mistake at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m57s">16:57</a>. The textfield on the right shows “M1 Pro MBP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>” instead of M1 Max.
Meanwhile battery in windows - play a video of mkbhd, boom there you go fully charged to about 10 percentage. Man is Apple doing it great..!


that performance is double my laptop which has a 6 core i5 10500h
Those export times are nuts.


Really like your Android in the background
Fun fact. in Sweden, the base model of mac 14 pro is 2800 dollar!
Impressive. And I don&#39;t mean the computer. You know your craft.
if you are a one-charger-person, you cant charge your ipad, macbook, iphone and airpods with the same cable. Apple please explain?
I heard the GPU graph was over exaggerated compared to a mobile 3080 with high wattage in games


can&#39;t wait to replace my macbook pro 2015 with this one.
intel is next level behind


Your cam shots are better than Apple&#39;s
I don’t like it
In the chip comparison you have it written M1 Pro actually M1 Max
How much did you pay for your 28-Core Mac Pro with the Afterburner card?
I&#39;ve been complaining that my HDMI cord has changed not knowing that it was a later specification all this time😂 but still can&#39;t use it though cause I don&#39;t have a cord that fits it&#39;s type😪
I used to take my late 2013 iMac 27inch everywhere. Mind you the screen is now cracked to shyt. 😩 M1 PRO HERE I COME!


Me actually thinking there was a fly on the back of the mac 🥲😩
Dangit! Now I want one!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=15m01s">15:01</a> - totally speechless


what an intro
Video in short: I do production work while lying on sofa with Apple laptop, is faster than the guy working with the Desktop sweating trying his best


Who carry iMac while traveling ??




Wait wait wait…so you said the M1 Max “only” has 64GB of ram while the Mac Pro has 768GB of ram?? Sweet Jesus. I used to be able to tell what people meant by “memory” depending on what metric followed that name, since ram and SSD space can both be referred to as memory, but 768GB is blurring that line


Did MKBHD just casually drop that his Mac Pro has “768 gbs of ram”?! 😳


We fixed our broken keyboard and gave you your ports back (the 2018 ports).  Next level.
&quot;Top notch design&quot;  <br>Nice.


It looks like hp pro book or something. Previous design was much more better tbh


I think they probably had two Thunderbolt ports-worth of IO on the right hand side and split the second one between the SD card and the HDMI 2.0 - the throughput <b>kinda</b> adds up.


At least it was up until the new Intel chip came out, now Apple is the laughing stock.



Disclaimer: Character/Devices shown in this film is only for commercial purposes.

768 gigs of RAM?...sheesh. /s


That is disgusting, not you the laptop it’s way too thick nasty nasty


Oh man, I need a Max in a MacMini. I don&#39;t travel and I have a three screen set up at my desk. This would be perfect.
You really just called out Linus like that 🤣


This is a microsoft surface book with mac OS. Seriously the old design was better.


Apple thinks professionals are influencers so these laptops are optimized for that. Is there review for other professionals? Can I actually build my Unreal Engine projects on these things? Can it handle multiple Intellij build projects that are the size of actual professionals from Google or even Apple? I love my macbook pros, but every time they announce how great their laptops performs for &quot;professionals&quot;, they just mean importing and editing photos and videos for vloggers/streamers/influencers. There&#39;s almost no metric about how it actually performs in the hands of professionals. And having worked with macbooks my entire professional career, it has always been disappointing. I hope these laptops are better, but honestly, with no data again, it&#39;s impossible to tell.


Is there a mistake at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m11s">17:11</a>? I don’t unterstand why there’s two times MBP M1

Socks and Sandals, that&#39;s almost maximum comfort!


Me: Open Apple website in a new tab after watching this review.


2027 model ? How bro?


Marques, you are my inspiration.

Hi<br>I`m from Iran <br>Can anyone buy me a Mackbook Max 16 inc please!?


Kind of disappoint in general with the &quot;script&quot; of this video. I felt like 50-70% of the words said inthis video were redundant or just filling the air.


I&#39;m glad you no longer have to cart that other Mac around anymore. this will make traveling so much nicer for you 😊

When he doesnt mention pricing in the review you know it&#39;s not for us poors 😭


Doesn&#39;t really matter if the menu bar turns black to hide the notch when going full screen. The point is, you&#39;re NEVER going full screen because of the stupid notch.


U cant have a ethernet  on Mbook, because you disconnect when it reaches 80 or 100% instead of iMac which is powered from the mains

Yoooo that Calling Crows mix in the intro


beats fit pro vid comparing them to airpod pro?

Marques travelling with imac to render in 8k<br>Le people watching the video in 360p


Rip Intel lol. <br>I usually hate on Apple products but this is a great great improvement. So..<br>FU Apple.. but nice.!!


Finally❤️❤️
No more lit apple logo tho☹️☹️☹️
Lol my buddy is a photographer/videographer, I thought hes the only one carrying imac around.


Sheeeesh that intro was satisfying 🤤


Absolutely worth the wait ❤

Dude, you continue to crush it with excellent videos!

Awesome but unfortunately for people like me, we’ll never be able to afford it

Was desperately waiting for it ❤️

Hey Marques, just want to know one thing, the MacBooks support high-speed wifi, then why is everyone worried about ethernet?


Top notch video


Would the Ethernet brick work on the pro?


Intro better than an apple comercial

Honestly this Mac is like someone who is a 10/10 but has a huge mole on their nose 👃 you can look past it, but you always know it’s there…

im excited

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m31s">2:31</a><br>You actually walked back🤣


SHEEEEESH

HOLT SCHMOLY!!!!!!

Dave2D tested the laptop other brand laptop and the graph not exactly correct but still amazing though

THANK GODDDD they brought back some basic ports because trying to find adapters was getting old quick!! I&#39;m extremely happy to see a real HDMI port and SD card slot.

The mac is back


As expected, amazing review man! Well done.

Don&#39;t be happy, Apple will splash toxid software update  on Macbook M1 Max to make it slower than MacPro 2020 soon for the sake of 💰 money!


Took time but finally we got your review bro

Now I can change my 2015 macbook pro happily! :D

“FINALLY!!! The ports have come back to Maaaacbook Prooooo” The Rock


Typo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a>, the second &quot;M1 Pro MBP&quot; sounds like should say &quot;M1 Max MBP&quot;.


&quot;... three minutes and 49 seconds, Jesus&quot;<br>What does Jesus have to do with this?


&quot;Jesus!&quot;<br><br>Haven&#39;t heard that from him before.


Crazy performance!!!

Top notch design. Still not over that one.


<b>pokes microsoft and windows laptop/cpu manfacturers</b><br>uhmm hey i&#39;m broke, wanna... wanna do something that uuh beats this? please?<br>i also want a pen on my laptops for drawing notes etc.

For those wondering the intro instrumental is « Calling Crows » by Alltta.

&quot;top notch design&quot; kek

Perhaps, just possibly, Is this a pre-test to put the notch on iPads on the landscape side?!? 👀 is apple secretly testing the market for a design change? 👀

Mistake on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a>. Says M1 Pro MBP instead of M1 Max MBP
Great machine but the mbp m1 still rocks

చాలా బాగుంది సోదరా.<br>బాగా వివరించారు మీరు.<br>మీకు నా అభినందనలు.<br>శుభం భూయాత్.
I have the base $2k MBP and it’s incredible how powerful it is for photo editing and video editing for that price.

Everybody is just excusing the notch and apple... people even say it is super cool. The reality is: it is the the most ugliest and the most stupidest solution for a web cam ever made.<br>I would instantly fire the designer that come up with this idea and the stupid manager ho approved this non sense. I am pretty sure that if I would be working on this laptop, the notch would irritate me so much, that I would just throw this idiocy out of the window...<br>I would never ever buy this ugly laptop... it could be the most powerful computer ever, the notch can not be excused...

the things you’re describing here are actually in the realms of science fiction.


&quot;Top Notch design&quot; - MKBHD 😂😂😂


What&#39;s the name of the introductory font ..... Very beautiful
come on brother how&#39;s impressed is it for those doesn&#39;t have money like us 😥..<br>why every changes just a little big but the prize increases a lot🤨!!

MKBHD<br>What is your highest education qualification? Did you pursue Engineering?

Is it for gaming?


I&#39;m finally upgrading from at 2018 iMac to this I&#39;m so exec to see the difference


Like that shirt


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m07s">17:07</a> you wrote m1 MBP twice so yeah. <br><br>Just wanted to point that out


Why is there a notch on top of the laptop this looks way too hilarious🤣😁😁


9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.” 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”


&quot;only has 64 gb of rams&quot; bruh I didn&#39;t know that was the standard these days 😂



🎵 NO DONGLE, NO DONGLE🎵


That Groot plant is so admirable ☺️☺️☺️


First time I&#39;ve legitimately considered a Mac.


&quot;Top Notch design&quot;<br><br>I see what you did there.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m24s">12:24</a> I hope you’re not kidding! 😂


I hope this is a continuing trend of improving these &quot;PRO&quot; line of products for actual pros. The style over substance mindset Apple has had of late is really disappointing.

Apple, please put HDMI 2.1 in the M2, PLEASE. There are people who need this, they&#39;re the minority, but they exist.

That has got to be the sexiest intro yet

&#39;Top-notch&#39; review!

&quot;A new top notch design&quot;<br><br>I see what you did there


So Marques is using Pixel 6 pro huh?


INRTO SOUNDTRACK PLS SOMEONE


The performance in these are awesome!!

The thing I like about MKBHD videos is that all the products reviewed I can&#39;t afford 😁


I thought he would never release this video


I feel like Apple creators watch your videos and start throwing up and crying every time you have a small critique


So, you could use the high power mode all the time while connected, but automatic while on battery and it would still be pretty fast anyway because of how it works.<br>That&#39;s amazing.

Made in china = worthless


Is there anyone who shouldn&#39;t get one? 🤔

Maybe you can sell your Mac Pro now and power your displays using the MacBook Pro

Freaking awesome!

I used to drag my 2007 iMac to school for projects and work. Glad to see I wasn&#39;t the only one who looked insane lugging it around. <br>Got a maxed out 14&quot; max and have been nothing but impressed with it so far. This has been the portable studio I needed for a while and has replaced my maxed out 2013 MBP 15&quot;. Super impressed with the lack of heat, refresh rate, general speed and  portability.<br>The top notch only really impacted Civilization 5 when I tested it out,
Cant believe that your audio is not syncing with lips.🥲🥲


&quot;Only 64 gigs of ram &quot;<br>Hits very hard🥲


This review is next level. Nice work!

That &quot;2021 macbook pro&quot; overlay at the beginning of the video is pretty awful and doesn&#39;t seem like something you would do...<br><br>BTW Finally we do have time stamps, love that


Can&#39;t wait for them to upgrade the ports next year and it be &quot;revolutionary&quot;

I wish you would review these for what non-audio/video editors will use it for because 95% of Mac users don’t do that, but then again, apple is single-handedly killing its consumer market. When you’re a company whose pro desktop has wheels that cost as much as four tires on a Corolla, there’s something wrong.

can finally upgrade my 2015 macbook

I’m a professional who works on my computer all day…<br><br>An IT professional.  Help me justify how this will make Remote Desktop work faster, cause I really want one :(

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m50s">3:50</a> what happened to color?
Honestly, I have no use for the higher end Macs. I&#39;m perfectly content with my M1 Air as a writer.<br><br>But it&#39;s safe to say that Apple made the right decision by transitioning to their own silicon. The performance (and battery life, for long writing sessions) is insane. <br><br>(Even better, while on low-to-medium graphics, my wife can play Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 on her M1 Air with minimal thermal gains, and if you&#39;ve ever seen or know anything about that game, that&#39;s pretty crazy)

yep ...                                                                                                                                                ███████████
Tim: Hey guys, we need a marketing strategy for the next 10 years of MacBook releases<br><br>Some evil genius: how about we first remove ports and everything and make it shittier, and then make all that stuff come back retro style, people are gonna love it and even thank us!<br><br>Freakin&#39; Apple, man... geniuses

With the new apple silicons more than raw performance it&#39;s all about optimization, that&#39;s the real deal, and of course when you have total control over the hardware and software it&#39;s 100% sure that the results gonna be &quot;the best in class&quot;.
&lt;3
now a days your videos are too long and it&#39;s boring also ...
I need to upgrade from a 2012 15” macbook pro. I loved that computer. My son installed a 1 TB SSD because I have almost 10 years of family photos and videos. I plan to organize and edit the pics and videos. Since my 15” has no battery life anymore, I’ve been using a 2015 Macbook Air or an ipad when not at my desk. That MB Air has a horrible screen and very little storage (it’s an old family laptop that no one uses any more). I need a new laptop. While I know I should probably get the new M1 Air I’m drawn to the 14” Macbook Pro, with it’s larger, better and brighter screen, more ports and easier connectibility to a separate monitor in the event i want to connect it to a larger monitor or to a large screen tv to show videos. Does this make sense? If it wasn’t for the $1000 difference it would be a no brainer for me. I also prefer the most updated technology since I keep my computers until they die. The 16” is too expensive and too heavy for me. Thoughts?
I will probably never use the magsafe connector, but I&#39;m glad it is back. I&#39;m too much into the single cable life.
I am groot
How much did apple pay him lol, so many biased Apple videos and tweets past few months.
What????? 768 GB of RAM????
How much money are you going to save over the course of the next 12 months on luggage costs now that you don’t have to lug around that gigantic pelican iMac case?
Anybody spot the groot action figure in the pot on his left?😆😆
Maybe they&#39;re preparing for &quot;yo, for the next-gen macbook pro we&#39;ve reduced the notch by 50%!&quot;
MKBHD went full circle. from saying he doesn&#39;t need a desktop and a laptop is good enough, to going so desktop he travels with one, back to laptop in 2021
I have the 14 inch Pro and I mostly love it. However, my battery life went from 100% to 65% in an hour just using FaceTime and it got very hot. For all my other tasks it’s excellent though.
That is one fugly looking machine
How well does Blender or Autodesk Fusion 360 run on the M1 Pro or Max?
Best thing about this video and laptop&quot;&quot;&quot;One less dongle&quot;&quot;&quot;😂😂😂
Traveling iMac, wooooow, why not use a PC up until now... :D
That Nelson desk is beautiful. Love seeing it in your videos.
Looks impressive. I want it, but luckily I also realize that I don&#39;t really need it.
Nice review. I want a touch screen. Isn&#39;t Apple behind in this area? With this powerful a machine, it would be great for creatives to flip the lid and use the pencil on this MacBook.
Can anyone tell me the name of the INTRO SONG? PLS! I can&#39;t seem to find it on 20syl webpage.
Is just me or are these names confusing 🙃
Does anyone know the intro song
Man the 60W power brick does charge an IPhone fast.. imagine what this 140W brick will do... either will charge super fast or explode an IPhone.. either way can&#39;t wait to get mine...
All the high end ports will be in the next version of Mac Pro 🤪
But how much storage should we buy for the new Macbook Pro? 1 TB, 2, or 4?
I have a theory on the notch. They wanted to wait with Face ID so they have something for next year, but it would be hard for them to make the notch bigger marketingwise. So they made the notch big enough now to fit Face ID in the future
4 minute export time!! Rocket League doesn&#39;t boot up that fast! WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!


For marquees perfectionism <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> it should be “M1 Max MBP” ;)
RIP Final Cut. It&#39;s over. No one uses it anymore.


768GB of rams. Fuh.
I&#39;m just waiting for a windows laptop to compete with the MacBook Pro in performance and build. <br><br>I&#39;ve been waiting for a while.... 😥
16&quot; M1 Pro with 32GB ram for me. I&#39;m a developer.
Him saying such nice things about an apple product which have always fallen short of his high expectations makes me want to upgrade right away. It’s usually Justine who is giddy about apple products and I was like have they swapped out souls? But as he went into the details the machines sounded more factually brilliant than just flowery fangurling….
Love your honest authentic review. I had similar feelings about these MacBooks! Keep it up :D
Great work on the intro, I know a ton of effort goes into them!
You know its good when Marques plays Altta lol
768 gb of ram dude 🥲 my one is 8gb even my ssd is smaller than ur ram which is 512 gb omg
So what you’re saying is it’s good for college cuz I won’t need to plug it in during class?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m44s">1:44</a> “top notch design” I see what you did there lol
The notch... No
I have DT880 600ohms, does someone know how it sounds?
The one review that I’ve been waiting for is here! Let’s go!!!
Does anyone know the intro track?
Who else heard him say 768Gb of Ram😳
I wouldn’t call it backward, this macbook went FORWARD. Touchbar was garbage and the lack of ports on previous MacBooks was super garbage.
Top Notch Design! Didn&#39;t see that coming!
TopNotch just makes the menu bar black to it blends in with the notch.
This is insane. ARM really is the future.
does it run netflix smooth?
It&#39;s OK, Marques. I heard the &quot;top-notch&quot; pun.
everything is nice in this laptop but what about SSD Lifespan because apple now solder everything on motherboard there is no way to replace it after ssd lifespan
The airline luggage savings might already justify this laptop’s cost for you.
No covering it&#39;s gaming weaknesses and compatibility issues (i.e. bootcamp?).  You cover what it does well thoroughly and actually don&#39;t touch at all on what it DOESN&#39;t do.
Is there actually a new sd card design in planning =? I mean its really huge.
When can the engineering world just switch to MacOS ?
I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus.
Apple wants you to buy their next gen product of this. Next time they will add HDMI 2.1, UHS 3 (SD Card), Ethernet port on charging brick and face ID plus whatever CPU upgrade....

I&#39;m amazed such huge channels as Margues is still using Final Cut and not the adobe suite.
Macs aren’t my primary gaming machine (I use consoles), but for the games I play on computer (strategy, business sim) Mac OS runs most of them, so I think I’ll spring for the max
The intro of this video is better then any Apple Ad
All the benchmarks seem to be comparing it to previous Intel Macs (you know, the ones that are under-clocked, under-volted, and thermally throttle because of Apple&#39;s poor thermal design), and older Intel and AMD CPUs, but what about recent AMD CPUs or even Intel&#39;s brand new Alder Lake chips? <br>It&#39;s really hard to gauge how great the performance is in that regard, and considering the RAM is unified, unlike a traditional (modern) computer, there&#39;s likely a lot of software optimisation and swapping going on. It&#39;d be nice to see a far more technical analysis because whilst M1 is clearly impressive, it really does seem to have its performance greatly exaggerated.
I hope the menubar will soon become slightly smaller just to match the size of the notch. <br><br>These pixels underneath the notch drives me crazy 😜
So they&#39;re regressed back to a propriety charging port and called it an upgrade.... How Apple of them
These videos are very informative. I do video editing on Final Cut Pro. I am trying to decide if I should trade in my 2019 16&#39; Mac Book Pro for the new MacBook Pro, or wait for the updated Mac mini?
Curious to see how it compares to like a razer blade 15 with a 3080 price to performance
I want some free shit for literally doing the same thing as virtually everyone else on Youtube but on a bigger scale.<br>Go earn some shit.
Alright since no one&#39;s asking I would. &quot;But, can it run run Crysis&quot;
To this point, just go and buy the socks and sandals already. See ya in a year.
When are they shipping?? I ordered my 16 inch M1 Max on Oct 21 and it&#39;s still &quot;processing&quot;.
i&#39;d be fine with a macbook air, but i&#39;m a sucker for the latest and greatest screen tech so macbook pro it is
When my channel takes off I’m going to get one of these decked out 😊
That camera work 😍
&quot;These Macs have a new top notch design.&quot;<br>I see what you did there. 😏
Apple should hire mkbhd to shoot its product video 👍
Every MKBHD intro is mind-blowing!
Does this one also suffer the memory leak issue that M1 has?
Whenever apple introduces some &quot;inconveniences&quot; like this notch, it will be like &quot;when you actually start using it, days roll we won&#39;t notice it, we will get used to it, blah, blah, blah&quot;. Why put it!
Why no ethernet?
That a remix to Allta&#39;s song??
Think of the power M3 Pro and Max! Maybe we get 1st party Apple Games that are AAA
Top notch design. Was waiting for the joke and got it. Small things can make you happy.
Looks like u dont get one hand open as i saw in the start
OMG U LIKE C2C, VERY COOL LIKE EVEN MORE!
Still doesn’t have room for a socketed NVME 🤥
won a few thousands from football betting this week and was debating whether or not to get the m1 max or the sony a1, i think photography&#39;s gonna have to take a slight break because i feel like i just watched softcore porn with those specs
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m50s">9:50</a> worlds most subtlest flex lmao
I bought the new Macbook Pro 16&quot; (M1 Pro). I have to say - it&#39;s the BEST laptop on the market. The power - incredible. The battery life - mind blowing. Speakers - great. Honestly, I&#39;ve been waiting for this laptop since last year and it&#39;s so worth the wait.



































SO true about the ethernet on the power adapter, would be even more valuable (and make more sense) on a laptop than on the imac!

Bro really took 3 weeks to make a 20min 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 L channel. L content. L life.
its the ports for me
768 gigs of ram. 😵‍💫
I have a macbook pro mid 2010, so I agree this one is next level
Wow. Lots of &quot;new&quot; hardware features 😂🤣😂🤣
I kinda dont like how nobody is talking about how you waited a week i mean they should send the computer to a new person or request it back

You know what I can&#39;t wait for??? Apple to eliminate the ability to download and install applications outside of the Mac store. Its really surprising to me how  easily reviewers relinquished their ability to upgrade components.
ruining a beautiful piece of hardware with an ugly sticker!
you get it where the future tech is going
Finally !!!!!
It&#39;s like Apple did a real Customer Development and listened to us for the first time after half a decade.
assuming that&#39;s a nifty dbrand skin on that pixel 6 b/c it looks awesome and a lot like my old panda pixel 2xl
These intros are just getting better and better
Great video. Great content and presentation. Thanks!
Apple actually listening to it&#39;s customers is mind blowing. Because that RARELY happens.
I am completely psyched to replace my 2015 MBP with this. I was worried I wouldn&#39;t have another good MBP again when they started making the thin touch bar bois.
I truly love watching your videos, especially when your reviews, legitimately, validate my purchase decisions (even with my level of frugality; I usually sit on decisions for up to a year before pulling the trigger).<br><br>This is my first-ever Macbook Pro and I’m 💯 satisfied with my purchase this year. 👌🏼
Gosh, I can&#39;t wait to buy one ~ mONEY comE To ME .. Time to retire my imac max out 2017 with a simple base model laptop and get more out of it ..
&quot;New top notch design&quot; killed me lmao
I don&#39;t think you would want ethernet on a magnetic connector.. Just add more ports would be better, in my opinion
I don&#39;t think anyone could truly justify a notch on a laptop
Why every reviewer assumes that everyone is a video editor 🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m09s">17:09</a> m1 max mbp***
Can someone tell me if they have tried architecture softwares like Archicad and Lumion!? Do those softwares benefit from the M1 chip?
Can&#39;t wait for mine to get here. Should be next week!<br><br>Also, small technicality in the wording you used. Saying it &quot;Dropped 2% from 96% to 94%&quot; isn&#39;t correct. It is said that it drops two POINTS. Not percent. 2% - 96% gets you 94.02% which is totally close enough for rock and roll, but only because that&#39;s so close to 100. On the other hand if the numbers were from 22% to 20%, that is closer to a 9% drop. A 2% drop from that would be 21.56%. So in that instance it is better to say 2 points.<br><br>I&#39;m fun at parties, I swear. I don&#39;t bring any of this stuff up. I just have a  couple drinks and dance.
It&#39;s not just the extra GPU cores - if you need more than 32GB of RAM, it&#39;s the Max or nothing.
marques u need a haircut and  a shave. and apply some lotion man YW.
A new top notch design literally 😂
So apple finally made something that deserves its price
which intel cpu does it copare to in price?
do you think ppl are done with the touch bar?
I like how he uses the pixel phone and yet wears an apple watch ;)
“It only has 64gb of ram, where the Mac Pro has 768gbs of ram.” It’s still mind blowing that the Mac Pro can take up to like 1.2 TB of RAM.
The people complaining about the notch are just seeing the glass half empty. Your mac&#39;s screen expanded into the space around the notch, not the other way around.
When you said &quot;768 gigs of RAM&quot; you literally have more RAM than I have storage ffs
Literally ”top notch design”😂
Is this laptop NEXT LEVEL ?!
I’ve already evolved away from the need for a dedicated charger. USB-C all the way for me. All of the other changes are welcome. I’m excited to get mine.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m39s">2:39</a> i see what you did there (ﾉ*･ω･)ﾉ
I thought the 4 minutes was already on high performance mode wow
Got the base 14&quot; and I&#39;ve edited photos in lightroom for 4 hours, did some emailing, watched a few Youtube videos (including this one) and took some photos in Photobooth. Still above 50% battery! Super fast too I am thrilled.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m50s">8:50</a> ... Valle dei Templi?


Thank you for the shout-out to the TouchBar. Stupid move to remove it altogether... 🤦


I had been waiting for this unbiased review as a designer. I guess my 24kg, 32core xeon power hungry 1200w workstation has to be replaced by a 14&quot; M1 pro macbook. That goes for Nvidia GPU&#39;s too.. I could save on power at a bare minimum.


Hah! You just thinking about dongle? I m thinking about this much money 💰, which I don&#39;t have... 😀
Was waiting for this one!!
Intro sounds like “shot on the dick” key n peels sketch
i need that groot plant ....
about remote desktop? Carry a small Mac and remotely access the iMac.
you talk a lot about 8k etc but all you need is 1080, am I wrong?
Your reviews are ‘Truly Next Level’! Much appreciated.
That intro was truly next level !
Just got my MacBook air m1 stolen. Might have to pick up something new…
The audio is a bit out of sync

If you can fit that much power and efficiency into a laptop, would the size/design of the Mac Pro still make sense? Would the next gen Mac Pro shrink? I would hope so.
Finally been waiting for your review.
Why is there an enema bottle on the table 😶
&quot;Top notch design&quot; hehehe
No ethernet port? I like piped internet for faster uploads.
My eyes can&#39;t decide whether to stare at the beautiful machine or the adorable Groot plant in the background











Apple=🗑️
Not even a MacBook user and I want one!
30 seconds in, already smashed the like button! MKBHD GOAT!
I wish the charger brick sat flush against the wall
I&#39;m wondering about that face Id - if they were to integrate it in the future. The technology is based on infrared light so couldn&#39;t it be harmful to your eyes if that is beaming into your eyes all day? Just see how phones beam constantly with an infrared camera but eventually you spend less time on the cell screen than on a work monitor.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m52s">3:52</a> shot is not graded.


Its just huge - that is not a step forward.


Welcome back macbook pro 2015 😔 <br>- old magsafe 🤦<br>- old headphone  🤦 <br>- old SD Card slot 😌<br>- HDMI 🤦<br>👉 5 year later....<br>- come back USB type C  | 2 port or 3 port <br>This all new apple 🍎 products 🔜🔙🔜🔙


how does bootcamp run on them?


Socks and sandals...Jeez! hell no!


It has a notch 😭😭😭😭😭😭


I’ve been cutting on Mac laptops for almost 20 years now, initially using a cut down version of Avid, then eventually on FCP. They were always a less efficient workflow but ameliorated because of gear portability. I have the 13” MBP with only 16Gb RAM, which has been a much more useful way to cut 4k than my old maxed out 5,1 cheese grater. I’m (as so many of us are) waiting for delivery of my M1 Pro with 32Gb RAM and a 2Tb of internal storage but in a 14” version because a lot of my work is done while traveling around Asia and Europe, so a kilo or so of weight reduction is awesome. This is going to be such a welcome addition to the arsenal of so many traveling content creators (journalists, video artists, VJ’s,etc) who will have so much more fun creating work with all the extra horsepower. Now, if only we can get you guys to stop with the ridiculous 8k rubbish. If you can’t get it in 4k, you’re just wasting storage space, or, if you’re doing content for multiplex projection, why are you not carrying a 27” 4k second screen with you to get your grading done better? Oh, and 2.7k proxies are an editors best friend.

16 inch should have numpad


This MacBook can support three monitors right? So do not give up on that huge carry case, still lots to lug through the airport.
I&#39;m  still looking  where I can put my flash disk in that  laptop


As I’ll be rich, I’ll buy full spec M1 max.<br><br>That’s my life goal 🥸


i liked the video just for the intro so cool :)


Jesus 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾


Until I start watching his videos I used to think that gaming consumes most power in laptop and video editing can be done on phones also.. 😌


poor ethernet


Antoher video where I&#39;ll never be able to purchase whats been reviewed


Aight, imma go beg my employer to switch me to one of these.
Since the 16” has a 160W charger, does that mean you would have to have a separate charger for flying? If I’m not mistaken the max you can fly with is 100w?

But how about replace that Mac Pro too? Are you that confident to do that.


hate the fact that its thicker than nicky minaj ass! ill wait for 15 inch macbook air


The notch that size for future versions and fitting in Face ID


I’m sure that the notch is that big, just to make more attractive future models. We know how Apple works…











<b>That  intro is sick</b>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m04s">17:04</a> Editing mistake marques - it&#39;s the M1 Max, you wrote M1 Pro
Some rich kid will buy this to write notes in Microsoft word at UNI


me on  14 year old laptop🤣🤣🤣


aespa?


Still waiting for my 16 M1 Max, but there are no questions anymore for me about this Mac, thanks! BTW, no color grading at this point <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m56s">3:56</a> ? :)


@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m06s">17:06</a> same listing for M1 Pro MBP listed twice. This mistake happened a few times in this video.


I’m sure that the notch is that big, just to make more attractive future models. We know how Apple works…

so pretty good - in a pinch... :-)


All these youtube reviews are just video editing reviews. Disappointed.


Pretty nice review Marques. Too bad I still have to wait for an indefinite time until my 16&quot; MBP arrives. It&#39;s saddening to see all the tech youtubers review it and my company tells me they can&#39;t get their hands on MBPs due to shortage in stock.


Congrats for 15 million in advance 🎉🎊🔥💥
I AM GROOT!
I mean, you could edit videos on a standard laptop, but ok.


This video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m18s">20:18</a>... 😘


The review we all waited for
You should edit and upload a video with imovie and use 100% of the capabilities
I&#39;ll buy one of these in 2 years when they fix some of the things like upgrading to the faster 2.1 hdmi port and the sd card, put face id in it or make the notch smaller, consequental soc upgrade, and whatever else they give it. Seriously these machines look awesome, and if you can have vms on them it&#39;ll be perfect for what I would want to do with one.
I want this MacBook so bad 😭😭😭 great video 😁
Maybe the notch is the size it is because they want to add face ID in the future, and rather than make it as small as possible now and increase the size later, they&#39;ll add in face ID and possibly make it smaller, and get way better press?
iSheep





Lmao that dig at Linus <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m32s">12:32</a>
M1 max I guarantee will game very well. My main reason for not going PC for gaming is because Fuck windows.
how come low impedance speakers require more power, but high impedance headphones require more power?





Tbh i hate the new design
This is not next level by industry standards, just by Apple standards. Asus has a Laptop with basically the same specs but half the price and better gpu performance. The only unique thing is it&#39;s low power consumption.
What&#39;s with apple and notches??
Really? A top-“notch” design? 🤣


How long until MKBHD upgrades to 16K cameras and maxes out these machines! Haha


I have a question.<br>would the M1 chips negate the need for an audio interface with DSP (e.g UA Apollo/Antelope etc). Whole campaign to buy these products with DSP chips in was they could run natively on the hardware and your DAW session wouldn&#39;t crash. reason im asking is im in the market for an audio interface and was wondering if i could get one without DSP and get the MBP max instead and get a decent AI without DSP.
I do like Touch bar. Should have been a option.


Why not RDP connect to iMac



Next level with a notched screen. Wow!!! Yea MKBHD. Power yea looks notched krap.



My thinkpad t430 is crying rn


“Top notch design” … nice
CS:GO fps at 1080p ??
MacBook 2017 remastered.


&quot;There are ports now. There are REAL ports.&quot; - Those are imPORTant? 😅


Nice walk back actions 😅👍🏿


Linus socks and sandals 🤣🤣🤣


MKBHAPPLED 70% of the videos are apple


Am I the only one seeing HUGEMONGOUS Razer Blade vibes on this new MBP desing?

I wish they’d kept the digital audio out of the headphone jacks as they did in the mid 2000’s. That was much more useful than many people realised at the time.


1.1K notch haters in the house


Finally !
One less dongle


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m15s">8:15</a> Jugs


Gaming? Anything for that tho because I do 3d graphics work and game aswell and I take my laptop out aswell while traveling I have a pc at home for that good good gaming so now I need a good laptop


Apple really killed this generation of Macbook Pro&#39;s!!! I started using Macs with the 2012 MacBook Pro models. Then bought the 2016 refreshed model with Touch Bar. The improvements with the new generation really makes me happy seeing Apple is somewhat listening to customers again. I would like to see Face ID, HDMI 2.1, and an Ethernet Jack (Probably wont happen) in the feature. I also hope they can somehow bring back a form of Boot Camp for those that want to use the hardware without a virtual machine (would be great for IT people). Again probably will have to download Parallels from now on. I am personally going to wait another 2 years, just to give developers a little more time optimize their software/applications. I am also hoping Apple can bring the prices down in the 2 years a bit. Again very very impressed!
Finally u posted the review that I’m waited for💯


I wonder if you can play video games on that laptop?

Were those export times with iPhone footage or Red footage??
mkbhd is always the most honest and professional tech reviewer out there. throwing out praises and also making titbits of remarks to apple and honestly hope that they&#39;ll take into account, like colour-matching of the megsafe port to the laptop&#39;s colour and the notch situation etc. its out there, not too soft, and not too hard, and always with a light-hearted touch. those are the things that make me prioritise your reviews over others


On camera these look uglier than the previous generation.. <br>you guys need to see these machines with your eyes.. 13 inch models don’t look good anymore..

If the HDMI Port would be 2.1 i would have bought it. A dealbreaker
Gaming on a Mac should be a thing!


Everyone stroking that M1 hard
Lmao u realize there are gaming laptiops that are as powerful as an imac right? Or do u need a mac specifically?
I&#39;m still genuinely confused as to the benefit of an HDMI port (and even if it was 2.1 that will age) as opposed to a thunderbolt port you could use with more advanced monitors that use that or plug a dongle in to for HDMI or whatever else you might want. Just seems like a multi-use port is better than...HDMI.
Tried the macbook pro 14inch and don’t know why but it sort of hanged while using fcpx i tried closing it.. didn’t work.. i switched apps, added and removed new windows, pressed the cross butten around 20 times but it won’t close..
yeah but who uses the official reddit app


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m55s">16:55</a> M1 Max should be next on the text I think


Oh thanks Apple fan. It looks like everything is perfect with this laptop. What an honest review! I believe if they remove the touch pad you will still find a good review about it.” Well I usually use a mouse so it’s good to have some space for the wrists.”


wait i thought these macbook pros weren&#39;t good for editing in premier, only final cut?


Editing the very video at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=5m40s">5:40</a> mark we&#39;re watching on the actual machine he&#39;s reviewing... 🤯
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m35s">16:35</a> woah, woah woah... what is that Pixel colour in your hand?!
This is not directed at Marques but someone needs to make a compliation of all the reviewers saying how revolutionary it was to go only USB-C for 2016-2020 and how it was &quot;tHe FuTuRe&quot;
Been waiting for MKBHD! Finally...
Awesome video. M1 Max here I come.


This review is SO much better than all the others I have seen (and I have seen al LOT). Please take the time you need but continue on this way of doing video
Lew: No Doongleee<br>Marques: One less dongle
“New top notch design” ah I see what you did there
Yep, I guess I&#39;ll have to do 3 jobs now to get this XD

socks and sandals😂😂😂😂 seriously?🤣 Ouch!!
TheVerge review is super suspicious, how it happened that 3060 twice faster than  3070?
Great review Marques!


Please do something on METAVERSE

Those who can&#39;t afford.. where yall at?


Sorry I am just confused: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m25s">2:25</a> - &quot;There&#39;s ports now.&quot; Ports is pural so why not &quot;There are ports now?&quot; I mean I hear this from a lot of guys and I just can&#39;t understand.
only 4 PRO 😃😃


Notch. The design equivalent of walking out of the bathroom with the toilet roll tucked into the rear of your pants.



it&#39;s new powerbook
Top-notch design, cute.


Socks and sandals like Linus 😂😂🔥


A lot of people who don’t  need  this much power  But Just Have A of Money To Spend  and just want to get a nice laptop.
last week, i went to the apple store with my parents when they where going to but a phone 13. while the were ordering it (cuz it was not  in stock is that relatable in india?) i saw a 2021 macbook. i was the latest one. I HAD ONE THING ON MY MIND. <br><br><br><br><br>how will the cursor interact with the huge iphone like notch?<br><br>yea, as i expected the answer was disappointing.<br>it was quite buggy in the store version, sometimes it would teleport to the other side of the notch, other times it would simply not bother about the notch &amp; clip through it.<br><br>its quite disappointing how the design team don&#39;t work with the software team.
If only I had a few thousand spare dollars to splurge with here…
You come off as competent yet humble. The latter is one of your strongest assets and is likely a big part of your success.  Pls don’t lose this attribute, ever.


I feel they made the notch the size it is because later on in future macs when they want to add Face ID they would not have to make it bigger to fit it in. Going from having a small notch for only a camera to in the next MacBook making a bigger notch to be able to Face ID will not look good. That’s why they kept in big now .


Dare time. Give away one of them.


If this is impressive, what are we getting when the mac pro comes with it&#39;s own chip? Will I even have time to go to the bathroom while exporting a video...? 😂
Top notch review
This is nuts. Now… 30” iMac with two M1 Max and 128GB RAM? 6K, Nanotexture?
Do you ever get cringy watching yourself while editing?
If this is huge power brick can you imagine the small one
I&#39;m glad the MagSafe charger is back, but god, why did they put a fucking notch to the MacBook? Ugly af.
The very expensive imac should not be able to have &#39;in a pinch&#39; applied to any of its features.
&quot;Let&#39;s talk about the top notch design&quot;<br><br>I see what you did there
Worth the wait for this review!  Glad you can finally retire that beast of a travelling companion.
Nice ad. But it&#39;s got a hole in the screen ;P
Can’t wait for my 16 inch maxed out😍 sooo hyped
Thanks, MKB
your reviews on what is missing (not much needed) is like what they intentionally didn&#39;t do so they have something new to offer on the next gen of the laptops and its freaking marketing strategy lol, its not like they didn&#39;t thought about it, they have that idea but its for the next generation!!!
Still debating whether to squeeze another 24 months out of my 2013 13&quot; MBP Retina thingy. I don&#39;t need mega performance, but I DO need longevity. So far my MBP rarely spins up the fan, the screen is awesome, the keyboard and ports are similar. I could bet the farm and go for it, or wait a while and get something cheaper that will take me into my 60&#39;s. $0.02
&quot;&quot; Yesterday is history &quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot; Tomorrow is mystery &quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot; Today is gift &quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot; That&#39;s why it&#39;s called present &quot;&quot;❤️❤️❤️❤️
&quot;&quot; Yesterday is history &quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot; Tomorrow is mystery &quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot; Today is gift &quot;&quot;<br>&quot;&quot; That&#39;s why it&#39;s called present &quot;&quot;❤️❤️❤️❤️
Does anyone here use MacBook/Mac for music production? Specifically making beats, I’ve been wanting to get into making beats and from my research and video watching, most producers use MacBooks. Just wondering if this MacBook would be ideal for it? Or would a older model suffice?


My only complain with this new macbook pro is the less cores compared with intel version. I use a mac for working in bioinformatics and need parallelization, threads or cores. The GPU cores not needed in my case. Hope to Apple add more cores in the future in other macbook. Because with my 16 inch i9 with 64 gb ram I very happy for a long time more.



This sold me for my work machine. Pitching this to my bosses presently. <br><br>PS is that a panda 6 or the 6 pro you are using?
Not many people need to edit and export a video like you do. How many people need a laptop like this? I think the regular work stations are what’s really important not to mention the unleashed power supply on a desktop.
Games devs need to start targeting Macs now.   Metal + M1 = amazing.
I kinda hate how they had to go back on the ports. Don’t get me wrong I hate the adapters and they never should have removed the SD card slot, but I was hoping the industry would adopt USB-C for everything. The amount of people who would ask me what do I need to plug in a monitor and I have to say it depends confusing them even more  is a lot. It would be nice to just hand them a USB-C cable and say here ya go this can do everything.
Marques did you go snorkeling or something before this video? Looks like you got goggle imprints


Do you think these influences are paid to boost these things?
How do you even one up this? Will the Apple silicon desktop render and export 16k footage in less than a minute? Difficult for me to imagine how you can take it to the next level from here, which makes the M1 Max that damn impressive.


You got me intrigued. But what about Windows PC users switching to Apple ecosystem? I&#39;m afraid of losing a lot of time learning all the Apple stuff from zero.<br>Especially when I need a laptop to edit videos at work, but once I return home it&#39;s back to my Windows PC Xeon tower.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a> ha. ha. ha.


Socks and sandals lol … oh Linus…..
They have a new top notch design. Good one!


2027
Have used windows laptop nevr used mac but want to switch is this good laptop for general web browsing , movies etc running mulitple apps at the same time

If Intel wasn&#39;t so busy extracting all kinds of money from their customers while barely improving their products, Apple wouldn&#39;t have had to design their own chips. So really, Intel&#39;s mismanagement brought us Ryzen CPUs and M1 macs. It&#39;s exciting to see what else we can come up with. The world of tech is ever-evolving.


So many comments about the content and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s fantastic, but I just started the video and I want everyone to acknowledge how absolutely fantastic that intro was. The timing, the framing, the colours and composition... beautiful.

Finally an MKBHD REVIEW. This time there was glitch in the TENET as MKBHD  worked backwards after stealing the reviews from the future.


MKBHD is the best. He&#39;s the tech mogul for sure 🔥. Big fan bro ❤️


Top notch review right here


finally.


wow wow I have be waiting for this video🙏



It&#39;s about time you do one of those &quot;What&#39;s on my Smartphone&quot; video, 2021 edition !!


At least now Marques will no longer need to carry an iMac Pro with him while travelling


A different screen background would have been nice when you were talking about the display. Much love. ❤️


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m32s">12:32</a> we’ll hold you to that


can it furn crysis though ??


Perfect timing since mine finally shipped today 😅











No - the world does not need another socks and sandals wearer!
They should make the next iMac 27&quot; as removable stand so it will be easier to carry around for people like you


Useless for me. I wait MacMini with passive cooling, with good dynamic sounds and M1 Max on the board.


Great clip, you&#39;ve probably had a million comments saying this but the benchmark times has M1 Pro listed twice and not Max


that intro though!!!


Nobody catching this beast 😂😂😂


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m54s">0:54</a> - &quot;It&#39;s been the smallest machine that I could take with me to one of those events that could render and edit and export a video...&quot; while running macOS and Final Cut. Just want to put out there that there was a whole generation of Windows laptops that had RTX 2080s and such and were ripping through edits and renders on the go.

DId you forget to color the shot at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m51s">3:51</a>? 👀


I want a 16inch non Pro Macbook


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m21s">0:21</a> ooh, I have seen nothing done as bad as this 2021 on the back of this macbook on this channel so far, take it as a compliment.


Came here to dislike the video....


Although I agree with the almost the whole video, the defense for the notch seems very out of place. I would MAYBE defend it if it had face unlock out of the gate, but it doesn&#39;t with only vague promises they will in the future. If the feature is not ready, don&#39;t put the hardware at launch. I&#39;m pretty sure your customers will wait next year when it&#39;s ready, meanwhile I believe the notch is obnoxious. I will continue to say this about the iphone as well, but that&#39;s a lost battle at this point and at least it has a practical purpose.<br><br>I even believe you can spare a bit of bezel for the camera.


hate apple all u want but they have just kicked intel ass


you are more forgiving on apple about the power of the ports than you were on google pixel 6pro for not being quite pro enough




Excelent video, except for the Google Pixel appearance.


at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m08s">17:08</a> there is a small mistake, you wrote M1 Pro MBP instead of M1 Max MBP on the fifth line.
Sir 768 gb of ram😲😲 for real means What do you do with so much power I mean🤯🤯
the explanation is very simple: next year when they introduce FaceID, Apple CANNOT present an bigger notch compared to the previous one. This way, next year they can say: &quot;hey, we included so many more feature inside the notch without increasing its size!&quot;


Man this review was worth waiting


Everyone always got on him about how early his reviews came out because he had the device for so long. Now he made us wait longer for what we all wanted 😂
Are there any Ableton videos on the new mbp&#39;s? Also third party vst&#39;s etc?


Just received my new M1 Pro 16inch.<br>10-Core CPU<br>16-Core GPU<br>16GB Unified Memory<br>It is truly the next level. Performance, batteries, display all top class.
Doing any giveaways


Prediction before watching the review : He&#39;s gonna excuse the notch and say &quot;your get used to it&quot;



I can&#39;t stand the f*** notch.


I wish there was a 16&quot; with a m1 lite or something that was less expensive. The MacBook air is too small for me, and I only use my laptop for web usage and remote control of my server or gaming desktop.


“A new top notch design”<br><br>S m o o t h


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=05m34s">05:34</a>


I&#39;m an Engineering student... I need to get a laptop for doing simulations and rendering.... I was planning to get the ThinkPad series until I came to know about this one..... Now I&#39;m confused... Can anyone help me choose one???<br><br><br>NB: I don&#39;t have the money to buy all the softwares and was planning to download cracked versions of the softwares. Mac is new for me and I don&#39;t know whether I can use such softwares in it. Can anyone who is in this field guide me??


I was torn between this and the surface studio laptop. I kept jumping back and forth. I eventually made the leap and bought the MacBook. I went home, loaded up everything and it quickly went into recovery mode on its own and never came back out of it. <br><br>It was my first MacBook. I’ve used apple phones but never laptops. Not sure what to do now lol

I love watching review of tech i am never going to buy


The M1 Max chip has insane performance per watt. I have the 1st generation M1 MBP and I still am amazed I can edit H265 R5 footage (no transcoding or rendering) for hours on a battery in FCP. Apple is killing it with these machines.
What if you charge an iPhone with a mac brick?


I don&#39;t get why they still don&#39;t have touchscreen options


Carrying an iMac is kinda dumb... you could of just remote connected to it and do your work on a ChromeBook or something~
Socks and sandals around Disney World


Took forever to put out your review and... It&#39;s a basic, shallow overview...


Thanks for this video


I&#39;m not a motion designer anymore but I would love to have the Max, been with my late 2013 for a loooong time.
Don&#39;t write a review from your perspective, rather think it in terms of common folks whether they are better of without making that much spending or not.Don&#39;t be just another paid review man.

My 14” has been shipped. I can’t wait for it to arrive, the wait is killing me. It will be my first apple computer!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m06s">17:06</a> the last one should say “M1 Max MBP <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>”
Can’t get over how dated that design looks.
You clearly don&#39;t fly Spirit...


if it would have a touchscreen i would consider it


WORTH WAITING 👑


Actually “Next Level!” ☝️🤩👍✨
More like the pricing is &quot;truly on THE NEXT LEVEL!”





“Top notch design”. I see what you did there. 👀
I&#39;ve always been a Windows guy, but I&#39;m seriously considering a MacBook for editing. As good as my laptop is, it still struggles sometimes with higher res footage
The “muahh” kiss after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m15s">20:15</a> is everything. I’m sold 😂


I never considered to get a MacBook pro because it&#39;s totally overpriced here in Brazil, but so many positive reviews is making me wish I could get myself one of those.


I&#39;ll accept the notch when we get FaceID


I was waiting for this to come out for a year. I have two M1 machines for my work, mac Mini and Mac Book Air and now it seems that I do not really need this at all. I mean for sure it would be great, but looking what those machines I have provided me in my day-to-day work. I m slightly disappointed to conclude I do not need really this Pro version. Pro is a tool, and a fool with a tool is still a fool. 🤣





My audio wave forms have been disappearing lately on the latest FCPX version (on my older iMac). So I think that might be software-related. Not necessarily a problem with the new M1 Maxbook.


No USB port though?! 😢 That would be useful.





I was impressed with the MBP M1 Max till he said:<br>&quot;the mac pro I&#39;ve edited on has S E V E N   H U N D R E D   A N D   S I X T Y  E I G H T   gigs of ram????&quot;<br>😳 Let that sink in for a second!!

I still can&#39;t quite beleve the performance numbers. Mental improvements like these just point out how intel have been holding back the whole industry.




When are we getting a video about that GMMK Pro keyboard I see sitting there!




Great review as always





top notch design lol
I&#39;m still okay with my MacBook Pro Intel 13&quot; early 2020 edition :P





notch. first world problmz
Lol <br>While giving reviews of android phones you have mac in background <br>And while giving review of macbook, Google phone in hand 😂😂




Got the fully specc&#39;d out M1 MAX too!..... too bad it arrives in 6 weeks
love how apple is pushing forward with their own SOC&#39;s but that notch and design just doesnt beat the previous design. <br>But hey, cant get it all right :D




<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m07s">17:07</a> .... last one should be M1 Max MBP** instead of M1 pro MBP





Is it possible to be a gamer on M1?

By the way, I do games on my Macbook Pro 2017, and it does it well. These machines are amazing, it&#39;s the game industry that does not serve them well. But the hardware is there.





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a><br>I loudly Hahaaaa’d<br>That’s impressive




Mines arriving in a few hours


I can’t believe i bought the mac pro 13 inch and then this shit came out! What the fuck. I can still return it… i have 3 days left.🤣🤣🤣


Apple should give a Firmware update to let their CPU’s have a little more power juice of about 5-10 watts so we can see their full potential at the expense of battery life.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m50s">9:50</a> that&#39;s what i call a presidential flex 👊🏼


So much money for three years of performance and 5 years support notch thanks


Super hyped for mine to arrive. Game changing for getting more creative 🙌🏾


so basically they went back to 2011 design macbook and called &quot;out of this world&quot; lol


&quot;Only has 64 GB of RAM&quot; Hmmm...


I know the pain of carrying a Imac around man i used 1 for work and i have to travel with that thing in a pelican case as well lol


I can&#39;t wait until window machines catch up. As an engineer I have software that is windows only but that performance looks so juicy


Yo Marques. Is this &quot;next level&quot;?


Can you look at how these Macs work with Audio?<br>I have seen a video where someone created a track using just the Mac&#39;s internal Mics<br>Wow....



Tbh, I never notice the notch when I use my 16in M1 Max


That Linus burn tho 🔥🤣


Nonsense review... who uses FCX professionally and wants to be taken seriously?


Performance looks unbelievable but is it just me who really isn&#39;t into the design? To me it&#39;s reminiscent of the old like 2005 design it feels just a bit redundant.


&quot;in a pinch&quot;


First of all: great review! I&#39;m seriously considering just using the a new MacBook as both portable device as well as home computer (with a nice dock and an additional display). <br><br>What I would really love to see is how you yourself deal with the entire workflow, from shooting, to importing data and working with it, to rendering and saving files somewhere. I wonder how you&#39;ve handled storage on-the-go and in the studio for example and what templates / workflows you use to optimize the entire process :) Would be great to see a video on that!<br><br>Cheers.




So since the 140 brick is just a standalone brick, what would happen if you plugged in an iphone?


Finally &lt;3
&quot;Unbox Therapy&quot; also uses the phrase &quot;DONGLE&quot;! That word keeps getting stuck in my head, though I&#39;ve never heard that word before!
How the freak does Marques find this awesome of music
This machine is truly impressive. No more dongle life and more!
one of the most beautiful laptop ever made
&quot;Only has 64 gig of Ram&quot;... I must be so old that I recall when Bill Gates said 64k was more than anyone would ever need.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m10s">6:10</a> its apple, what did you expect (i can say cause i also use apple)
That machine is a monster
Did he just say 768 gigs of RAM?
Marques : The Macbook is a tool for your job..<br>People whose job is to make Macbook :  😑
“New top notch design” haha
Why did you take the mac with you? You could remotely render the video no?
I swear the intro sounded like apple bottom jeans
Anyone’s having a problem with screen flickering in M1 mac?
This review is bananas.
Jesus this intro.... 😍
Show this guy an item with an Apple logo on it and he will but 10.
Pc user who uses After Effects, Premiere and Cinema4D. Curious to see how this machine handles these softwares.
“I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day, like Linus.” Note that down!
can i install linux on this laptop?
I’m sitting here trying to justify upgrading to one of these from my 2018 intel MacBook Pro. I need that extra power for watching YouTube videos and typing pages documents 😂
I love how you can have the menu bar stay at the top now all the time when in full screen. It’s a really nice thing to have.


I have a question if you could put one eye on something i discovered when comparing the iPad Pro 12,9 XDR display with the new MacBook pro 16 XDR display. When watching Avangers Endgame (the final battle scene) on both devices I notice a much higher dynamic (HDR) on the iPad, as the MAcBook in compare looks like a non XDR display. As both devices have XDR displays with mini LED and the same Nits specs it should look the same on the iPad and the Macbook.
I feel like Marques is more nerdy and emotional this time. I love this).
why does it come with a charging brick lol
قدرات خارقة على نظام مغلق مالفائدة؟
It is to my eyes the nicest design Mac laptop to date however, I wish they offered it in gun-metal grey or a nice matte black, and hardware-wise, its pretty great but WOW is it expensive, as much as $6,500 AUD for the top-spec 16 inch model. That&#39;s nowhere near affordable for most of us, I can&#39;t afford it. I guess its fine for business buyers as its tax-deductible and increased productivity.
I&#39;ve said it before: Everyone else makes halfway decent tools with passable paint jobs, and a modest tool box. Apple doesn&#39;t make tools. It makes <i>functional artwork</i>
great review
Marques flexing how Obama follows him lol
But the real question is which colour
The Macbook Pro line shouldn&#39;t be Apple&#39;s way to show off how thin a laptop can be, it should be their powerhouse laptop. They can use their other laptop categories for ultra thin laptops and their Pro line can be more bulky but more useful.
Send me one bro ❤️😊
Gotta do something about the audio lol little annoying hearing your mouth click every time you talk
For all the praise Jony Ive got he also seemed to be behind the craze for thinness and losing ports etc. Glad to see them back!


Why record in this horrible aspect ratio? I bloody hate black bars on my screen... such a waste
it is silly to celebrate
Jesus man, why did you start making 20min video? Is it the YT algorithm?<br>I mean I love your videos for 5 min. I tolerate two more because i’m so so and I stayed for the last 3 coz I got that far. Nov I either scroll more than half of the video or watch you on 2.0 speed.

The jump is like going from HDD to SSD 😆. Next Level!
Last time I&#39;ve used ethernet cables is <b>over</b> 10 years ago.
I’ve been waiting a while for this review! Amazing job!
Brilliant review
travel iMac lol
I hope that on April 1st, they make it so the pointer doesn&#39;t go through the notch and you have to go around it.
the touch bar was absolutely awesome and was looking great  .... idk why they removed it ...
Imagine giving anything you can need in a portable pc and not giving the gigabit which is in the previous model and doesn&#39;t require any effort....also safari doesn&#39;t support the technology their creator made. That&#39;s apple thing at it&#39;s best.<br>P.S. DT 770 Pro are amazing!
Umm so the new m1 has the most powerful Integrated gpu? (ʘᴗʘ✿)
.. or Macbook Air .. cuz $$, which is amazing on its own right.
just guessing, maybe when you open the MacBook, the notch will save you from hurting the display with your thumb? Because in the M1 version I always get thumbprints in the camera area that I am always scared that I can over-pressing the monitor glass.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m48s">2:48</a> what mackboock skin is that
Preety bad dare for a day? How bout up it up grow guts nd go for a year.that would be real bet.
intro song name please?
Finally it is here. Marques take
Should I keep my macbook in ProMotion all the time or not? Will it affect my macbook long term if I do?


That goddamn notch


Can I charge my 2015 mcbook pro with this new MagSafe charger ?


when the magsafe is &quot;safer&quot;plugged in than the usb c cable, whats the point of magsafe again????


Hah. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a> “top notch design”…. smooth. 😏


Damn!!! That Intro❤️🔥


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m05s">18:05</a> that&#39;s how I know I found the right church.  When people continually use his name as a swear word.  You never hear anyone say mohammed at times like these.


Socks and Sandals all day everyday FTW!!! Kicking that at home gear hardcore.


I reckon they&#39;ve made the notch that large and wide so that you can stick a slider cover for the webcam without it impeding the usable screen space.


Now I know what in the box


Apple design is the worst


Will wait until next year. I can&#39;t wait to see you in Linus style socks and sandals.


CLIP IT CLIP IT, ALL OF YOU KNOW WHAT PART I’M TALKING ABOUT
Who makes intros for this guy ?Evry video got it own intro


I edited 5 videos in one day after I got this. Crazy how it truly replaces my tower for all tasks besides gaming. That soothed the pain in my wallet a bit and quelled all buyers remorse.

































<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m58s">3:58</a> the color is different because contrast is awesome


Can&#39;t wait to buy the 16&quot; to primarily watch youtube/netflix in my bed
When marquez says BUT ! BUT .. xd it&#39;s funny
Upgrading my 15&quot; MBP 2015 to 16&quot; MBP M1 Max, can&#39;t wait for the difference :D
All this is missing is proper Linux support. Once that happens, we&#39;ll have a perfect laptop.


Those laptops are TOP NOTCH design 🤣
Can you do a video dedicated to Logic Pro and Audio Processing on the M1 , M1Pro and M1Max ? As someone working in the music industry, I can say that most musicians and Producers use Multisample Plug-ins .For example when I play live I use Omnisphare, Keyscape and  Spitfire. Some of these can max your CPU out and they can sometimes take over  2 minutes to load all the samples.


It&#39;s Good Experience your video bro ✌️


Next: Apple Watch with notch


You know it&#39;s a true Pro device when you don&#39;t even have to mention the price.


I liked the M1 Pro, but Max is following the same price model where price over performance won&#39;t beat PC. For 5k you can get 2 3080 Ti&#39;s and build the rest of the PC again.


Still useless for CAD and database work though. :/
Hey, was it truly a review ? Watched the whole 23min in 4K From my pov, it&#39;s more like an overview. I&#39;m writing this because we can clearly see a trend with the YouTubers pushing content for pushing content atm, no true value in the copywriting and content itself. I just hope that you Marques and the team will keep a clear eye on this.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a> top-notch design 🤣🤣🤣


All those professionals who spent $50k on Mac Pro and $700 on wheels, are really upset right now

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m23s">16:23</a> &quot;Of course the M1 Max only has 64GB of RAM...&quot;<br>Tech evolution is unreal. 64GB of RAM can nowadays be considered a bottleneck. Let that sink in. 64GB of RAM. On a laptop.




I can&#39;t stand the mismatched color of the magsafe connector.
Hearing Marques say Jesus for the first time ever pretty much summarize apple&#39;s new chips.
I wish my job would allow me buy my own device. This would be such an easy purchase especially since I much prefer Mac OS over Windows anyway.
old magsafe wasn&#39;t built very rugged so I hope this has been improved upon
Calling 64GB ram &quot;only&quot; is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m00s">18:00</a> That look!
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m05s">17:05</a> you put “M1 Pro twice  instead of putting. M1 Max in the Final Cut Pro export stats

MA 15 iphonebook pro max
No gaming performance review?


I find myself waiting for MKBHD reviews as if I was waiting for next episode of my favorite series 🤣🤣<br><br>MKBHD saying “NEXT LEVEL” is the end point of my quest:  sublimated the personal computer tech world with these new M1 Pro and Max. Well done!


Socks and sandals ftw


MKBHD: Top Notch Design.... Get it ? 😅


finally, MKBHD uploaded an m1 max MacBook pro review<br>finally!!!!


Finally it here aaaaaaahhhhhhhh





I&#39;m betting they&#39;re gonna improve the ports on the next model and patting themselves on the back for it. <br>(I actually really like what they&#39;ve done with this)

Once the imac pro with m1 chips arrive, watch him lug that thing instead of a laptop again. I&#39;m calling it now

why would not they make the menu bar same height to the notch height




Awesome review as always!




So like what’s going to happen to the retired iMac Pro?





One sore thing about that otherwise amazing intro. Did not like the 0 cutting in at Apple&#39;s logo. It would have been nice to have the 0 engulf the Apple Logo and 21 can be pushed further aside. Still, it was a great intro but just sharing my thoughts.
“A new ‘top notch’ design.” 😏
Mac Pro will probably be a bunch of max chips
This video is a masterpiece. Watching it for a second time now

I wonder how a console powered by the M1 Max chip would compared to the new Xbox Series X / PS5 consoles we have.  I hope Apple take Apple Arcade a bit more seriously - gaming is becoming more and more popular worldwide, and Apple really need to get into this industry.






&quot;New top notch design...&quot; pun intended? 🤣




can i have one of those mac book pro m1 max?

Did any of your team test the 3D space? Unreal, blender, Houdini? I would love to know how these machines work with these apps before I pull the trigger on buying!

I am very interested to see how Microsoft and Intel make those commercials featuring these now, They gotta get <b>real</b> creative now.

The Apple reviewing team that has been checking and resolving on each product line has reached the macboock, next stop the deskstop.

Btw, I think the reason the notch is that specific size is because they plan on integrating Face ID in future models, and by that time everyone will already be used to the notch, and third-party software will already be familiar with it from a development and UI perspective.  So for now, it&#39;s probably more of a placeholder for future upgrades.


Wait? You cannot set the refresh rate on 120hz on all times? Are you forced to have it set on adaptive?

Cant wait for my M1 Max MacBook Max Pro BookMax Pro Max Bookmac to arrive

Apple listened to all the people who wanted ports and didn’t like the touchbar!

M1 Pro is the one for me, I don&#39;t need that graphical horsepower, the only thing I want is to compile code faster.


Fucking roasted Linus 🔥🔥🔥🔥

Didn’t watch any other reviews and waited for this one😌because if MKBHD didn’t review it, it wasn’t reviewed right.

Marques: Thanks for posting the review. I’m hitting refresh on your channel since that Monday when the embargo was done. Now I can finally rest.
Samsung left the group

Nice. Thank you. You don’t have to say “Jesus” in the video. Not nice for me as a Christian 🤝
Worthless Intel in crying mode ;-)
Thanks for sharing your opinions in an easy to understand and entertaining as well as aesthetically pleasing format.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m01s">7:01</a> Is that the laptop making the sounds?! Sounds like cheap plastic housing when you push it🤔
I was actually interested in hearing whether adding extra RAM is worth it, but as expected it was just another YouTuber review on how well it can edit and export videos.


Got 3 from Costco and they are fast computer. Not sure if it is for everyone but definitely built for heavy editing and graphic users. For daily use like personal or student I would recommend the Air. Since it is a bit lighter and thinner

Hate the hdmi port if any port rj45 10g. I hoped everyone would adopt usb c for displays... That&#39;s over know I guess





I love what they did there to the enhancements, even though I really hate that they took out the Touch Bar as well as I don&#39;t really like the bulky outward design. I got the M1 MBP back in February or so and I&#39;m super satisfied, because it&#39;s just enough for my tasks of producing music and editing very simple videos with some color grading... I know, the example lacks depth, but when my old laptop needed real-time to render an audiofile, the MBP need 4 seconds... 4 SECONDS !!! WTF<br>So as tempted as I would be to upgrade, I just don&#39;t need it at this particular moment and I think the M1 I got will be sufficient for at least the next 2-3 years, even though I know of some people that worked with MB as old as 2012... so much for a lifespan...
Did he say he has 768 GB of RAM on his mac pro? 👀 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m22s">16:22</a>




🔥🔥

<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m22s">1:22</a></b>  thats a reference towards what dev2d said 😂

Ethernet with MagSafe?





The M1 Max MacBook Pro is the Tesla Model S Plaid of laptops.





Great!






Nice touch with the android phone, but resistance is futile. You will be assimilated. These Mac Books are hard to resist.





would be nice to see some pricing.... yeahhhh i know i can check them on other websites....

I&#39;ve heard that even Ubuntu running in parallels is way faster than native on Intel. It&#39;s this for real?

outperforming the 3080 or 3070?





Looking forward to a potentially full-on Linus Sebastian cosplay when the MacBook Pro is updated xD


Whats above the Camera? You keep looking about the camera 😬





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m40s">17:40</a> I haven&#39;t had apple for years, can&#39;t believe they bought back the green milk bottle




As much as I love the addition of Mag Safe, my M1 Pro literally lasts like a week and takes so little time to charge I have to keep an eye on it so I don’t leave it charging so I feel like it matters a whole lot less now days.









I&#39;ve been having the audio waveform issue too. I didn&#39;t have this issue on my M1 MBP 13&quot; in the previous version of FCP. So I have a feeling it&#39;s a FCP issue, not an issue with these new Macs.











As an software engineer I am glad these machines are back in the form from a couple of years back. Yeah, they are beefy in size. But man, this is amazing. It is workhorse in your backpack. That amount of ram is quite useful for me. I don&#39;t need the M1 Max luckily, my compile times are mostly aimed at cpu. All those ports. They are expensive. Totally worth the penny.





I’m truly interested in these but the only thing I’m not sure would still work is gaming. I don’t game much at all, but occasionally still play GTA 4 and 5 which my current Macbook with base graphics runs fine at 60 fps in Bootcamp. I do use Parallels as well, but I assume it’s not made for games like these.<br>But would love to experience their energy efficiency, my current one is so power hungry, especially when it switches to dedicated graphics. It’s legit way worse than my 2014 13” with integrated graphics.
Who still miss those Light-up Logo




Man those intros are getting better




I am begging you to wear socks and sandals.





And we have a MB review woohoo!!




Love watching Things i cant afford





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=10m50s">10:50</a> by any chance did they reuse 11 pro Max&#39;s notch hardware on the laptop?
But will it fit in the Peak Design backpack?





Why you haven&#39;t reviewed vivo X70 pro+???
<a href="about:invalid#zCSafez"></a>

WAITING FOR THIS FELT LIKE A YEAR!

you are the best

FINALLY!

How many takes before you could say &quot;top notch design&quot; without laughing?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m23s">12:23</a> just leaving this for the future


Linus fashion tips anyone

768GB RAM...OMG xD

760GB RAM ??? 😅😅


LAN over the Power Brick won&#39;t work with the MagSafe cable, you&#39;d have to use a USB-C to USB-C cable and loose the feature of the faster charging.

Mac nl gaming

Well that was worth waiting for. 👌👏👍

&quot;ONE LESS DONGLE&quot; 😂

What skin have you installed on the MacBook ? Looks dope

imagine putting a sticker on the back of a 4000dollar laptop. lose the dbrand ad..

Thick as shit, gg apple, what was wrong with buying a dongle for all the ports? Feels like 2009 with that thickness :)))  And what about that notch on a laptop? lmfao      Hello DELL XPS

“Only 64 gigs of ram”. Me with 8gb 🤧

THE REVIEW!!!!!!!

Is there some kind of Microsoft Patent on Face detection unlocking on laptops ?

You can really tell the advancement in technology by how the ports have returned


You can’t have Ethernet on mag safe though?


Is the 24inch iMac going to have the new M1 pro/max anytime soon ?


The new Mac&#39;s are all amazing. I currently have a M1 air which is the lowest of the low and it is super fast. But Apple trying to push us away from regular USB is annoying. We all have regular USB devices and it is pretty frustrating with this dongle stuff. I know we all know this. But it is disappointing that these ports are not on the high end machines.


My beautiful blonde wife wants to buy an iPhone 13 Pro Max.


Wat do u mean by next level ? Wat abt the M1 the previous version do u want me to throw dem ?🥳


real name of the video, Truly back to level 🤣🤣


Hey Marques, great video man! I am a uni student, typically use the laptop daily and on a normal basis, as the internet, essays, uni stuff, and lightroom. And, a matter of fact, I sold my Dell XPS 13 2018, and switching to macbook, so which MacBook do you reckon? MacBook 13&#39;&#39;INCH PRO M1 2020, OR MACBOOK 14&#39;&#39;INCH M1 PRO BASE MODEL? i do not have heaps of money but am willing to spend if it&#39;s worth the upgrade. Any suggestion is appreciated.


Am I alone in thinking they should be called “MacBook Air”, “MacBook”, “MacBook Pro”’ and “MacBook Max”?


I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of dongle manufacturers suddenly cried out in terror and were silenced.


Great review 10/10


not TOP NOTCH design 💀💀💀


What kind of next level? Design from 2014 notch from iphone 10 and hdmi in 2021 no way. Where is touch bar , where is that slim design ? :((


he used to grind like that for times like this 🤣


Where are the people who were mocking apple? hm? Yeah you people get ready to have your windows PCs go arm... and be 5-6 years behind apple. Fun times. Dont forget to mock the notch people and focus reeeally hard on that ;)


Also, besides the hours we save, we also avoid dead moments waiting for a build/export/process during which the mind wanders and you lose concentration.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m06s">17:06</a> the bottom one should be M1 Max MBP


Nothing that has top notch design has a top notch in it&#39;s screen.
Didn&#39;t think HDMI was that crucial now that many displays support USB-C and others have display port.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m52s">3:52</a> did you guys forget to grade this shot? It looks LOG compared to the shot before it
This is the happiest he&#39;s ever been reviewing an Apple product. And one of the happiest reviews from him in general
&quot;Top notch design&quot;😩 that a marqes 😂
Groot!
Superb
Great review.<br><br>I didn&#39;t know that I wanted one before watching this. <br><br>(I won&#39;t be getting one, but I will be wishing that I was.)
Let&#39;s celebrate, HDMI port is back. With mac something very basic is worth celebrating
Dude your jub is a bit meta<br>You use tools to talk about the tools and how you review tools with them
This is very ugly. And that NOTCH is nonsensicality on display. Apple should innovate and come up with a new design. nothing new,
Did he say 768gb of RAM?!
Working towards mine! Absolutely killer machine. And now it has the MKBHD stamp of approval. So excited to cop this thing! 👀👀🔥🔥💻
&quot;Think of it as cutting into the extra screen you didn&#39;t have before&quot;.... Who you trying to convince? The notch is ugly, intrusive and apparently, almost completely unnecessary. Its just more belligerent behavior from Apple and its ok to say that, even if the notch is easily ignored during day to day use.
I am on the next level
so this is 2021 right? Sitting here with my mid 2013 macbook air with magsafe, SD-card slot, headphone jack,thunderbolt and feeling pretty confused.
max or pro are the best? fuck im so confused i will buy something less confusing, maybe pro max
Ok, if you insist, I’ll take the iMac out of your hands.
Pixel 6🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 gonna get me one
Can’t wait to see the 64 core M1 Pro Max chip on the iMac Pro Max
I feel like at this point Marques is so rich that his reviews are really hard to relate to. 768 Gb Ram? Why tf would you need that much? “Which MacBook I’ll be getting personally?” - let me guess, the most expensive one.


I have a 2011 MacBook Air, I don&#39;t have the money for a Max, it&#39;ll probably be a 14&quot; Pro
socks and sandals it is
What&#39;s the font used in the back of MBP at the start?
I love this thing! Easily the best laptop out there
Bruh, what does he need 700GB of RAM for ?
I absolutely hate the new MacbookPro.<br>From all the reviews on YT, @mkbhd is the only one i wanted to hear the opinion from.<br>I think Apple doesn&#39;t sell iPhone Pro&#39;s to Pro&#39;s.. The majority only buys it because it looks good and to stand out. They(We) trust the quality of Apple, building a Phone, Tablet or Laptop that would maintain a couple of years. <br>So let&#39;s get to the Macbook Pro:<br>The notch is absolute ridiculous.. justifying a whole notch for a tiny camera is insane, even if they &quot;upgraded&quot; it. If the rumors are true and the iPhone14Pro is going to get a HolePunch-Display, why not starting with the MacbookPro..<br>I have a 2017 Macbook Pro and i really wanted to upgrade this year.. but how tf did the macbook get this thick?  There is a difference between iPhone Users ans Macbook users, but i think even here the majority appreciated it, for being the best looking laptop. And for a portable laptop it needs to be as thin as the old one was. <br>Because whats the point of switching from Intel to their own silicon if you can&#39;t produce a laptop in the same casing as the old one.<br>Even if i love watching MKBHD. Everybody, even Apple needs to realize that he is a VideoProducer, not a regular client. So he needs a HDMI-, SD-Port daily.<br>I use mine daily for graphic design, so i don&#39;t really need those ports.<br>With the new M1 i could try and get a 2022 Macbook Air.. but if they keep their lineup the same and build a Macbook Air with white bezels, i won&#39;t buy it.. <br>I am going to wait for the Macbook Air till next year..And if i don&#39;t like it.. i have to buy the 2020(&#39;21) Macbook Pro with the M1.
Marques do you lift?


As far as geek bench goes, the M1 max is only on par with a 5600x...which is like the mid tier Ryzen CPU (if you even know CPU&#39;s, there are like 4 more above that).

unpopular opinion but i think the m1 macbook looks better than the m1 max macbooks because 1. the bezel looks better to me than the notch 2. a laptop is a portable pc. why should it be so big that you need a bigger backpack to carry it 💀
Why not just remote into another machine in the office instead of dragging an imac around.

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m16s">20:16</a> waiting when u do it for an iphone one day
MBP: I’m on the next ㄷ level ㄷ KOSSSMO….
“A new top notch design” nice
Unbelievable that Marques doesn&#39;t open up the machine and talk about fixability and upgradeability, nor does he talk about durability. How hard is it to change the battery when it no longer holds a charge? How hard is it to get a data off the SSD if the motherboard fails. These are the kind of issues I care about and the reviewers do a disservice by not covering them.

Still for a developer working with Docker, M1 are not recommended<br><br>I really hope improvements on this side
Apple are the masters of chip making. And their new miniLED screens are incredible. Next level.
Boring display cost is too high where is amoled display?
Yes the notch DOES interfere. When I zoom the display because of my poor eyesight it hides critical Menu Bar items.

Now just thinking that when Apple will come in Gaming industry..
Did Apple forget to make it touch screen?
Only if a samsung book was as Powerful!
Fcking shit, need money for new MacBook Pro <br>:(
what are you going to do with the Mac Pro
Would you consider doing a like product of the year awards like you do for smart phones but like over all tech? <br>Categories like <br>Biggest leap forward <br>Best in class <br>Biggest flop<br>Best budget device
&quot;They have a new top notch design&quot; - yes, we all saw that new and ugly notch on top of the screen 🤭<br>PS: Nice new Android daily driver Marques!
Thank you so much for the complete honesty. I do love these Macs but to be honest I&#39;m perfectly happy with my M1 from last year. It never had any kind of problems, the battery still lasts forever and runs all my workflows flawlessly. I&#39;ll keep it, for now, will delay the upgrade. I think I might eventually upgrade to the 16&quot; m1 max when it drops in price a little bit, maybe refurbished, it&#39;s def too much just for a &quot;nice to have&quot;.
Why is ever review I&#39;m watching of these things rating the HDMI port as &quot;ok, in a pinch&quot; because of it being HDMI 2.0 and not 2.1? I get the price argument, but how many times have you needed to connect to a display that is really more than 4K60hz? It&#39;s a bit unrealistic for the every day person.
Well it&#39;s about time...
I have been thinking these MacBook Pros have felt eerily familiar and I just recalled why: the old HP Envy laptop!
Apple gives you HDMI 2.0 and UHC2 so that next year they can upgrade the laptop to HDMI 2.1 and UHC3 and call it &quot;revolutionary&quot;.
I guess you really should’ve discussed How Apple used to advertise USB C and touch bar and claiming they are “moving the industry forward” by removing the ports, and now all of a sudden they brought back everything they removed and we should be grateful ?! <br>What we learn here is that All of these are marketing moves just to sell products and companies like Apple are never on user’s side and they’re just playing with customers with words like “courage” to do new stuff.<br>Unfortunately in many instances the reviewers community don’t criticize these Apple policies and act just as another advertising branch for the company.
Far out... this blows my mind... urgh... I need :S
Is it next level though?
Forget the mac, the panda colour on the 6 pro looks amazing.
Intel is shaking
I&#39;ve been recording and mixing audio, editing video, and streaming to my classes with my 2012 unibody MBP 15&quot; for the past 9 years. The 2012-2015 retina MBPs were not that much of an improvement in horsepower, and the 2016-2020 touchbar MBPs were simply pathetic. These M1 MBPs are the quantum leap I was waiting for. My 2012 MBP GPU finally died today after years of daily abuse and high temps (but never a thermal shutdown, mind you). CALLING APPLE PHILIPPINES! TAKE MY MONEY NOW!
How is the charger slower over USB-C vs magsafe?
Finally :)
Tell me where did you get the Groot
for sure after some apple technicians saw this video, new adapter for macbook will be reveal
truly 2k
Sad but I would not be able to use up 10% of its computing power. Do not need it.
Honestly making me think about getting final cut for that new Z9 8k Prores RAW.
Everyone talking about the Apple Pro desktop with these chips. Will Apple produce a bigger version of the M1 iMac? I don&#39;t necessarily want all the power of a Mac Pro - I just want an M1 (or later version of the chip) iMac with a bigger screen than 24 inches. Does anyone have a thought that Apple will do this?
Apple supremacy!
Wait a sec ... is that a ... NOTCH? D:
Oh god… dude uses an imac as a laptop for travel… 0 respect now for you..
When &quot;TopNotch&quot; design is litteral lol
These truly just seem more for &#39;pros&#39; more - big video editors, programmers, whatever.  I think more laymen and everyday people will find this level unnecessary
Goosebumps!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m54s">12:54</a>
Me: Where do your notebook excel?<br>Apple: Yes
Can’t believe i just finished watching 22 minutes video of a MacBook that i will never buy 🥴😅

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=10m54s">10:54</a>
This is interesting to know even if i cant afford it at all
12 out of your last 20 uploads are related to Apple. Don&#39;t you think you are a bit tending towards a particular brand instead of being neutral for a tech reviewer.
They finally saw the light and brought back the ports
It’s monstar
I could make good use of that retired iMac lol
The text overlay in the final cut pro export section has an error.<br>The last line says M1 Pro MBP when I think it should say M1 Max MBP<br><br>Which is funny because I can totally see this happen with all the Pro, Mac, Max and Pro Max happening in their naming schemes^^.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=11m13s">11:13</a> i was  wondering 😁
This is promising. I haven&#39;t owned a Mac in about 6 years, and I want a new laptop. I don&#39;t want/need the MacBook Pro, but I do really want to see if/what they do with the MacBook Air. I&#39;m really hoping they actually release an updated version with slightly higher refresh rate and MAYBE follow the new iMac&#39;s colourways. I&#39;d LOVE a new MacBook Air in a selection of colours.
Did u see the douche pump cleaner
Ughhhh.  I finally want a MacBook again after 10 years.. but now they are 2 grand and I am big into gaming.. what do I do! 😭😭
And intel needs 235Watts at 90°C on 12th gen to reach this much power. 😪
Liked because of the &quot;top notch design&quot; comment

This might be the best review that I listened, ever. Thanks.

I was supposed to get mine yesterday but UPS “accidentally” put it on a different truck so I get mine today now 😂
top notch design 😉
Easy to travel with these heavy machines in as such compact size is incredible…..👌👌👌👌
Great review! Thanks. <br>Also Why the OS looks like an iphone?! Even the notch?!
just think about it. If you had a notch smaller than what it is, it would actually look a lot uglier and more disturbing than it is now.
Is this better then the Lenovo?
Unfortunately, the magsafe is not the same color as Macbook Pro in space grey color. Except, you buy the Macbook Pro in Silver color.
Merci à toi Marques
After the review, I&#39;ll wait for all the intel iMacs to end up in eBay and get one.
OMG - Where did you get that baby groot :)
Hope it’s ready for the MetaVerse 🦾🧑🏼‍💻
Great review - thx
Great review as always dude! 😀
No dongle! No dongle!
This macbook smoke everything
That notch is a deal breaker for me 😬
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> M1 Max* MBP
768gigs of ram!! 🙄
Was the &#39;top notch design&#39; pun, intended?! 😂
Still can’t play minecraft on it
Quality content!
Socks &amp; Sandals for a day, I save that
i5 12600k performed better than the M1 Max.<br>So I think x86 laptops might be great too.
No gaming test
How does it feel to have them.<br>(cause of that price tag) 😂
If only you could game on these suckers
Ok
You can tell that Apple pitched to all reviewers that &quot;these are tools&quot;
Fairly certain, that 10x more people, who never edited a single video in their life, than the actual &quot;creative professionals&quot;, will end up buying this device.

&#39;Only has 64GB of ram&#39;
I don&#39;t like this bullshit video - are you srsly think that RXT Card for exporting in Primier? How about Blender Cinema4D Zbrush Maya Arnold Redshift Octan Marmoset Nuke Houdini and other real soft what GPU is real for?????? Don&#39;t answer its slower then. laptop 3080 in 4 time and about 20-30% then etc 2060 mobile its about 1070 decstop  performance but without cuda/optix - RTX cores
Yup they’re incredible but is your bank account incredible? <br><br>(Asking the viewers)
SMH.. just buy a windows machine instead of luggin&#39; that overpriced piece of junk.. like seriously.. Also, you should state in your video if you&#39;re a paid shill or a unbiased reviewer.
he did the thing
So. If the new MBP beats the Mac Pro in final cut. It shall be interesting to see what kind of desktop CPU they will put in their Mac Pro in the future...
How do you entice developers to write code for an all new processor platform? Demolish the competition right off the bat. Good move Apple.
hey, how in the world will a magnet be stronger than type C ???????????????????<br>i dont mean to be rude but its common sense type c is much better than magnet much more faster and durable and stronger.
Nature wallpaper !! Major missing 😂
There is no way he didn&#39;t get paid to not shit all over the notch.
2021 glitch!
Imagine buying a desktop computer (without monitor) for $50k just a couple years ago that loses to a $4k laptop (on battery) today ! Damnnn that depreciation dude !

Hopefully they&#39;ll do one without the stupid notch.
Le normal people: editing after recording<br>Le marcus : @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=5m38s">5:38</a> editing while recording the same video.
Am I the only one or his last two videos looks weird?
I never had a macbook, but for all of the years of me using a windows I never used the function keys. I would assume that it is much more useful to have a freaking touch bar ngl.
My 2015 Macbook Pro overheated watching this video...
What version of Monterey are you using? in 12.0.1 I don&#39;t seems to have the Energy Mode option. Or maybe is only on the Max silicon?
Why is the video title M1 MAX only? You a comparing both pro and max no?
I want a M1 version of the regular MacBook, the ultra thin one
If you ever wanted to know what a good working environment is it’s sitting a MacBook on your old MacBook…
Gotta sell something worth more than my lungs to get this laptop 💀
In a pinch 🤷🏽‍♂️
Everyone after Dave 2D&#39;s review: &quot;Its great n all, but at the end of the day, they are just a tool&quot; 😂







They have to save some feature for future upgrades, since it looks like they have good too far with the performance, the next upgrade will be about the design. Otherwise it will be hard for apple to have an upgrade.
The quality of this review is levels above the others. Nice.


you should do a house tour!!!!!!!!!!!
Promise Me, You&#39;ll wear Socks and Sandals like Linus. I would love you to see that. 😂😂
I didn’t make it through the ads…..
I love the new MacBook
I’ve got an early 2012 MBP that has all these features minus the screen and keyboard…. 9 years Apple?
Let&#39;s wait another year...for socks and sandals 😂😅
I was stunned when you said 768GB of RAM. God level RAM 🙌🙌
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m11s">17:11</a> Dude u got the text wrong there in that frame..... it should be M1 Max MBP!!!
768gb ram DAMNN
Top notch design indeed!
Finally...
I am groot.....🤣🤣🤣
Finally the review I&#39;ve been waiting for
How&#39;s its touchscreen? Oh wait.
Jony Ive left apple and the design went to function
Finally
I realy am going to miss the touchbar. Wish they created both touchbar and no touchbar MacBooks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m26s">12:26</a> 😂🤣
Did he just say 700GB of ram?
Calling it a tool when there&#39;s cheaper more powerful options isn&#39;t really the truth. AMD RYZEN

King is back🙏🏾💯
The keyboard now looks like a cheap ho laptop
In your comparisons, you didn’t compare speeds to your travel iMac
i don’t know who noticed but i noticed it that you are using pixel 6 pro as your device 😅
Did I just hear that you have 768Gb of RAM in your Mac Pro? Bruh you got more system memory than some people have overall storage.
I am happy fro Marques, now he can travel light :D
Almost perfect. Id just like for them to have a touchscreen option as well.


I have a 16&quot; 64GB Max coming later this month.... cant wait
I assume there&#39;s a catch in all this like for every export it does they have to hand Hillary Clinton a baby and she leaves with it and they&#39;re not allowed to ask her anything
Congratulations on another big pay day from Apple 👏 👏 👏 <br><br>Markus Apple Shill Brownly
Apple has hit home run this time with this new laptop
&quot;Top notch design&quot;<br>😏 I see what you did there
Naah...I will wait for the 25% more thinner and 40% lighter model next year.
Awesome, but $5000 for a laptop!?? Yes you&#39;re getting a  lot of powerful features, but  In 2 years this laptop will be trumped by a new Mac!

Dope intro as always
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=00m12s">00:12</a> reminds me of the old MacBook pro, the plastic hard case one. Smooth curves.<br><br>Apple brought back the old iPhone 4 design and the old laptop design, thanking Steve jobs I guess.
&quot;I will wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus&quot;. Apple: hold my beer...
I have a question but can’t seem to find the answer online. Is there a huge difference between the entry line m1 pro which has 16gb of ram and the 32gb of ram one ? Because you also automatically jump from 512gb to 1tb of storage and it’s a huge price difference. Fyi I edit a lot of 4K 25i footage on premiere pro (rarely 6k but never 60i or more even 30i). Thanks a lot to the Guy that can help me with that !
FINALLY!
i liked the bigger notch better
Ethernet in the charger would be nice, but I can’t see it working with magsafe
I&#39;m not usually the type to say, &quot;use a PC&quot;, but when you&#39;re literally carrying what is dimensionally a large scale computer monitor with you...
U better wear socks and sandals if they dont add it lol
Apple has inadvertently crushed upgrade cycles for their laptops. Also the accessories market has been crushed with the addition of ports. We also lost the need to buy the wheels for Mac Pro and have to just settle for their microfiber cloth. Something doesn&#39;t seem to add up. Why Apple why? We always knew you were smart but we knew you were moneywise smart as well. So why?
I wish they had added USB-A port as well. Still have ton of cables, dongles, extrernal drives and peripherals that use the old USB-A ports.
Don&#39;t call them tools that often. It hurts them
Good job apple now make one for support techs / network engineers plse.
The audio is slightly out of sync from the video.
I wonder what they are going to do with the desktop version... 2x M1 Max, or 4x M1 Max... :o Or, maybe an EVEN BIGGER processor called the M1 Pro Max? :o
I like that baby Groot in the background
I don&#39;t need this but have a lot of money to spend and just want a nice laptop :) Ordered the maxed out 16 inch
well its GPU in 4 time slower then laptop 3080 and on 30% slower then rtx2060 laptop..... its around 1070-1080 in native aps
I tested my 2015 base model 13inc MacBook Pro vs my new 16inc MacBook Pro base model.  I rendered an hour worth of video. my old Mac took 8 hours to render. my new Mac took 15 minute!!!! it was a worthy upgrade.
He said these laptops have a new “top notch” design. I’m sure next year they’ll try and shrink how top notch it is.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=13m03s">13:03</a> no, it’s not a problem in my device 😯
This review was same as every other review on the planet, just a critique.<br>If you’re gonna take 2 weeks for a video at least have something different to offer and not waste time
Very good overall review!
Hey brother Gife me Ur best Phone 😂 I will be thankful to u 🤣
feels weird that you give a thumbs up to such an expensive device that has a port selection that isnt even high end its just alright.
To be fair the (2019) 28 Core Xeon from Intel basically uses an optimized Skylake architecture which came out in 2015. This was when Intel was stuck in the 14nm +++ cycle, letting all their competition catch up and surpass them. Comparing a SOC from 2021 to old technology is interesting, but people need to know the context.
I use windows pc and I&#39;m jealous. My Asus G14 is still really good and a bit cheaper but Apple just crushed it
me watching this on a 4year old MacBook air<br><br>u r of no use
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m39s">1:39</a> “top notch” design 😂
like linus 🤣
Not for me, at only 64gb off ram 🐏<br>Apple give us a real pro with crazy specs that only real rich people can afford it, thanks!
I need to know and be listening to this intro always
i use a 2015 macbook pro 128gb :C.....i use final cut, should i upgrade now or wait it out?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m35s">12:35</a> Lets see those socks in a year
I got my fully maxed out M1 Max 16&quot; MacBook Pro today.
Finally it’s out now I don’t have to check your twitter every five seconds for the announcement
Feels like I was waiting for the new episode of game of thrones
I think Marquez just wanted to proof that the best stand for a MacBook Pro 14 definitely is a MacBook Pro 16
What have they done to the keyboard light buttons?
Compiling the Linux kernel is a great benchmark. The regular benchmarks can be kinda inaccurate because we&#39;ve seen vendors ramp up the power limit over spec when running popular benchmarking programs...
orddered 3 top spec m1 max
damn thing doesn&#39;t support CUDA 😒😒😒😒
Can&#39;t believe you went through that
The review the internet was waiting for…
I think if i had unlimited money like Marques, I would choose a maxed out 14inch + an usb-c external display. It`s more screen realestate to edit, and a lighter, smaller machine to use when all that screen isnt necessary.<br>For someone who lugged around an imac pro, it would be a hell of a lot lighter.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m25s">16:25</a> M1 max only has 64gb of ram my Mac has 768😂😂
Whats the intro song? I can&#39;t find it on the channel of 20syl.
Time to finally change my mid 2012 MacBook Pro 😂
Summary of this video : MKBHD needs this MacBook in Matt black.<br>I know you thought how nice it will be :)
The bigger benefit with higher impedance headphone amp is more about the sound quality getting better when using high impedance headphones. The amp doesn&#39;t have to struggle as much.
&quot;Let&#39;s discuss this &#39;top-notch&#39; design&quot;... HY-larious!

Truly next level is the price: Overpriced
You forgot to tell us what wor the specs for inch computer the you test &quot;drive&#39;&#39; and presented in this video 📹
Coming to think about it, the notch design is a great opportunity for Bartender 4.
Waiting for that linus cosplay
All this power and programs like solidworks and catia don&#39;t even exist on macOS. Even autocad has less features in the macOS version.
why no usb port ,?
The ironic thing here is that, had Apple not gone on their quest for extreme thinness, the last 5 years of portable pro machines wouldn’t have been running so hot. <br><br>Sure, we can blame Intel somewhat for never delivering on promises made, but ultimately, it was Apple that chose form over function and I assume have paid a heavy price for that.<br><br>Another point of irony that shouldn’t be lost on anyone, is that the Pro and Max chips would have run perfectly fine in the chassis’s from last year. Proven with the 13 inch Air and Pro running M1, however, I don’t think we should have ever lost all ports in favour of USB-C, nor do I think anyone benefitted from the thinner design over something that could have housed more battery.<br><br>Let’s hope Apple have truly learned from this.
Yea...its not gonna be cheaper overall if you get similar experience on a specced out PC thats actually cheaper overall. Its only gonna be good for those who use apples own or mac only programs. Otherwise, dont waste your money on it. Its a very very specific computer. Apple is just a horrible firm by this stage, and i dont care how powerful it is, its still crap if it limits the users freedom in this internet and smart device based world. Its too inconvenient to use.
They changed the charging port again haahaha this is madness
Frdzzz please don’t fall for this paid channel videos… this is just for hype… please be patient and watch… there are lot of compatibility issues.. market software are not yet ready for m1.. please stand By.. i am a big fan of mac like many.. but after a long research have learned a lot. Please stand by and watch still the market fully accept this change..
Jesus has nothing to do with this 🙏😇
@Marques Brownlee Someone is pretending to be you to contact us.

Were now at the point where this review from MKBHD is just as hotly anticipated as the MacBook Pro itself 😂
15M soon!!💃<br>Congrats Marques....Make a Livestream please😅
&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day...like Linus&quot; Bwahahaha
Imma go and charge my iPhone with 196 watts power adapter.
I wonder how much the performance dips when using another operating system.

literally &quot;top notch design&quot;
I&#39;m getting 90% plus of gigabit speeds with the WiFi 6 on this new MB Pro 16&quot; so I&#39;m not missing the Ethernet.  You do have to get the $300-$500 WiFi 6 router to get those speeds though.
This laptop is not for regular Mac users… this has been focused for specific set of High config utility ppl only
&quot;if you have to ask, it probably doesn&#39;t apply to you&quot;<br>:(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m17s">7:17</a> - There is a new keyboard on these &#39;kncokBook&#39; pros
I saw that i9 12th gen is better than M1 max.
You The Best YouTuber ❤️
Well done. Superbly well produced, rich but accessibly and entertainingly presented content. A real benchmark for everyone else. Are you thinking of doing any still “nerdy” but less pure tech pieces? Such as within  the topic of our transition to a low-carbon economy? Anyway thanks, great stuff. Inspiring.
It&#39;s nice to see you actually use the pixel as your daily driver
Finally!
So, this device is good for Adobe rendering in H.264. Ok
Now I can connect my PS4 with the hdmi plug 🤣🤣😂😂
Thank you so much for being level headed and not a hysterical fanboi. i realise from what you have said i dont actually need one - but kind of want one anyway.... really wish it had a USB - A port as well
Great but I just want one of those mini-led screens on the MacBook Air and I’m good!
Since Marques is one of my favourite techtuber, I was waiting for this review. What I like the most about this is, that he is one of the few on this planet, who understand what the notch is all about. It&#39;s &quot;cutting into the extra display that you actually didn&#39;t have before&quot;. Thanks a lot for that and hopefully a couple of people will finally stop complaining about a not existing problem.







<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m32s">1:32</a> wtf i broke my screen or what!
Tech you tubers talk about video editing so much. 90% of the people who buy macs wont even have a video editing app on their mac.
how is no one pointing out that the notch in the MacBooks is different than the one in the iPhones? this notch looks more like the Google Pixel XL! why couldn&#39;t they have the notch shaped exactly like the iPhones&#39;?
I still think that my M1 is much better than this.
This Mac crushing the 50k Mac Pro and ppl be saying “it has a notch tho” 🤡
Don’t wear socks 🧦 with sandals, that’s fuccboi behavior &amp; you’re not a fuccboi.
Is the sound out of sync here?
you could carry small PC with 64core around that takes up way less space. Another problem that apple uses are creating for themself :D
But
Why having FaceID?  That is HUGE security problem. Also authorities can unlock your phone/mac with no legal consequences. Password is the ONLY privacy protection you have.
What a great review! Video quality is really pleasing and very good info package of those devices. I also admire the way you give the presentation like a normal down to earth guy without having any show mode on like some other famous tech youtubers have.
Is it just me or does MacBooks give you shocks while charging?
Hmmmm
Reading the export speed from a Pixel gave Tim Cook a little heart attack.
every type c / lightning had its own buss ... just curious how many pcie lane apple give to this monster arm cpu
Super expensive high end Macbook pro: doesn&#39;t have the latest and greatest :  MKBHD: &quot;Truly next level!&quot;<br>way under flagship price Google pixel 6: MKBHD &quot;aLmOst aMaZinG&quot;<br><br>But sure...MKBHD isn&#39;t a apple fanboy.
So… I ordered the 14 inches M1 pro 10 core model and imma just watch youtube and anime. 🙃
👍🏾🙏🏾
Imagine iPhone 14 Pro Max.. with a headphone jack! 😂 Yea.. never.
I&#39;m really curious to see how AMD, Intel, and even Nvidia are going to respond to this.


just curious.... m1 pro/ max just use lpddr ... we don&#39;t know it had limited memory bandwidth/ latency hold its performance under its power/thermal budget constraint .. just curious if apple give m1 an gddr 6 like an gpu who more power hungry and performance way better than lpddr on mobile ver ...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m23s">16:23</a> so the macbook has only 64 GB of RAM, compared to 768 GB of RAM, on the mac pro..... <br>that just sounds like something my mom would say, not knowing and throwing some familiar numbers around 😂😭<br>I&#39;d be like, &quot;noo, that&#39;s probably the SSD&quot; 😝🤣<br>But seriously, I wonder when the general public will be talking about like 1 TB of RAM, like it&#39;s nothing 🙃









<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=00h17m05s">00:17:05</a> should be M1 Max as the third option, not M1 Pro
“Truly the next level..”<br>See the notch..<br>Me:”Hell no. Will skip this generation. I’m out”


M1 is hendel 4K 60 fps video editing professional ?
Mistake at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m10s">17:10</a>? M1 Max completed the test in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>* not M1 Pro I presume?
Seems like you think they added ports that no one should use, headphone, sd card, hdmi adapters still needed
Finally
Amazing video! Can u please do a full video on how you use Final Cut Pro on the new Mac book pro ? (Maybe on the studio channel)
It&#39;s bit sad that buying Macbook Pro or iPad Pro is easiest way to get a good HDR monitor. I want miniled for PC!
Can it still charge via USB-C? I charge my laptop with a USB-C monitor and only use the charger for travel. MagSafe would be a step down for me.

Even after years of making CPU&#39;s it&#39;s funny why Intel can&#39;t make a CPU better than apple 😂😂😂, I think they should stop with this rubbish cise instructions set and just go with rise as a separate line and slowly all dev&#39;s will migrate thier apps to the new rise instruction set.
Apple: the Dongle Company
apart from the notch, this laptop is incredible. it looks obtrusive and doesn&#39;t give the sleek, minimalist professional laptop look that older gen macbook pro&#39;s did. it is a massive notch compared to what&#39;s in it. but the performance makes up for its ugly looks. even if i am a part of the PCMR i have to give props where its due.
I wish I had a reason to get one of these
I have the base 14&quot; mode ( had the 2018 MBP)l, doing some light editing in Premiere for some webinar takes no time now, the export went from 30 min to 8, photoshop is opening in 2sec vs 20 and files with tons of layers and artborads are now easy to deal with, same for InDesign and after effects.<br><br>And it&#39;s silent, I haven&#39;t liked an Apple Laptop since my 2012 MBP, it reminds me of the jump in performance we had with the titanium where suddenly everything was smooth and easy<br><br>I&#39;m not regreting the purchase at all, and the notch is not an issue at all after 2 minutes






😳🤔💯
All MacPro users can feel ripped of now.
I am not a Mac user, and I want that hardware...
Small notch would be uglier, that&#39;s why it&#39;s large
How did you get this  black and white Pixel 6???????
Thanks for the Timestamps
But the notch, and how poorly they deal with it... it is a miserable joke, like the charging port of magic mouse. And I already see other companies doing the F&amp;$%ING NOTCH, in laptops or external screens, the nightmare of the future after this BS. And to be fair in next year update there will be FaceID up there it is this size not without the reason, right? Or someone just loses the mind. But maybe it is because I HATE full-screen mode when working.
looks like Marques got inspired by dave3d &#39;s videos since he started to use the sentence  &quot;this is a tool&quot;  :)
Did he say 768 gigs of ram?<br>Geeeeeesh!
I feel like the only person the notch doesn’t bother lol 😅🤷🏼‍♂️ it’s so out of the way for me lol I doubt I’d notice it or care much. I am planning on buying one of these soon as well 🥳<br>But yeah WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THE MAC PRO DESKTOP ABOUT TO DO!? The power that that thing will have is going to be insane lol
tetra my beloved
all youtubers about this laptop: &quot;it&#39;s a laptop for youtubers&quot;<br>does &quot;professional&quot; mean &quot;media professional&quot; now?<br>What about engineers, developers, research etc?

Marques will still carry that luggage because of iMac M1 Max
Honestly, I have no use for the higher end Macs. I&#39;m perfectly content with my M1 Air as a writer.<br><br>But it&#39;s safe to say that Apple made the right decision by transitioning to their own silicon. The performance (and battery life, for long writing sessions) is insane. <br><br>(Even better, while on low-to-medium graphics, my wife can play Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 on her M1 Air with minimal thermal gains, and if you&#39;ve ever seen or know anything about that game, that&#39;s pretty crazy)




All I can say is... Thank you Apple, for waking up other tech companies... They usually tend to only copy things from Apple that would only give them more gain and always hold on to innovation or development... With this, I am looking forward to what AMD and Intel brings to the market. <br><br>Intel&#39;s 12 gen is already looking promising on desktops, but I expect to see real competition with their 13th gen or 14.. <br><br>Apple is ahead and I hope to see others wake up and try to copy this.. And not only copy raising of prices or ditching of chargers.. <br><br>Awesome review Marquez.. That 700GB RAM drop was insane.. None the less, these laptops have changed the wave of laptops and I&#39;ve been waiting for this for so long.. <br>Awesome crisp video

Been waiting for this video from Marques for quite some time!
Will you upgrade the MKBHD Studio to include the new M1 Max MacBook Pros? We need a vlog!
Glad to see the tech finally evolve to this point. The competition in CPU innovation is picking up the pace! Four companies fighting in ARM/x86 and big.LITTLE/monolitic CPU space, it will be crazy decade for mobile tech.
MKBHD sneaker game is strong... damn!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m16s">18:16</a> well it&#39;s no brainer you can retire that travel imac,  you can easily use 2015 macbook pro 13&quot; and get your videos in lesser time it took you to produce this one. :)
ROFL @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m24s">12:24</a>
i love marques but carrying the imac around was just plain stupid, is plenty of machines in a laptop form factor prior that was capabale, what an absolute hassle and waste
putting older ports is another clever way to let you buy overpriced dongles, change my mind.
Back in the top form. Amazing
"That Intro 
🔥🔥 🔥"
Mkbhd is slowly being a yes man for apple. Just a thought 🤔
Intel better step up its game.
All that power, and still cant play a simple AAA game, lol 😂


Docker still doesn&#39;t work properly on M1 :(
Agree that the lack of Ethernet-on-brick is definitely a miss.
Your Mac Pro has 768 GB of RAM?? damn..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m32s">12:32</a><br>I want Linus&#39; reaction on this
meanwhile @Linusontech cheering for 25% increase in intel 12 gen
Apple : buy our new mac book<br>Me : dude!! The notch<br>But seriously <br>Love the notch😍😍😍😍
The only professionals I&#39;d advise to be cautious with any M1 MacBook are software developers. Docker/virtualisation cannot be emulated by Rosetta and the early native support is still a bit sketchy. But that will get better over time. It truly look like a great machine.
Good to see stepping back gives that much love :)<br>Well for me M1 + 16GB are definitely enough, MBP&#39;s are so high on the level of performance I&#39;ve be glad to see 2 sizes of the new MBA&#39;s.
&quot;The mouse goes underneath it, for those who were wondering&quot;<br>.<br>I HAVE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT THAT THIS WHOLE TIME. Thanks Marques.
Intro game is on fire
Enjoyed the review. Thank you very much.
As someone who uses a webcam cover, I&#39;m happy that it now still fits there. If it was a hole punch etc., no way you anymore cover it up.
Honestly, every review of the MacBook measures the performance via video editing.
All this, but can it run Crysis?
can you review xperia pro-i
Reads apple stats on a Google phone. I👀u..





Great content as usual! I really liked the fact that you mentioned other good channels. Thanks





Awesome intro 👌🔊
So Apple really isn&#39;t thinking of taking out the notch in their devices. At least I know that I don&#39;t have to wait for next iPhones if they don&#39;t have a notch.




Finally! Apple is finally innovating for once. Haven&#39;t felt like this for Apple in a long time. Can&#39;t wait to see what else they bring into the market. Hopefully makes intel pick up their slack lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m55s">8:55</a> What is That icon next to the battery icon in the menubar?





Marques is maybe the best tech youtuber. He always dig deeper in every review and offers a lot of informations about the product. The only thing I complain is that most of his reviews are those high-range products and a lot of them are apple&#39;s. I hope he&#39;ll do more mid-range products. I&#39;m hoping he reviews the new Sony Xperia pro-i



Touch Bar is cool, just not in place of regular function keys...





Marques’s videos are ALWAYS HYPED!!!!




It&#39;s so exciting to really see Apple at their best again. They&#39;ve been declining a little bit, but this... this is a return to form. Stunning laptop.




This reminds me of my 17” MacBook Pro with the matte display! 😩 I miss that big beautiful beast!
&quot;My Mac Pro has 768 GB of RAM&quot;<br>My 120 GB SSD: <b>sadness</b>
You&#39;re making me feel guilty by keep saying &quot;it&#39;s a tool&quot;. I am retired and have just above average computer skills. I have edited movies in imovie but that&#39;s about it. I have never used or know how to use Final Cut Pro, BUT despite the above, I want to own one of these new Macbooks. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve placed an order for a Macbook Pro 10-Core CPU, 16-Core GPU, 16GB Unified Memory with 4TB of SSD Storage AND I don&#39;t feel guilty even though it&#39;s going to cost me over $4,500 and that I am not going to use it as a &quot;tool&quot;. I am justifying this purchase both to myself and my better half as an interesting and enjoyable way I can exercises my brain to help keep mentally sharp. Surely, I cannot be the only here who&#39;s not going to use my machine as a &quot;tool&quot; or am I?











Weirdly they&#39;re not actually thicker, it&#39;s an illusion from the shape change. I think they&#39;re actually thinnner.




HDMI 2.0, funny





Why are his intros always SO fire 🔥





768GB of RAM!<br>My man has more RAM than many people&#39;s hard disk capacity.
The power efficiency is the most insane part of these chips imo






Good Point.. Its a tool... Get it if you need it ...





I need one laptop but i dont have money 😞





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a> pleeeease let this happen! 😂




Macbook is my dream laptop I dont know when I&#39;m gonna have it. Hay
....





Can someone say me what 20syl song was the intro
&quot;I have M1 Max 64gb because I take advantage of those extra GPU cores&quot;<br><br>Noooo.. you have it because you CAN. The performance that comes along is just a bonus.





Top notch Jatt





Looks too tick, even more than it is
Unpopular opinion but bring back the Touchbar. And that notch is a crime against humanity.




hey Marques! A quick question, which software do you use to do the AR intros, etc?





Why doesn&#39;t Marques use the magnetic timeline? Sure this must have been answered somewhere allready?




<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m35s">16:35</a> good tricky ad for ggl cellphone !!




I could change the sd card reader and even the HDMI port to the ethernet on the power brick!!! It was really what I was expecting to surprise me, considering almost everything was expoiled before!

That notch, I&#39;m done 😂
No fans while editing Red raw footage ? Are you sure Apple shipped these laptops with fans ? May we need to buy them for a extra $29.99
Can‘t wait to get my M1 Pro 16 to replace my 2015 15‘ MBP. Hyped!
I&#39;ve been waiting for this one. I don&#39;t feel confortable using my 16 m1 pro until marques say it is worth it. 🤣
Huh? Would you look at that. Apple seems to actually have made some reasonable choices for once. That&#39;s not something you see everyday... Or every decade
768 gb ram?!!!!!
All the ports but none of the ones everyone uses. That makes sense.
Will the 14&quot; M1 Max have the same performance as the 16&quot; M1 Max?
Can I get the retired iMac? 😄
You have no idea how often I looked up your profile the last two weeks. Just for this damn video
Does anyone know where to get that Baby Groot tree? I mean specifically that one, not similar. I want it so much!
No pricing huh
Marques finally switches from S21 Ultra to Pixel 6 Pro👀
Why is there a 15 pro max box at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m38s">8:38</a>
We’ve been waiting patiently for this one! Banger intro as always 🙌
Damn that red pool table ❤️
I just saw the MBP yesterday in person and they were gorgeous. I honesty don&#39;t mind the notch.
Looks and sounds amazing!...  our animation studio has got a suite of ageing intel iMacs. We&#39;re holding firm for some shiny M1 Pro/Max iMacs.. bring on 2022.
Apple is going back to the future with their designs
Now I’m really curious about Linus reaction 😂🤣
Why you need to carry around an imac when you can just hire someone else to edit them?
The long  awaited review just completed in 10 seconds ☆☆☆☆[][]][][]4]][][[][]@
If mkbh uses this audio for the intro something big is coming.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m24s">4:24</a> hah you said &quot;ass fast&quot;<br>Anyway really like your review ;)
The notch though???
MKBHD APPROVES <br>✅
Where can i get that cute groot thing in the back at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=19m39s">19:39</a> ?😅😄
They’re using Vibranium shit yo!!
THE REVIEW IS THERE ! THIS IS BEST DAY OF MY LIFE !
It shows that it&#39;s good to focus on observing rather than rushing first to review, good job MKBHD.
sweet mother of fahk<br>I can finally compile Linux kernels on the go<br><br>This is the first time I&#39;ve ever considered a Mac as a daily driver. As soon as Asahi Linux drops, I might as well pull the trigger
For most people, I bet they&#39;re mostly using it to watch youtube and browse
The notch again... adios amigos➡️
Honestly, I wouldn&#39;t have mind a manually moving mechanical camera rather than that notch. I could just slide out a camera from underneath the display whenever i needed it. Privacy FTW! Design FTW! Easy! This display design sucks.  Otherwise, this is an amazing laptop.
les go!
There is so much interesting things happening with these generations of Apple machines, performance, silence, power efficiency; this new architecture seems miraculous; the only problem seems to be that you have to use Mac OS X.
13&quot; MB Air that came out was so amazing that made you feel you really don&#39;t need the MBP. I really can&#39;t wait for the next Air to come out and see how it turns out in compare to these beasts!



Top notch design 😂 I see what ya did there
RIP Travel iMac
Mac books are the best
that webcam is still pretty trash imo. it would have been cool if they used an iphone se front camera for the webcam
The notch... Steve Jobs is crying in heaven




Maxed mac pro is $50k





As a photographer and Lightroom editor, Windows is over. I currently work on a Surface Book and the only thing I would have missed moving to a MacBook would have been the pixel density of the display. Even this is no longer a concern, and everything else is an upgrade. What a time to be alive.





He said: ONLY 64 gb RAM ¡!!!!!!







One thing you forgot to mention: the new macbook pros only hit 1600 nits on hdr content. the rest of the time, they are 500 nits
Ethernet on a powerbrick with magsafe is a recipe for disaster. :)





Thumbs up for that Linus joke 😂
im sorry, its ugly
Funny how Apple have made the Macbook Pro&#39;s thicker again to include the ports 😂
Probably the first time the verge made a better, more in depth review than you
I am always watch your mobile, Macbook,  tab,  Air pods/ air buds,  review.
The NYC subway on the background is dope 👍
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m24s">12:24</a> mark his words for next year
Of course you should expect this level of performance from a $4k laptop. It still sucks that it&#39;s non upgradable.
Can you list the exact specs of both laptop you used?
Next level intrussion of privacy.
You answered all my concerns except for one (which you don’t do in your workflow). How much of a time difference is transcoding REDRAW 8k to 4k and 2k ProRes on the M1 Pro vs Max?

Bro love from &quot; Bangladesh 🇧🇩&quot;
768 GB of RAM? I don&#39;t even have that amount of storage 😂
The obsurd Apple Tax is strong with this one, apple sheep will still buy it.
Great review, too bad the OS is so subpar and frustrating to use.
An indication that the notch is here to stay

Exellent intro,,
Someone help me find these wallpapers 🥲
Can you pls do an accessory video for Macbook Pro? Thx.
One the most awaited review 😀
“I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day – like Linus” 😂



It ezzz what it ezzz
I have used Sennheiser 650 (300Ohm) with my 2013 macbook for years and I never ever crank it to full volume. What is this “real volume” you talk about? (Now I get there are other benefits to properly driving your cans, but volume has never been a problem for me. I always use a headphone amp when using headphones in logic and when the audio actually is important).
DE-ESSER!!!





The Top Notch design...<br><br><b>Pun</b> intended





when a top-notch laptop literally has a top notch




Shiny! Apple is very good at making many people spend way more money than before on things they don&#39;t actually know that they need.




15M subs lol. Went so fast





Stop looking up so many times. it&#39;s distracting




I read an article on this MacBook Pro just yesterday, on how it’s gaming performance was next to average when it was tested with games.

We&#39;ve all watched countless reviews but this is the review we&#39;ve all been waiting for.





But is it faster than my i5-4300u?





I&#39;M GROOT😛





Not including an ethernet port is just baffling and a deal breaker for me.





I never really wanted a Macbook as i had always used Windows but DAMN these and the M1 iPads have made me want to switch





Not including an ethernet port is just baffling and a deal breaker for me.





Considering the performance per watt of this thing compared to everything else on the market, I would say it’s next level regardless of your specific workload and workflow.
What is that nyc subway blinking map? 😍





Why didn&#39;t they get rid of the massive chin if they removed the name?



why is having all the connections that  everyone else already has so amazing because apple brought it back?  I don&#39;t get it.. why are you amazed by this... I can&#39;t wait till the compatibility issues start and hardware start becoming an issue.  Welcome to real apple... let&#39;s go back and pretend we are going forward.
Did thi n×g^@ just say &quot;$50,000&quot; for the maxed out Mac m1 Mac? the 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
<b>ig they want us to be confertable with the notch so they can put face id without increasing notch size so we won&#39;t complaint about big notch afterwords.</b>
I used 120w Xiaomi mi 11T charger too charge my macbook pro 2021 😎😉
If only they offered it in more colours...😣
Edit your next 3 videos with the M1 Max Macbook, this is a dare
Marques got aespa&#39;s Next Level stuck in my head now.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m25s">16:25</a><br> “M1 Max <b>ONLY</b> has 64 gigs of RAM versus my Mac Pro has 768 gigs of RAM”
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=5m18s">5:18</a> noise 😅😅
Yup!<br>It was worth the wait for this review. No need rushing like all the others reviewers… Nice one Marques.
Wait...so socks and sandals?! 🙂🤣
That notch is totally turning me off!
A low Power Mode Test would be nice
Top notch)
dude ethernet on the power brick would be so nice
Yep, a new step in apple&#39;s profit and the max they can so far make out of a shit laptop
Jony left, and they really slammed the door on his way out,  lol. We’re the Macbook team whispering at his leaving party saying ‘do you think we can get the ports back now he’s gone?!’

Love the mustached Android mascot in the background
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a> hah, TOP NOCH design…
The fact that an ARM-based chip with fewer cores (and some of them are efficiency cores) with essentially an iGPU and much much fewer RAM laptop beats the crap out of an x86-based chip, 28 high performance cores with afterburners and discrete GPU desktop for rendering the same video project, just show how clever the engineers at Apple are. I&#39;m not a huge fan of Apple, but man, infinite respect for the engineers.<br><br>Sure the scrubbing while editing had a little bit of hiccup... but so does the Mac Pro apparently, as shown in the Mac Pro review.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m32s">12:32</a> please do.
&quot;a lifestyle company&quot;, Intel 😂<br>Apple silicon is BOSS.
Thought you had a fly on the mac before the 2021 numbers showed up 😂
The price is , Truly Next Level
I shouldn&#39;t be watching videos of things I can&#39;t afford.
Great hardware. Too bad the OS is the worst and gaming is still unacceptable.
If this can run Nuke with 10,000 nodes, along with Blender running Cycles X and Maya, then I’ll have a new MacBook
For a change Apple should swap the MacBook team with the iPhone team. We need this level of improvements on iPhones as well!
imagine the next Mac Pro...
The NOTCH laptop. Awesome.))))))))) in 2021
The video probably everyone was waiting for
My M1Max 32 core will arrive soon!  Can’t wait









Man haven&#39;t seen a product get a truly strong Mkbhd recommendation in a looong time. Way to go Apple.
The notch needs to be that wide because otherwise, you might touch the display when opening the display by putting your finger in the recessed area of the chassis
Damn this intro man!! A better one than even Apple could have made!
like linus.. 🤣😂
top notch has 2 meanings here lol
this max ones are so THHHIICCCKKKK
Please be carefully with the words you use. Don’t use God’s name in vain. Out there
Did you say your Mac Pro had 768GB of ram???😂
Pls make a review about the mavic 3
It seems like apple improves hardware and then slowly let&#39;s there software make use of the features. <br><br>In this case they have added so much hardware power wise that it doesn&#39;t matter if the software isn&#39;t caught up. These are the most powerful laptops you can buy.
Wow!! Its just a dream to get a Macbook in this 3rd world country. I am using a 2GB Ram laptop here. But It will be helpful if I get this!!

Marques is getting greedy, this video is more than 22 mins long along with all his recent videos
I love your review style. Great video. Thank you.

Spotted Groot 😎😎😎
When topnotch design is literally &quot;topnotch&quot; design. 😂
Can i install win 11 on this?

&quot;Top notch design&quot; - I see what you did there.
It would have been a no-brainer if it was just a little cheaper, with a USB-A port and HDMI 2.1 port, along with Face ID :-(
FINALLY!!! =)<br>I was expecting your review!
Top notch design. I see what you did there.
watching only for intros......
I see black boxes🤔
I like apple laptops, the build quality the battery life etc however I just cant get over the hype that like every product from apple it is treated like it is space technology, while it is not. While it is very performance per power efficient it is not as powerful as a high level windows laptop with high level graphics card like rtx3080, but it still costs twice?
Are you interested in evaluating our products? DM me
Whoever is in charge of intro videos needs a significant raise.
For the first time ever I have actually been using a product before MKBHD but his review up...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a> Pro miswritten, that&#39;s MAX on the last one
To be honest, while I like the comeback of the SD card reader, I would gladly not have the HDMI and instead have the extra thunderbolt port.
HDMI2.0 is there because of bandwidth... you just don&#39;t have unlimited bandwidth on here. Apple removed a TB4 port for the SD slot and HDMI. HDMI2.1 would need about 48gbps to take full advantage while TB4 &quot;only&quot; has 40gbps.<br>That&#39;s why it&#39;s &quot;only&quot; HDMI2.0 with 4K60.<br><br>But I don&#39;t get the criticism at all. People act like this HDMI port only support like 1080p30. No. It&#39;s 4K60 which is just as much as 99% of TVs and monitors support anyway... AND if you REALLY need more - you still have 3 TB4 ports which is more than any other Laptop out there.
Man people! The notch is the MUSTACHE of Laptops. Get over it. 🥸😂
they made the notch this big to reduce the size next year as an improvement lol
if they step up every generation like this,  in couple of years we will be facing self producing and rendering laptops , or they finish the project while you re thinking.... dayyummmmm
Love the video and this thing is a beast, would love to see reviewers give more love to 3D modeling software<br>Fusion 360, Zbrush, blender.
i think for power users the Macbook Pro is really great, for me as student the M1 Macbook Air is perfect enough tho
Great Video as usual, would you do a video for the best MacBook to get based on the use of each individual ? Kind of a guide of which to buy depending on what you do. That would be great for all those who are not geek enough to make a choice themselves........ Peace !
I hope MacBooks are as powerful as a gaming computer
incredible🤔
The &quot;top notch&quot; design is the most controversial thing about these new Macbooks.
Lool that ain&#39;t a charging brick. That&#39;s a damn cinder block.
Its not more powerful than 3080
I think there&#39;s something that many people aren&#39;t talking about and that&#39;s the standard M1. This is good for the majority of people. The M1 Pro and Max does not replace the M1. Like if you&#39;re a software engineer you&#39;re still going to get fantastic performance from the M1. The only reason I&#39;d go for the M1 Pro is because I want a 16&quot; MBP. Unfortunately since my current 16&quot; MBP is only a year old, I&#39;ll be using it for a few more years, but I really despise how hot and loud that machine can get - RIP Intel.
What bout the weight
9.9/10 screen. That thing on top... It was notch&#39;supposed to happen
Not a complaint but rather an observation, with your new sound effects, each time that pop sound comes, it tricks me as if I clicked the touchscreen in my Ford, I watch (listen) while driving :)
just use pc :D
That notch i garbage or design. It’s abomination. Yes the notch does not cut into application you run. But the notch CUTS INTO THE SCREEN. it’s plain ugly.
Honestly wish I can afford it
Am I the only one who prefers Magsafe 1, due to not sticking so much (better for sofa and bed)?
1k Apple haters disliked this video. Next level. Next level.
The only person who can say they make back the cost of a laptop by saving on oversized baggage fees....
I think that adding a face ID to the notch would be highly risky. Someone could hack your laptop or trigger a software that uses the face ID to approve payments from you without you noticing. The fingerprint reader is much safer because it requires a physical action with intent.
I&#39;m  old. I once had a Tadpole laptop with a Sun SPARC CPU, and we needed a bunch of them to troubleshoot our embedded processing platforms (Motorola RISC, one of those chips by another name and cooling fan is likely in your fridge or washing machine) - it was running Solaris with CDE, and not only was it a credible desktop replacement (compared to Windows NT) It could run diagnostics at full speed on equipment in the field. Like... FULL SPEED, and you had a full hour of battery life to play with.  The new MacBooks remind me of that... Only they don&#39;t cost 30k in &#39;90s money, and have Mac OS instead of Solaris with CDE tack-welded on top.





Let&#39;s get real. The notch is disgusting. If my display is clipped, then let&#39;s call it a smaller screen. The under screen camera tech is already there. Please Apple, spend some those Billions of $$$$ hoarded in Dublin and improve this tech. Very disappointed.
Guess we have a Beats Fit Pro review to look forward to….mine are coming today.
waited for this <br>dont know how long 😂😂
That Android in the back got angrier as this video progressed.
of course there&#39;s no FaceID! That will be the &#39;best feature ever in a macbook&#39; next year
The notch  why though why 😩
What is this beautiful blinking electronic circuit at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m17s">1:17</a> on the left side? That looks cool.
About the notch. You can almost never please everyone, but in my case the whole &quot;extra&quot; space on top feels a bit probable annoyance, as I like to keep menubar hidden and I almost never use full screen mode. So if I want to continue with my current setup, I would probably have to use wallpaper that has black bar on the top. All in all, I still have to get this laptop, because it is so good for my use (software development).
Marques and his top notch puns...
Long time Windows user, I wish if Apple add support of Windows ARM via Boot camp. I&#39;ll definitely buy one of these machines.
Rob Braxman would beg to differ.
Ugly ugly notch...
Why don’t you release your videos in HDR?
I honestly never understood why they removed the ports, but I&#39;m glad to see them back Finally! Now, all I need is a larger iMac with this new chip, and all will be good again.
&quot;thats gonna be wild&quot; - Marques B.
Reason for no Face ID is anybody can get in front mac 💻 an charge up $ whatever because the recognition for accurate detection wouldn’t be stable . Next yr yes !
Another enemy for my wallet :/
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m25s">12:25</a> OK now I&#39;m waiting for the next MacBook Pro to NOT have FaceID but still have that big notch, so just Marques have to use socks and sandals.
Waving around the Pixel 6 there haha.  Noice
Yeah…gonna just keep rocking my 2009 MacBook Pro until it completely dies or they make it irrelevant.
mmm yes this is literally a &#39;top notch&#39; design by apple
Damn apple is on a roll this year
When the tech product is thicker that&#39;s absolutely fine as long as it&#39;s beneficial
but............Im waiting for the day it handles a AAA game at full resolution at maxed out GPU settings without a drop on FPS
The price is also next level👽☠
RJ45 connection on a magsafe doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. Imagine if the cord is accidentally removed, then you don&#39;t have internet connection immediately.
It&#39;s crazy. Obviously all content creators will love the new MacBooks. They are perfect for content creators but how many are out there compared to those who are watching this video for fun? :D I wonder if lots of peeps just want to buy something shiny and then use this tool for browsing and content consumption only :&#39;D
When laptop &gt; desktop, you know this is serious. <br>Now, editors have to upgrade their softwares to be Arm native. <br>And there is finally a possibility to play with a Mac. I hope some major AAA games will come in the future.








I&#39;m gonna get this!<br><br>Watching from a phone with 2GB ram 😂
Irfan junejo is going to buy it
I hope the next one doesn’t have FaceID so I we can see you as Linus!
I’m surprised Apple didn’t include power over Ethernet in that MagSafe charger.

i’m on the next level!
as long as that stupid notch is there, i don&#39;t care
well explained
By the way... They&#39;re only tools nothing more.... 👏👏
Marques should test out the XPS 15 if he wants to hear the best laptop speakers.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a><br>U wrote M1 Pro twice instead of M1 Max<br>but great videos as always.
Apple leave programmers out. On this new architecture we are not able to create virtual machines
when Apple mentioned .”what have we done.” in their MacBook commercial, it’s now that am getting the point. These are actually beasts. Sorry intel, save your money on those ads
Watching your vids in 4k is something else.
the mouse goes underneath it for those who are wondering😂😂😂😂

Waiting for this . thank You.
For the first time I have seen marques kissing 😂 😂

Idk man, I just might want to see you in socks and sandals like Linus. 🤔
There is only one problem with this video. No HDR.
I&#39;m starting a new job in January and my new boss was planning on ordering an Intel MacBook. I told him &quot;if you do that I quit right now&quot;, he ordered me the 16&quot; M1 Max now. I am happy.
Waiting on the Mac mini m1x pro max
Is the magnet on the magsafe too strong? Seemed that way in the Apple store in Bristol UK
I honestly don’t get the panic surrounding the notch. Everyone has gotten used to it on a tiny phone screen so the thought of it on a large screen would be a non issue. <br><br>Also I’m assuming they made it so big that when they do add FaceID it won’t seem like the notch doubled in size.
Brings the ports back but last generation, on 3000€ machine.
Thanks for not celebrating the ports too much. It&#39;s silly that they are praised the way they are. I would trade MagSafe for another Thunderbolt 4 any day though. Magsafe has only saved me once in over ten years. I agree they should have come with an HDMI 2.1. This machine will last for a decade and should have every port at the absolute newest version. HUGE CHARGING BRICK. Still less than half the size of the monstrous ones on any strong PC/windows Laptop. Ethernet on the brick would be great. I agree that this would be something Pros would want. Maybe that will be an option for a separate brick in the future. No facetime is also due to supply issues I hope. It will be super annoying next year when it is introduced. I don&#39;t know what is going on software-wise on the webcam, but it feels like they apply a soften and smooth out skin filter and that makes it look worse than other cameras. <br><br>My main beef with this update is that I don&#39;t need it, but still want it. And $6000 is a lot of money...
Yo mate, love your videos but the lenghts are getting longer by year, I am afraid with this trend, we will have to watch 3 hour reviews in couple of years :)
I was waited all way long for this one <br><br>And i didn&#39;t watch any other review of this Macbook, just to watch your review 🙂
Exactly how many times did he say &quot;But&quot; !!?
Wow just like my 2013 MacBook Pro
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m10s">17:10</a> it should say M1 Max MBP in the lowest row!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m07s">6:07</a> my whole thoughts on the port situation summarized 😂 up to 6100$ machine and comes with outdated connectivity not even Wi-Fi 6E or BT 5.2 🙄 but sheep still follow.
Me thinking i should buy this to edit my 720p video on it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m23s">16:23</a><br> <br>Nobody: <br><br>No one ever:<br><br>MKBHD: Of course M1 max only has 64 gbs of RAM, vs the Mac pro has 768 gbs of RAM
Wierd, I don&#39;t have the option to change the battery settings (high power, low power) on a m1 pro
OK, I&#39;m buying it now. 🔥<br>Waiting for your review Marques, before making a final decision.<br>Great video!
Now this is what I’ve been waiting for!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> a new TOP NOTCH design😂🤭😂😂🤭
What about comparison between last year M1 and this year M1 pro chip?
That SD is probably half size so you cant expand the memory of your Macbook. So you cant leave a memory card in there and it&#39;s always poking out so you have to take it out.<br>Typical apple, trying to get every penny out of your pockets.
As a die hard windows user, I&#39;m glad I opted for a MacBook Pro for my job when I graduate this semester. The technology packed in here is unreal, and I don&#39;t care who you are, but if this doesn&#39;t excite you... Well you&#39;re just lying to yourself.<br><br>I cannot wait to mess around with one of these!
This should&#39;ve been a dope tech review
Now that&#39;s a true blue tech review by MKBHD, you are a gadget saint bro!
so that&#39;s why it took this long, LOVE IT
The price itself is already On the next level. So I am not surprised about its performance. Any windows laptop that have that much price would virtually function the same
Finally a Macbook Pro 16 inch that doesn’t need me running a program to put the fans on Full Blast just not to get it chocking every 5 seconds. Good riddens of Intel crap
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=10m31s">10:31</a> The only reason: <b>brand recognition.</b> Apple wants people to recognise the Macbook Pro to stand out. And the notch is tragically the only way to stand out at a café of with hundreds writers having a latte

Wait 768gb of ram? Wtf
Marques, i think you would also be fine with the m1 pro, i would really like to see real life situations where your personal workload is quicker on a max than a pro, i mean not just one thing, i mean all your work. Because I assume your workload is not oriented only on video(I would expect about 30% tops seeing you are working with a team.)  Futhermore, you can edit very wel on the m1 pro and i dont know how many external monitors you need. I&#39;m just genuinely curious who benefits from this other than people doing heavy 3D? would like to see a video justifying your cpu choice in a use case comparisson :)
damn bro you&#39;re good!
Wait ... so actually there are so many out there applausing for these bloodsucking craps @@<br>Dont get me wrong, but come on ... what benchmark means when a 2021 &quot;product&quot; vs 2018 9th generation chip with obsolete budget radeon amd @@<br>Not denying they do significantly improving work on their chip though, please hang on sec and look the &quot;esthetic&quot; notch, why ... kill few ports and put back on later ... get a &quot;glitchy&quot; touch bar, and kill later  ... better refresh rate but, than who (220hz is the base currently) ...then apple cloth, 1000$ stand ... not mentioning how frustrating for rediculously unneccesary strict compatility, to require buy all the complementary product and that does not improve for decade.<br>There are so much more when speaking of their phone making recently<br>Majority of people around me are averagely spending $4000 each year just to live up with the &quot;new feature&quot; from Apple.

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m05s">17:05</a> did you put the correct spec on the screen?
If Marques approved, they really should be next level..
&quot;The display on these MacBooks is top notch&quot;<br><br>Quite literally




My god someone actually mentioned musicians. Thanks MKBHD!
How come mkbhd delivers the same review without shouting and very little graphics and video transitions whilst other perhaps more tech minded youtubers don’t! Anyway looks like it it will be MacBook14 64 mb of ram max chip and 2tb hard drive for me… just need to find a buyer for a slightly used kidney!!! Cheers Apple n @mkbhd 🤣
I know it&#39;s very good but I just can&#39;t take it seriously with that notch. Their phones already need a new design and instead they decide to bring the same stupid design to their laptops as well. A lot of you are going to hate me for this but Apple started going downhill when Steve Jobs died and they are still selling so well only because of the name he built over the years.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m44s">0:44</a> my father in law is a designer. He always travels with an iMac, he never used a laptop or MacBook 💻. So he takes his iMac 🖥 in its original box. I never thought of such a case for him 🧐🤔

I&#39;m just genuinely happy to see that apple can admit mistakes and make adjustments...while making new ones.
As for the high impedance 3.5mm jack, sounds a bit weird of an inclusion. I CAN get <b>comfortable</b> volume from my phone and tablet, but the sound quality compares nothing to my dedicated DAC/AMP stack. If you want to just be able to listen to headphones from the jacks then why not but I’m 98% sure it’s not gonna sound as good or anywhere near even a cheap dedicated dac/amp





editing 8k resolution on 15 inch screen 🤦🤦🤦




<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=04m37s">04:37</a> ok king🥺

3 minutes and 49 seconds, <b>JESUS</b>




Never getting tired of the starting animations



Do you think they made the notch bigger to allow for people who use camera covers?


Is it just me or was he excited 😅


Just got mine ! 😌






All these and they can&#39;t even game, what a shame


Never knew how much I appreciated your reviews until I found myself refreshing this channel since the new MacBooks came out!! Awesome. Got the 16” max, can’t wait.


Ports are back !


thank you for the review. was waiting for this.


Awesome! I look forward to these kinds of laptops in maybe about 5+ years when my laptop might be due for an upgrade.


Luddites win! Instead of the harmonization and using USB-C cables for everything (I&#39;m speaking about USB screens, TVs, periferals, you name it), there&#39;s HDMI again. The only thing MacBook Pro REALLY lacked was card reader. Everything else should have been wiped.


Great review! Just one comment. You say there&#39;s no way that the camera hardware needed that much space to fit. Show me just one laptop in the market with thin bezels that packs a decent 1080p webcam. I&#39;ve search for it, and didn&#39;t find a single one. <br><br>So...I guess, at least by now, it really did needed that much space. Because no other brand has managed to do it.


Best laptop 2021??????



&quot;Like Linus&quot; hahahahaha


Finally!!! Let’s goo!!<br>That intro looking good still.



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a> -768 gigs of ram? Someone correct me if I heard something wrong.


Sick intro.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m16s">18:16</a> <b>Quick look to make sure the travel iMac didn’t get offended</b>


The battery sucks though compared to the M1 Pro because it has more CPU and GPU power. I canceled my 14” M1 Max for the 14” M1 Pro.


Nice review!
socks and sandals for a day haha. we won&#39;t forget
👍👍👍👍👍
THAT NOTCH IS SO UGLY!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Linus joke is golden. Looking forward for the socks and sandals 😂
what we have all been waiting for
This is the review I was waiting for.
The review we’ve all been waiting for
does anybody know where to get this LED subway sign on his desk?
Samshit and lagdriod fanboys are crying in the comment section.😂
Does Linus get to choose  the sandals and socks you will (have to) wear?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a> 768 GB RAM? really?
768GB.. RAM?! :o
If this isnt proof that apple removes features and then re-adds them again later on all for more profit... I don&#39;t know what is proof then...

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m13s">0:13</a>
Those beautiful eyes 🥰 who read this comment, may God bless them 🙏😊 and prolong the life of their parents 🙏❤🥰👍
They removed touch bar :(
Be a great man 💪 so that he can fulfill every desire of his parents ✌😊🥰❤
I was going to buy then I changed my mind but YEP I am buying again 😭
can we just appreciate this niggas editing work omg
Next Level video (as always)!
Those Intro shots were just too good.
It’s pronounced MaxBook Mac M1 Pro, I think you’ll find…
In the recording studio I worked in for 8 years, I would outsource a lot of vocal editing from our main machine (which was a Hackintosh) to my MacBook Pro. We ended up building our own headphone amplifiers to deal with the impedance issues. The fact that they added this feature is amazing!
I&#39;d love to jump over to Arm processors, but someone that is NOT Apple is going to make the switch. Linux itself is ready.
That is awesome! Thank you for a Great review Marques
Best computer ever...couldn&#39;t be better...gladly pay over sticker lol
Hey bro,<br>Big fan- and buying it soon seeing your confidence.<br><br>Does the benchmark scores vary if the charging is connected or not🤔 like in our Hp ones 🤪
Please tell the name of this intro track and not 20syl&#39;s YouTube channel
Anyone here just watch tech video for motivation, Because we can&#39;t buy it right know?
Please tell the name of this intro track and not 20syl&#39;s YouTube channel
so finally marques back onto pixel 🙃
Seems a decent buy, but I don&#39;t need a &#39;travel&#39; anything at the moment when I&#39;m not travelling.
Still for this price you can buy a much more powerfull windows pc, if power and speed is what well want. The good thing of m1 chip is power/efficiency ratio but it cant compete with ‘dedicated’ pro graphics cards.



If you don’t need your travel Mac, I’d be happy to look after it!!!😂
They should&#39;ve just put a bezel up top.
This one only has 64Gb RAM,  not really 768Gb RAM I’m used to 😳
Finally. The long awaited review. Thanks @MKBHD.
Retiring the traveling Imac sounds like a big move and big news for you! Nice to see a big techy guy so impressed and making such a change to your M.O. You must really like this new toy! I mean, tool. lol
I am Groot. 💟


Please tell the name of this intro track and not 20syl&#39;s YouTube channel
“Top notch design” 😂 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m43s">1:43</a>
FXCK Notch 🤬

I hope Marques stays grounded with the style of making videos over the past decade unlike some other therapy channels which have become boring ro watch😪
didn&#39;t even feel like 22 min of a vid , its so big yet compressed , thats why ur my fav tech youtuber of all time
I thought of beyerdynamic when he mentioned high impedence... lo and behold.. shows them in the next shot.. dt770
Happy Diwali ❤️
Did this man really say 768gb of RAM??
Maaire


I’ve been waiting for this review!
Ha the Reddit tweet regarding saving money is dependent on the staff moving onto other productive projects and not more candy crush time!
Ports is back. The courage to do the walk of shame!
I can&#39;t wait till mines finally comes in.
Can&#39;t believe you have been lugging around an Imac dude!!
Marques : <br>MacBook pro 16in can render a video in 3 minutes and 49 seconds 😀<br>Me :<br>My laptop can render videos in 3 hours and 49 minutes 🥲
I actually use the app that makes the menu bar black to hide the notch on my non-notched MacBook pro and it is great. the back menu bar looks way better than the colorful one
I bought 16” max.
Here I go again. Watching things I can&#39;t afford.
2027?


This shows how important optimisation is. Yes the macbook pro powerful, but in no way is it logically supposed to perform as good as desktops with insane CPUs and GPUs drawing more than double the power. Something needs to be done in terms of optimisation for devices using windows


Man am jealous of the people who actually know what to do with these top performance on a laptop, i would just be on youtube and chrome



I have been waiting for this bomb to drop for years, and for ONCE I can say Apple has reallly really really blown the lid off and made me want one for real! That said, for me it would just be a toy, I dont need the capability of it. And I dont have the greens to get one anyway! <br><br>But I have been hoping for ARM based monsters like this for many years now, its been pretty clear to me that this could be done.<br><br>Still a few dumb things with it but mostly minor things one can live with for sure, so very very well done Apple, think its something I&#39;ve never said before without reservation! xD<br><br>Meanwhile, Intel drop new CPU&#39;s more powerhungry than ever, &quot;ooh look we get moar FPSESS!&quot; while also consuming 250W!!!! There is no way they should be praised for that shit... but ofc they are. LTT had the best air cooler on the market on that thing and it still was at 90C... F that.








Next level presentation too; quick and exhaustive. And your play in front of the camera is getting so good. Kudos to you, such an inspiration.


That&#39;s some pro MAX review 👌

Just wish OS X wasn&#39;t painful to use 😢

The intro though…

Classic Apple:<br>Limits port selection due to space limitations...<br>But more than happy to bring back a proprietary connector that takes up 2-3 slots worth of space. Man do they love ripping people off $$$$

I can’t stop laughing at your tremendous iMac-case in the airport 🤣🤣
&quot;blabla it is better than last year a little bit blabla&quot; -when every new apple product release.
Your Intro team needs a raise.

So that&#39;s why you&#39;re always with that case lmao

I’m sure, you are waiting for this review.

Finally finally 😂🥺
But can it handle Google Chrome?

Like Linus HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Was waiting for your review. Just ordered the 16&quot; M1 Max 64Gb 2TB. Thanks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=19m12s">19:12</a> one of the most heartbreaking revelations for me today is learning that even android apps are developed on apple devices 😥
It&#39;s CRAZY how (unintentionally) biased this channel has become towards Apple. From the GREATEST VIDEO PRODUCER on YouTube to, just another Apple Sheep.
Haven’t bought a MacBook Pro since the Late 2013 model (it’s still working pretty good)…I’m buying this one for sure.
Too much biased
I&#39;d love a battery test at full brightness (sadly only 500 nits) for outside use.
I’m dying for mine to arrive! Interesting you had 2 space greys when the silver looks so good!













Intel just out of the conversation…

Watching it in my first iPhone


Probably put the notch in now so when/if they do eventually bring Face ID to the laptop’s, it won’t require another redesign, future proofing design.

hey marq, have you ever think of adding the review vids on different languages such as chinese of japanese, spanish and portugese? i bet you will gain allot more followers

&quot;Mom, I need this for online class&quot;
That performance is ridiculous! Going to be switching over from Windows soon for this
Man i am soo confused 🙆<br>If you edit all your videos also you collect all the data and research about the products then what does your team members do ?
U getting everything&#39;s to max
you take some fundamental things away from a laptop and then return it few years later, then the fundamental things becomes a feature. Ports, magsafe …… -_-
But that notch... No, just... NO. Also the computer looks primitive now, 2000&#39;s design, M1 was so so much nicer.
Darn#@! That intro was tight mate....! Too much

🔜 15’Millions Subscribers 🤝<br>Powerful Tech Reviewer 👏👏<br><br>Keep Growing 👉Keep Rocking 👍
“Let’s talk about the top notch design” 😂😂
where can I buy that Groot plant, anyone? :)
As I see the notch again in this video, I notice, that I have overlooked it in my first live test of the new Macbooks completely. And I find that not only pretty outstanding but interesting too. The Notch is often desrcribed as sth, that will definitely get ones attention. I now tend to think, that it&#39;s actually worked in so good, that it doesn&#39;t event got noticed by me. The all around appearance of the product, the way bigger apple logo, the really strong magnet of macsafe and the overall look and feel of the machines just sucked in my attention completely.
An 8K Professional Camera User Still Holds Up Fujifilm Instax Mini In Background. Hmm!
764gb of Ram on the IMac? Wut

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m43s">2:43</a> What is that dbrand skin?

Top notch design 😂😂😂😂😂

I don&#39;t have the money to buy an apple product but the tech&#39;s keep growing without even knowing im still wanting to buy an iphone 6s
Could you gift me your iMac Pro carrying case? I really need it, but can’t afford it :( 🙏🏽
The reason apple should’ve kept the Touch Bar: scroll through YouTube ads
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a> So linus wear socks 🧦 and sandals in your opinion ?  🤔<br>I don&#39;t think so Mac fanboy
It&#39;s almost like it&#39;s not thermally choking itself for the sake of thinness
RiP Intel
You should make a laptop of the year video this year
Finally!!!😫
Is nobody talking about the 768 gigs of ram?? I giggled when I heard you say that.
how slow was this review?
Naa ra gyud haha
I thought there was a fly crawling on the back of the screen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m17s">0:17</a>
Imagine not being able to get rid of the &quot;YouTube is now fullscreen&quot; dialogue notch
Embrace the notch, become one with the notch.
frisbee is more important than this
Winter is coming .. you too ?! 🤣🤣🤣
If it is a next level laptop, why does it have a notch in its screen?
Where will apple haters go now? 🤔😂😂
When the whole YouTube tech world has been awaiting for Marques Macbook Pro review.
with apple&#39;s shift to their own chips, it made me so happy. m1 was already a marvel and now this. i think they really nailed it with their &quot;pro&quot; macbooks. it is supposed to be for pros. if your workload is lighter but u still want the speed, then a macbook air would also be mooooooore than enough. now that they also come with their beautiful m1 chip
Any updates on the app compatibility?
Thank you for the review
Thanks for the detailed one, was waiting for this for soo long<br>Love it
It is the first notch in a laptop

I haven’t seen him this excited and happy lol 😂 😂😂😂😂
Finally bro, been waiting on this since 2019.
a laptop beat a whole desktop??? without being plugged into power??? jesus, apple just flexing at this point. 🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️🙆🏾‍♂️
<b>Marques is the definition of BIAS.</b><br>He spends years complaining that Apple products lack this or that but never complains in parts where it is vice versa. Also, when Apple does something by far better than anything else like in this case with display or with performance he can not force himself to outright say that the product is much better than any competition, he only compares to Apple&#39;s prior products.
Hope intel and amd learns from this and start to ace up their games... At least 30 to 40% of apples level development will do for us average consumers
If it is a next level laptop, why does it not have a touch screen?
I think they&#39;re preparing to bring back &quot;does more, costs less. It&#39;s that simple&quot;. Because where else would you find such power that is so efficient for the price.<br><br>Edit: in the context of productivity at least
Marques , if I heared you correctly . The ports are pro level but not pro at the same time 🤔. 😎🕶️🤏

Even thought its got the MagSafe back, can you still charge with the USB-C?
Obviously in a review there shouldn&#39;t be time to talk abotu that, but what&#39;s up with that IO update from appel. Did they make enough money with the ports they sold separately or are they intending to once again sell even more options (like cables) to the costumers to profit more of them?
Congrats 🎉 on influencer award!
I wonder how many of us have been eagerly waiting for MKBHD to release this video xD
Exporting for 4min costing 2% =3.3hr/charge?
Finallyyyy
That quick note at the bottom right is driving me nuts! I’m always hitting it by accident and there’s no way to turn it off.
they took &quot;top notch design&quot; a little too seriously
Marques:people who have a lot of money will prolly just wanna buy this laptop <br>Also Marques:Carries around a mac pro with him
typo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m08s">17:08</a>. the third device is supposed to be M1 Max MBP: 4.06, instead of M1 Pro MBP: 4.06
A review worth waiting for 👍🙂 Superb
Is the Magsafe connector on the new Mac backwards compatible?
That macbook is more powerful than my PC 😂😂
Truly next level
New &quot;top notch design&quot; lmao
What’s the app between the App Store and final cut in the dock called?
Just bought a intel mac a couple months ago so im not in the market for a long while, but I&#39;m definitely considering upgrading to one of these once this albatross of a keyboard gives up the ghost.
The inverted trackpad gestures are killing me.
i want one but i need 10 key number pad
I don&#39;t see how ethernet in the power supply could work with the magsafe connector.
apple is listening, especially now it is an age of youtube reviews with millions of followers that is more important than a news company that is doing reviews, the new era of marketing and improving products
You may be an apple fanboy if ...<br><br>... you take a ginormous box with fullsize Apple computer, instead of getting a proper tool (such as a windows laptop with 64GB RAM and one of those Nvidia 16GB Quadros)<br>... say that a laptop HDMI 2.0 laptop is next gen
These days I&#39;m actually looking forward to intro rather than the reviews 🤤🤤🤤
he using pixel agaiiiin
Why is everyone saying “these are tools” was anyone trying to eat a MacBook Pro or using it as decoration??

Labor rate &gt; equipment cost
The speed and efficiency of these machines actually scares me. I truly wish I could justify getting one but my business has nothing to do with what these are for and a base model M1 macbook air has been more than enough for my webpage and for studying but yeah, Apple has made the biggest leap in the recent history of the laptop.
Man, EVERY Apple product I have bought in the last 4 years has been absolute garbage 😔 My Airpod Max had HORRIBLE electronic issues, and only lasted 5 months. My 2018 macbook pro is slow, overheats like crazy, and the keyboard is just.....well.. you know.
Sick Intro!! - YOU DID IT AGAIN - D
Food for thought<br>Since it takes years to develop a chip M1 chip etc<br>What if apple on purpose made their few previous generation Mac, have less &amp; less port, touch bar etc(introduce problems)<br>Then release one with their own Chip, and also simultaneously fix all the problems (which they made)?
Why there’s no music in the end…?!?
congrats to all who bought &gt;50k apple workstations that now are on par with 13inch mbp :D


Carrying around a giant iMac has to be the silliest nerdy thing I’ve seen in awhile. If your laptop took all night to render a video you should’ve bought a windows machine. That notch is hideous. A clip on external webcam would have been much preferred.
Very nice, for creators.<br>I&#39;m good with my ROG Flow for traveling.
DO YOU WORK FOR APPLE??? biggest fanboy
That&#39;s a cute litle groot behind you. 🥰
What kind of Android engineering team develop only on laptop???
It started to look like the guys who created iphones and macbooks are different company lol. Macbooks actually listen to their customer like bringing back ports, fast charging, bringing back magsafe etc. While iPhones getting their phones harder to repair everyday
“OnlY 64 GigS oF RAm” 😢

No one&#39;s gonna mention the cool android plushy in the bg? &gt;.&lt;
Love it!
But does it run Crysis?
Worth the wait ,🔥🔥 that intro gawddamn 😌🔥🔥
With that kinda case you were pulling around, you could have fitted a Threadripper with 64 threads in there
Socks and Sandals please? 😁
Bruh just upload in 4k since most people watch on their phone anyways
seems like they did not update everything they could on the laptop just the ones that matter. Guess they are recouping RD costs
Just wanted to say I get really happy when I am able to see the video without the black bars on my phone with none of the important content being cut out. Props to the MKBHD Team
One less dongle
So, I imagine that Intel Mac Pro sales are going to plummet now that these bad boys are available.
These intros are getting fucking insane hahaha
FINALLYYYY
Which one would u suugest for an undergrad student??
Think you ment to write &quot;M1 Max MBP&quot; @ timecode <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a>
i will wear socks and sandals like Limus...lol
You put m1 pro twice in the export test numbers
I need to learm how it act when sharing screen in skype and streaming to youtube at the same time
So basically these MBPs are only worth for video professional at these prices
I want that vase in the back with grout in it.
Fire intro 🔥🔥🔥
They notched up the speed
I just know that the notch is big because next year they’ll put faceid on it so that they can say it has new features
Finally, the wait is over
Marques: So naturally my iMac Pro has more Ram than a small country.
Does this magsafe work with older gen laptop, I&#39;m talking 2017 air. I have a broken charger and the replacement is too costly in India
Finally its here😂😂🔥🔥🍎🍎
So MKBHD was one of those people who would use a huge iMac at Starbucks… 🤔
You&#39;re willing to accept all kinds of nonsense... did you vote Biden too?
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m11s">0:11</a> transition was meeean! Damn 🔥🔥
Yeah, next level notch. Powerful but ugly!
android logo with a notch !!!!
WAIT NOTCH ON THE LAPTOP ,RLY STOP WITH THIS ,LET&#39;S MAKE NOTCH ON THE TV .
Yeah. I maxed the M1 Max too and quickly sold my 22,000 geekbench 5 custom desktop build. These things are heavy lifters!!
ethernet powerbrick 🤯
I hope he really does wear socks and sandals if there is no face id. Maybe Linus will send him some LTT sticker for the sandals.
768 gbs of RAM?🙆🏾‍♂️
Apple gained respect on this one
So Apple after the MagSafe :) and the ports :) GIVE us an replaceable SSD and remove the glue from the battery !!! 1-2mm extra in height won’t bother anyone.
Omfg ... even the apple laptops have notches!!! Plus the keyboard looks sooooooo small ... who the fuck uses this track pad instead of a mouse that you need such a big TouchPad instead a good big keyboard!!! Why would you even buy this!
&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like linus&quot;<br>Now I don&#39;t want apple to put a faceid here on the next model.
Hey Marcus I&#39;m unfollowing you... U let that screen off easily.. but on s10e u were complaining really hard about fingerprint sensor
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m57s">16:57</a> There is a typo. That is M1 MAX, not M1 PRO.
I think the concern that Apple has with including Face ID on a Laptop is there is incredible fraud potential as compared to an iPhone. Just my 2 cents.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=22m12s">22:12</a> looking away from the camera while you&#39;re saying this? Huh... Wonder what would experts say about &quot;tilting to the right&quot;.
Thanks for your excellent review. I am so glad I held out for M1 pro. I am really looking forward to the performance difference to my old 2015 machine.
Touch Bar 😢😭😢 let’s rally for the TouchBar  return. 2.0
Watching your review from my MacBook Pro with M1 Pro chip, these devices are real beasts and I am already wondering how the M2 PRO and MAX are going to be!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m14s">7:14</a><br><b>tries to not smile</b><br><b>smiles a lot</b>
I like that crow sound
Thank you, Marques 🙏🏻 you&#39;re a life saver. For me, it is a huge amount to spend. Having your review now gives me the confidence 👍🏻 Thank you 🇮🇳
How come NO ONE has talled about the fact that there&#39;s no freaking keyboard britghness button?! It&#39;s soooo anoying 😩😩
best intro yet??
These MacBooks are tools for professionals and are not meant for just anybody. I hope people realise that. Also, wtf 768 GB of RAM?! WTAF!!
I will wear socks and sandals for a day like Linux 😂
Ports are ugly
Love these new MacBook Pros. Glad Apple took it on the chin and brought back the ports! And all these M1 chips keep impressing, seriously excited about the Mac again!
I’ve never been so excited for the review
🔥🔥🔥👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥🔥
Is that a clear backed icons debrand skin? I&#39;ve been asking for that since you launched that! DOPE
I was very surprised that Apple did not add ethernet port to the charging brick for them.
from 2012 design to 2021 Macbook Pro  1221
How long would the export take on the old Travel iMac Pro?
intro was fire
The touchbar was perfect for yt ads. No need for adblocker but you can easy skip the ads.
Imagine watching these videos in 2025 to buy 2021 MacBook pro when there is many unaffordable MacBooks are out.
So - I watched reviews from other channels and all I wanted was your review.
Nice. I&#39;m ok with my Toshiba.
Next level price as well. Let&#39;s wait and see what AMD Zen 4 has to offer and at what price.
Waiting for mac mini with same config ✌️
Why there are some shaky , unstable clips in the video?
Really impressive machine!<br>Couple of three things I would still point:<br>1. No full-size keyboard<br>2. Ethernet or USB-A would be nice<br>3. Cannot wait those few years for a 25% smaller notch now!
Touch Bar was garbage
14inch I mac a perfect and compact machine for handling , traveling. caring. ..... 👍

@Marques Browniee, thanks for a good review. If possible and if you do another review please add some extra time on the screen. I am a software developer and I curse all the laptopscreens up until now that I am Not able to work on outside. When coding I use different coding schemes and the colours and even the contrast are totally gone when I sit outside in the sun. Im using a MacBook Pro from 2018 at the moment and up until recently I was concidering the Dell laptops that seems to have upto 600nits, which might make it a bit better then the 450nits I got today. But I would really appreciate some real testing of the screens in the sun. We developers really need to get out in the sun a bit more :)
Marques finally recommended a macbook.

Great Mac book ❤️
Me boi i need to hear them speakers, Linus wasn&#39;t impressed n now i m skeptical <br>Also WHAT THE HECK y is such an expensive device has &quot; a help in a pinch &quot; Type hardware !?
Reading results of rendering speeds from Pixel 6 is the real badass move

It always freaks me out that MKBHD swipes with 3 fingers to the LEFT to go to the desktop/app on the LEFT it is such a mind freeze i would never be able to get used to that

what the fuck is going on im speechless EDIT WAS ARM ALWAYS THIS MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGE


Mac mini pleasse


In other words, for everyone else who cant really justify the specialised design of these macbook pros, maybe think about another macbook unless 16” is needed no matter what. These are extremely expensive even for base config. So yeah.


The price is too GODDAMN high!!
It is disgusting how much are we letting Apple get away with this notch nonsense
Still not better than the limited edition 1/1 mac you reviewed on April 1st
More RAM than my SSD <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a>
Marquez, best intros on YouTube as always 🥲 the beauty in it. Small, but very appreciated
Did u say 700 GB of RAM?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=5m36s">5:36</a> i see a paradox here 😂
I want to know their mining speed
FINANLY
MKBHD is not the first one who published the review on the new MacBook Pro, but it is the best: authentic as always, comprehensive and professional, I love this channel


&quot;A new top-notch design&quot;<br>I see what you did there.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m31s">12:31</a> Get ready garoto! Can&#39;t wait to see. Haha


The new MacBook is Top Notch…..No I mean literally top notch.

why is the charging brick SO BIG, i mean cmon apple.
Thank you apple for giving me back the ports that you took away in the first place!
Marques might cry when they drop the Mac Pro  version


This one is for &quot;ENTHUSIASTS&quot; 🤷
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=13m45s">13:45</a>, lol, single core is pretty the same as on M1 Macbook Air, no?


The most awaited video in tech community
All the tech reviewers who are now getting rid of their iMac pros... Please recycle... send one to me... thank you
Hey Marques, could you please make a video of how to safely and free of charge delete duplicated photos from the Photos app on MacBook? There is a huge/wierd bug where photos are being duplicated and it is extremelly iritating. Also, the bug seems to affect more and more users. Thanks.
plot twist: there is no iMac in that giant box, it&#39;s Marques&#39; ego!


How long will it be before they stop including chargers with laptops?
Awesome video,  great details!
this notch is soo disgusting man
&quot;The new Top-Notch Design!&quot;  😂 No pun inteded?


I soo which that AutoCAD&#39;s Revit worked on mac!


You sold me. A man with no Apple products, and no need for a laptop nor even a new computer. I want this damn thing.
Why didn’t he just ssh into the machine remotely??


Absolutely worth the wait, this laptop blew my mind <br>Unfortunately my usual laptop budget is less than $1000 so no 😂
Sheeesh


The plot twist: It&#39;s just the middle of transition period.


Next year they will announce they have reduced the notch by 30%


Everyone who took an online college class with videos you “can’t skip” are gonna hate they removed the Touch Bar😂😭


Notch
Love your intros
Apple, kudos to you <br>It&#39;s the first time that as a windows user, you make me wish that we&#39;d something like that M1 max chip 🙂🙂
MKBHD and his team are… next level


I personally really liked the thinner and more concise port layout that the MacBook had gone these past years. I’m not a content creator. I don’t use the sd card slot ever, I had bought all usb-c detachable external storage media, and used AirPlay to connect to Apple TV. I’m going to miss the more simple versions of the MacBook and hope that they don’t kill off the base version and don’t change the MacBook Air styling.
Video was nice and sweet.
I will never get tired of your intros. Amazing!
Jokes on you, they brought the exact ports from the time they took them out. Thats why theyre outdated.
Love the groot flower pot in the background! Where did you get that? Mind sharing the link?
Safari 15 can&#39;t even hit 60 fps because of its performance issues.


Oh snap, we made it into the Dock!
I’m missing TouchBar a lot for many things: word predictions, form compiling, FinalCut Pro… <br>I don’t care about ports, I’m the USB-C team, I have one dock at home, uno dock at work and a very small dongle with Ethernet and few USB-A. So I don’t care that HDMI is only 2.0. Those are the best notebook out there, really game changers.
That intro 👌
50,000 Mac Pro? Sounds more like a 50,000 cheese grater compared to the M1 Max 🤣
Mindblowing - simply next level
Notch is completely wrong beacuse basically the content is under it, and the &quot;more display&quot; thing is a huge bs! <br>I tried this macbook pro IRL, and the content shown was way smaller than the entire display, to not go under the notch!<br>So the display isn&#39;t bigger, but the damn top bar is!<br>And, as you showed up, the notch cover some option on the top bar...<br>This notch is the worst thing i&#39;ve ever seen on a laptop!<br>Litterally the worst one!<br>Again, i tried this laptop for many minutes, an i also owned an iPhone 10 for 2,5 years, so i know exactly what the notch means on a screen!<br>Few months ago i said, hironicly, &quot;can you imagine if apple puts a notch a mac&quot;... damn! they did! <br>What a bad decision! what a shame!<br>And for what? a ridicolous average 1080p camera with zero features?!<br>Not in 4k, not in 60fps, without autofocus, without widelens (like ipads), without flashlight, without faceid... i mean, what the actual f*ck!
I think, that they forgot to plug in fans😂
Can&#39;t wait to see how pc fans will react to the 40 core risc mac pro performance (in the future)
DID HE SAY 768GB OF RAM?
Yeah the price is too next level. €3850 in my country, that&#39;s almost $4500. Really can&#39;t believe people are buying this.
seems like a great machine to scroll reddit and watch YT. i need it.
Does anyone else have that problem with FCXP where when you pinch in and out the audio waveforms disappear when scroll sideways?


What about architects? Mostly softwares don’t support mac and m1. Don’t you need such performances on the go, designers? Developers please do some justice.
I use the M1 Air for coding on Xcode and it&#39;s incredible how smoothly it works not having a fan... The best thing is still the battery, I could never go back to a regular laptop.
<b>” A new Top Notch Design”</b><br><br>😂 oh Marques you plateau much 😂
Loved how Dave 2D and Marques reminded that they are just tools to get the job done. Reminds consumers to buy their tools with priorities in mind.


One question about the sd-card slot, why is everyone complaining that it is uhs-ii instead of uhs-iii, if there are still no cards and no cameras with that standard
The new MacBooks are just as much as a tool as iPhones, put in 5G, make it tougher with replaceable parts, then it’s actually a „tool“.
Have waited for this review for so long😂
&quot;In a pinch, one less dongle!&quot;
Poor intel.. Lmao
Touch bar will be missed. Everyone talks about the performance and other stuff, but the kind of ease which touchbar provided was second to none. On to the top it, touchbar was customizable too. Now, you just can&#39;t configure functions keys, because they are just keys. 😛<br>And, It&#39;s really sad to see that after spending too much money on these heavily configured machines, still the ports version is not the latest one.
Really appreciate the info!
They really are JUST TOOLS!<br>You can&#39;t have a car that is the best on a rugged road and when you come with it on a Formula One track to overtake Formula One cars (something like that;))!
Top notch design! 😂
We need 60fps video man
While I can appreciate the &quot;shiny-newness&quot;  of  these new Macs?...I wish they  didn&#39;t always &quot;pretend&quot; that what they&#39;re doing is &quot;groundbreaking&quot; and new! yeah....they  ditched the  taskbar.....and went with a &quot;blacked-out&quot; keyboard / deck. But mag safe isn&#39;t new...its just &quot;back&quot;...and don&#39;t get ,e started on this insane proclamation of &quot;PORTS!!!&quot;....uhh...while they  might  not  run Apple&#39;s OS?...Windows machines  have had ports for the last decade!...LoL!
Your videos are pure gold🔥❤️
Nice review, as always. But I don&#39;t understand why all youtubers consider pros only the ones working on video or audio projects.<br>What about designers and engineers?  What about Autocad and Revit performance?
This is awesomely crazy!
Hey it’s me MKBHD and I have had this M1 Max Mac for 1yr now..here are my thoughts.. 🤔😂
Ethernet ove MagSafe?
Can&#39;t wait to see you wearing socks and sandles 😂
I&#39;m not happy with any Apple products it just big marketing strategy there products are more like basic only. On paper and on ads big figures but in reality not near to those figures.
i&#39;m gonna skip on this one, let them remove the unibrow then maybe
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m49s">4:49</a> anyone knows what these headphones are called
Good advertising
I wish i was talented enough to need this... lmao
Sock and sandals. Like Linus 😂
To be honest you could retire all your pcs in the office and just use laptops plugged into external displays not just the travel MP.. haha imagine whats to come with there Other Pro Machines
I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day.<br>Linus: Amateur
Wait a minute, music producers? More than 70% of the plugins doesn&#39;t even work in these machines, it&#39;s the worst machine for the producers. Sure it&#39;s powerful but compatibility is wayy behind and nobody talks about it. It&#39;s just another shallow review tbh.
I am pretty sure Apple made and designed this macbook pro with Marques in mind
Pretty cool intro
Most monitors/tv’s don’t even support HDMI 2.1 so 2.0 is completely acceptable
This will be the last laptop you need for a long time, the performance is unbelievable!
Apple, bring back the headphone jack in iPhones please
Been watching each and every MBP 21 reviews since announced, however I&#39;ve been waiting for your video review. I must say, you just convinced me that this would be the right decision for any creative professional. Thanks, really great video! Love your content

I am Groot
That is fine but apple do not innovate. Look at the surface pro 8 from Microsoft look at the form factor touch screen pen input etc. Apple need to take the I pad and and MacBook and bring them together into one machine in 2021 computers should be touch screens and have pen input on them and until apple do that their mac books will always just be modern day typewriters and Marquez I want you to call them out on their mistakes they will listen to you and mr who’s the boss arrun
Apple putting an SD card reader in a laptop! That&#39;s REVOLUTIONARY! Truly next level thinking 🌈
The main question for me is still have been unsaid. Is scrolling stutters still present on this new MacBooks? Because on my MBP M1 base model, it is still noticeable jitters when scrolling even after Monterey update.
What&#39;s up with the &quot;buuuut&quot;&#39;s in recent videos? Some kind of a bet? :D
The MAC PRO will be insane
BUT......
Socks and sandles for a day... hmm
You can thank Arm for a lot of this!
&quot;So these laptops have a new <i>top-notch</i> design&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> 😆
I think both this new macbook and the apple watch series 7 desgin means the new generation iphone will be familiar in shape.
He uploaded!!
Im glad I can stick with my 2020 MacBook. I just bought it earlier this year and already invested in dongles and such and I do like some of the changes (the top notch, shape, ports &amp; charger, the carved MacBook Pro on the bottom) but what I&#39;m working with is fine for me. Unless someone thinks its worth it for me to sell mine and have to fork up extra $500-$600 for a 14&quot;
I&#39;m going to get one just to watch YouTube videos. 👍🏼




airpods 3 vid was edited on MBP, what was this edited on Marques?
Top Notch video 😁
Finally man. Now I know the true value of the MacBook pro.
I stand to be corrected but the display is 8-bit + dithered and not true 10-bit panel (via Rene Ritchie). From what I understand the difference is hardly noticeable but still - not a 10bit panel. It won&#39;t put me off from buying one. I think they are amazing.
To wear socks and sandals for a day isn’t a challenge. I wear them every day of the year 😂
This intro man, I think Marques and his team are trying to match Apple level of Production. The transition and the animations in the intro were lit 💥💥. Love your videos man; No less than watching a movie.
Can it run Crysis though ?
Awesome video!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m32s">12:32</a>😂😂😝
I watch his reviews even though I don&#39;t own any of the products
Just here to say I liked the intro
768 GB Ram 😳
Make a vid explaining the metaverse
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m00s">4:00</a> does a space gray iPhone come with a space gray brick, nvm u don’t get one
Just playing all games on 14’’ with Gfn and it’s ok haha. Don’t need to w8st the Mac’s potencial on gaming.
I&#39;m so confused was this a M1 pro max review or M1 pro maxed out review... 🤔
The long awaited review is finally here 🤗
amazing intro
Truly a waste of money compared to m1 pro...
Every thing about this channel is just great
Hey there groot ,I see ya
I never knew you were a fan of Veritasium. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m53s">7:53</a>
I don’t like them being thicker than the predecessors
give me my souped up Mac M1 max MINI and me happy and get to avoid the notch and get to save $1k - $2k...  nice review.
&quot;It is really easy to complain about this when you&#39;re not actually using the laptop&quot; Yep that&#39;s spot on... I&#39;ve been thinking of getting the MacBook pro ever since it got released and frankly I don&#39;t see why the notch is a big issue. I&#39;m looking for performance as an animator, and it&#39;s got it. I like it. I used to never like using apple computers but the  Macbook Pro has been impressing me since the last release and I&#39;m finally ready to add it to my arsenal.
Yesss!
Advice on an all-round laptop for editing video and stills and gaming aswel
Hello
I am here for the intro
Am I crazy for hearing ‘Right Above It’ by Lil Wayne in that intro song??
That intro 🔥🔥🔥🔥
stop trying to promote they arent gonna hire you
I’ve been patiently waiting for this
Sarah I heard u wanna buy a car😡😡😡

Finally! Marques! ✌🏽
Omg😯😮!!! travelling with an iMac pro fully specked out 😂😜👌
This is amazing!!! Now imagine an Apple M chip desktop…the ungodly amount of power 💥
These laptops are 🔥🔥
Dope intro 👌
So basically a laptop. Dope
🔥
I have the M1 Pro from last year but this really has my attention, really want something for some graphic design work and that bc 16 inch model is just calling to me lol
Whenever i watch one of ur videos i get nervous. Cos I know it may end up being upgrade time. 🤔<br>Also, when i see someone buy a gaming pc i think man, what r u dooiiin? Just buy a mac already and use bootcamp🙄<br>And marques in 6 months or so when imac hits u better get a new suitcase ready 😆
I&#39;m pretty sure that iMac wasn&#39;t the only machine capable of manage huge video file from red camera!<br>There has been very powerful windows laptop out there since years...<br>I&#39;m talking about serious machines for pros!
Sorry but that notch is a deal break for me
If u get a space grey MagSafe cable, then ull want a space grey brick 😂
Yeah, than you compile C# or Java code... And puff, it return to be a Chromebook.
Can that MacBook Pro M1 Max compete with the cheese grater Mac?
I don’t have enough money to buy this new MacBook yet in my budget but I’m really sad that the touch bar is gone now. I really liked it. I could customize it to my workflow and I’ll have to get used to not having it when I upgrade
finally
Me using my new dell g7 for everything and still better choice than macbook as I can do gaming too in my dell
So you edit those professional videos? Damn you’re so talented!
Thanks for making this video! Was debating watching it because I wanna go to sleep...lol...but that was worth staying up for!!
I watch these for the editing!
How much Ram? 😆😅😅😅😅😅
if you have RAM hiccups you need more SSD. If you max out 64Gb, you should probably buy 8Tb of SSD
Great for media A/V content creators... But not for anyone who cant use Apple or ARM/M1 native apps. I need native AutoCAD and Bluebeam for it to matter.
Another apple product that I can&#39;t afford 😂
Well after that carrying imac thing.. it looks more like apple is adapting to MKBHD standards 🤣
Worth the wait!! Great video!!
Wow! MKBHD fully recommending a product without any hesitation
Finally !  “You only realize the importance of something when it’s gone”. <br>Marques I really missed your opinion .
I&#39;m honestly waiting for Groot to dance in your background
Great video 📸
ABOUT TIME AND YES IM YELLING!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m50s">9:50</a> Barack Obama - Follows You.......<br>Nice flex
This was one of the reviews I was waiting for. It didn&#39;t disappoint :)
Worth the wait
Gor gaming this pc is really bad you cannot play normally gta 5 or doom eternal because fps droping. So its bad idea for gaming.
I love the touchbar... wish there was an upgrade to get that again.. but I guess I’ll just stick to my 13in for now til people realize the mistake they&#39;ve made bullying apple into removing it.
Every intro is getting more and more refined....<br>Keep going dude
i think the notch is that big so apple can add faceid in future models and use the same screen. Cost saving...
&quot;4k60, good in a pinch&quot; - how spoiled are we?
Consumer- we need a more powerful MacBook<br>Apple- <b>YES</b>
Will photoshop perform any better with 64gb instead of 32GB?
That intro 😭❤️
this is 2015 design perspective , old desisgn
So is it safe to say the M1 Max only needed 2% of its full power to beat the Mac Pro? 😅
Maya doesn&#39;t support apples GPU while rendering
Apple out here making Moore’s law relevant
Waiting for when MacBook is the Gaming machine.
The intro this time tho! ❤️
Just ordered my M1 16” Max 32GB so excited.
Marques, do you use P3 or sRGB on you Mac ???
jeez that damn notch
Only 64 gb of ram😂
Thanasis Antetokounmpo with another fab tech review!
An actual &quot;PRO&quot; machine.
The b rolls are better than official promos
I might go for a Mac next
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m34s">12:34</a> like Linus. Ohh no. He went in! :D
I wish they&#39;d at least give the option for a touch bar. I love mine a lot so I&#39;ll probably only upgrade to the regular M1 mbp if I do at all
half depth SD CARD?! wow....apple still managed to annoy me somehohw
Do you think the departure of Jonny Ive from Apple is the reason for the changes, like more ports and thicker laptop?
When you turn the menu bar black (with that utility) it looks just amazing. <br>Fully reflects the idea it is an extended screen, not the notch is cutting out a portion of the display.<br>Like imagine if in any previous MacBook the menu bar just moved into the top bezle. <br>Definitely should be an option for that.

Finally 😍
768 gb of ram!!!!!???????
Should they release another MacBook next year? Or should they drop M2 in 2023? They seem good enough to go to a two year refresh cycle.
People that are in doubt whether they should get M1 Pro or Max, should probably “just” get the Pro.<br>Oh… and can’t believe Marques used to carry around an iMac on the go 😂
The notch is so stupid.
But Can I play RuneScape on this yes or no
The size of the notch is a way Apple save money in the future upgrades, they gonna add more stuff in there so just 1 size with a big batch order will save them money with production as well as R&amp;D.
the goat has spoken
4 hrs ago and already almost half a mil views. Amazing MKBHD.
Happy diwali ❤️
Apple started to realize that the 3rd party market for port accessories got cheaper and more varied
Waiting for this since ages!!
The separate brick and cable is definitely an upside, had a 2015 MacBook Pro and one day I just heard &quot;Puff&quot;, then smoke comes out of the brick and I knew the charger is toast. Surprisingly, the cable is completely fine after 5 years
rather get  gaming laptop for better performance and also be able to play games
Oh we look forward to ensuring you wear those socks and sandals.....the internet never forgets.....
Can I game on one?
And then there&#39;s the notch up top
watch the sales skyrocket because MKBHD finally posted his review 📈📈
An apple silicon desktop might as well be a quantum computer, honestly.
Missed opportunity by Apple to call it the Maxbook, smh
Intel:  Alder Lake!!  Linus: Alder Lake!!!!!   Apple:  Hold my beer……
A little bit of gameplay review would have been great 😅
Great review! Thank you for recording!
I can’t wait, wonder what it’s going to be like to program on this
at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=21m31s">21:31</a>, i thought the MacBook screen was completely flipped, only to realize 5 minutes later that it was a sticker
I&#39;m waiting for wireless dongles / the day when there will be no ports
Attempt 5 can I get iphone 13 pro max if you don&#39;t mind please 🙏🏼


Top notch design? Good one.
Was so stoked for the M1 Max but after all the tests where M1 Max throttling a lot and the fan noise made me order M1 Pro 🤯
Would have been interesting seeing these video benchmarks vs a pc laptop and desktop at a similar price
people should call it the maxbook for short
It&#39;s as if someone went to the future, stole a MacBook and came back.<br><br>This is incredible 😲


the definitive review
Everything about this is excellent except the Notch
&#39;Well.... If you have to ask it doesn&#39;t apply to you💁&#39;... My favorite tech answer to everyone forever!! 😂😂😂
That Android in background tho... 😂😂
Am I the only one who thought, there&#39;s a fly hovering over new MacBook Pro and then another fly comes but then all of a sudden it writes &quot; 2021&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m17s">0:17</a>
&quot;768 gigs of Ram&quot;?!.. Wish I had 1/10 of that...
„Top notch design“<br><br>I see what you did there 😂
I find it kind of sad  that  Cad and fusion 360 has not yet  made a version for the  M1 pro  or the  M1 Max  chips .
The app build times is what I’m most looking forward to, too. Besides an actually viable battery lifetime to Code a whole day abroad the charger :)

Pretty soon movie sets are just gonna be a bunch of people holding iphones around more people with some guy in the back on a macbook
Where do you recommend I go to start learning how to edit on my ‘21 MBP
I know now from apple doing is for ..<br>Is for ecosistem, with iphone for media creator and macbook for media editor..
I liked the way you said ‘Top ‘Notch’ Design’  …😀
If i bought a Mac Pro i would be punching the air. hopefully they allow those who bought them to upgrade the cpu over to Apple Silicon in a modular style.
I think it&#39;s safe to stop calling out on Tim Cook for not innovating in his tenure.  Steve Jobs would be so happy to see where his company has come, marrying innovation and turnover perfectly..
I did not know i needed an amplifier for my DT 990 PRO. 😬
I have the M1X 16 inch. Since updating to Monterey12.0.1 there is an issue with the Magsafe while charging the MBP when it is turned off. Apple seems to be aware of it. But the support forums are full of user complaints. When the tutned off MBP is charged with the magsafe, the amber charging led is flashing and the charging chime comes one continuously. It appears, the computer is not charging in this state. Hopefully Apple will patch this behavior soon.
Lately, I&#39;ve been coming across a lot of random comments here &amp; there on Marques&#39;s vids mentioning how he doesn&#39;t really know tech &amp; just reads specs from the sheet &amp; Boom ! the video is done which I&#39;m sure is certainly not true. Now I&#39;ve personally never been a huge fan of all those mainstream so called tech reviewers myself who for real just read out the specs, but I respect &amp; appreciate the kind of content Marques &amp; Dave put out for their audience. And now, Marques just shut &#39;em all down by putting out such a great review. This video&#39;s a freaking flying 360 kick on all of &#39;em haters&#39; faces. Love it !

What is the intro track?
If he get&#39;s married his kids doesnt have to worry about getting maxed out tech.
Latecomer🤨🤨
did u said mac pro has 768 gigs of ram?
Ah yes! UHS 2 speed<br><br><br>I’m just eating my cereal enjoying the B roll
why showing pixel on the video do you  want to say that you are daily driving that?
I still don’t get the HDMI port, worst in every single aspect than a type C
CONGRATS FOR 15M 😭❤️
Never saw you this excited about a product like this one. And I agree, 16” M1 Max is the way to go. Really happy to see this performance. Apple killed the laptop market. Everyone will have to re calibrate.
























Another revolutionary product from Apple, no other laptop could do what the m1 max laptop could do
If the next version of macs comes with a notch as big as this without Face ID, he has to wear socks and sandals for a day....<br>Ya&#39;lll, I&#39;m keeping this comment here in case....
would replace my 2016 mac with this but that notch :(((((
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m59s">16:59</a> Should say &quot;M1 Max MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>&quot;. Great review, I can confirm that on my new 14&quot; MBP I don&#39;t really notice the notch anymore (despite wanting to use a wallpaper that is black at the top of it) despite using a OnePlus 7T Pro without any kind of punch hole or notch :)
Nocth on laptop isincredible for camera.. N Make That Big bezzel gone far away from screen.. But that nocth if Take iphone rear camera on that is more incredible ..
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a> Okay🤣
“Top notch design” 🤣🤣🤣<br><br>Personally also have no issues with it and makes sense as you say as a design language and gives it recognition.
Wear socks and sandal, like Linus 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The wait was so worth it for the b-roll alone
Wow these seem like fantastic computers! Too bad they are macs...
But still no SW support😔😔
So what kind of send off / viking burial are you going to give your traveling iMac Pro
“I am Groot.”
What a tool!!
lol I love how excited you are about these laptops. this is great. Im happy apple came through.
they could&#39;ve reduced one more dongle if they gave just &quot;one&quot; usb type A. Now that i think of it, they removed it because of its thin form factor (2015 macbook pro) . But now, it doesn&#39;t make sense.

A rare product that MKBHD likes and it doesn’t even come in matte black
Been waiting for this!
just got the M1 2020 last week because I only use it for YouTube and Homework but one day ill get the 16 inch cuz its big 👍🏽
Rich people complaining about the notch while I’m here complaining why I cant even afford an M1 Macbook 😅😅😅
768 Gigs of RAM? That&#39;s almost 3 times my SSD capacity!
What the fuck, a notch on a laptop?
I enjoy watching tech videos of devices I can&#39;t afford 🙃🙃🙃
FINALLY (in my Rock voice)
I can’t stop watching videos about this laptop
I was going to sell my 2016 15” MBP to get those new ones, but Monterey update bricked my MBP. Now I’m getting to get Apple to fix if at no cost. Many people are reporting the same. Let’s see what Apple does.
I hate The Notch - stop approving this moronic design
The HDMI port is a mistake imo. Could have used another USB C port. Everyone who would buy one of these likely have a USB C monitor or could buy a USB C to HDMI cable..
@Marques.  Your introduction part is  getting next level.  I have been admiring it quiet long and  Specially for this one you nailed it.
Pretty sure the reason apple chose to put HDMI 2.0 and UHS-II is to give themselves some room to make &quot;upgrades&quot; next year.
Technically these are a new line of laptops. The MacBook Pro with the M1 and Touch Bar are still there. The Pro and Max is an addition.
you know he’s serious when the review is longer than 20 mins :)
So they convinced there cult that ports are not required for past 4 years selling dongles making bucks , just to bring them back , seems apple
Groot!!
I like the top notch I don’t think it’s an issue.
The marques first kiss in front of a camera <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m18s">20:18</a>
Absolutely BODIED that intro studio team! 🔥
Yeah... it doesn&#39;t get in the way (the notch) but what if you&#39;re using the auto hide feature on the menu bar?<br>Does it works like when you&#39;re in full screen mode?
I honestly wouldnt be suprised if they did all this for the long game aka right now when they get huge amounts of people to buy the &quot;New&quot; macbooks with shit they took away to just add it back and pretend like they never made a mistake.
Top notch design, bad pun bad pun... lol
mo gaming test?
did he say 768 Gigs of ram?! is there such thing?!
油管上，你唯一的不一样
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m18s">20:18</a> when he do that:   i felt that 🍀😊
is there gonna be an m1 pro review? i feel like that’s more applicable to most of us.
the wait is over.u&#39;ve starved me for long.
anyone notice the iphones at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m35s">8:35</a>
These are really a niche product.  Average users don&#39;t need more than an M1 MacBook Air.  Even a lot of users with above average requirements don&#39;t need more than a MacBook Air.  Plus, they&#39;re lighter and less expensive.

Seems like a worthy successor to the last &quot;supercomputer fast&quot; Mac notebook from 20 years ago.
BUT BUT BUT no usb port ??????
HEADPHONE JACK, Woooowwwww
I&#39;ve noticed that you didn&#39;t release your review when other YouTubers did two weeks ago.
MacBook Pro M1 Max
im sorry, 768gb of ram. What?!
Awesome review! I really enjoy the chapter function, makes jumping through videos a breeze.
Editing! The audio is not quite lined up correctly!
He said, it has a top notch design. 😂😂😂
Everyone already made this exact same video a week ago.
Tbh if they didn’t remove the Touch Bar I wouldn’t be as mad as I know I would be
I really, really wish I needed one of these. It sounds like Apple have reclaimed the laptop top spot.
How is for the other apps other than editing video?
How are they gonna make a mac pro better than this??! I wanna see that.
holy shit bro how do these intros just keep getting better and better
Marques: &quot;If the next version of this laptop still has a notch this big and doesn&#39;t add Face ID, I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus.&quot;<br><br>Apple engineers: &quot;OH SHIT, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE FACE ID SHIPS WITH NEXT YEAR&#39;S MACBOOK PRO.&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m02s">7:02</a> Yeah they go backwards on the last 4 years of mac book pros and install 4 years old ports 🤣
You guys think Elon will also start making these products and better
I love the baby groot plant.
Marquee saying “ Jesus” … !
The notch is a deal breaker. Unless some third-party (or first-party) option becomes available to permanently remove it and decrease the screen size with the heigh of the notch I will be switching to Linux. My menu rows frequently go under the notch, it looks like absolute garbage (just like on the iPhone which I still have not gotten used to). <br><br>I went to look at it at an Apple store on the off chance that I was wrong. I was not. It&#39;s as atrocious as ever.
Just please stop supporting and embracing the notch. You would not have accepted it from another company. There’s just no need for a notch on a laptop, as simple as that.
I love the internals, but I don&#39;t like the externals.
Nice technology ❤️
BRO, THAT INTRO WAS ON ANOTHER LEVEL
AMD ryzen and intel feel crying when you look at this hahaha..chip chapter, apple will win because it is the most powerfully chip
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=6m17s">6:17</a> do people not know that HDMI-to-C cables exist? <br>I haven&#39;t used a dongle for HDMI since 2018
The surface produkt where always comfortable with driving 600 ohm headpfones. So, seems like a weird flex from apple
I prefer the build of the Touch Bar model. I also don’t like the magnetic charger over USB-C
For him to say Jesus! He is definitely blown away by the performance.
If they don&#39;t add faceid by the next time they have a notch I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals like Linus.<br><br>Ok, prepare for that to happen everyone.
It never really happened until the MKBHD vid drops 🔥
PC better because you can upgrade. why are apple sheep still buying this overpriced crap?
Has anyone noticed groot behind mkbhd
Please  kindly  give me the 14 inch to support my work.great fun from Ghana Africa
On April 1st he posted the best Mac he ever reviewed, little does Marques know that he would actually be doing that in November as well
Can&#39;t wait seeing you wearing socks and sandals 😂
இது எல்லாம் பார்க்கத்தான் முடியும் 😝
hoping to buy this someday ❤
Everytime he says &#39;Next Level&#39;, I get reminded of aespa.<br>😂 Top notch design tho
Nobody: <br>Me: watching this video on my last year MacBook
i see that black GMMK PRO<br>don&#39;t be shy, keyboard haul video pls.
Top notch design... litterally 😅😅😅just got my 14&quot; M1 max 64-64, stuuuuuuning! Design, power, skills, puuuurfect
Intel are fucked. Praise the Lord. We may soon be rid of their spyware
How soon before we see Windows based laptops manufacturing their own chip sets too? Very happy with my M1 MacBook Air, my partner was so impressed she got one for herself too!
Can’t even afford the head phones…. But maybe In a few years time, this will be an amazing option second hand
When your 50k desktop computer is trash now…
Basically he is trying to say that its a good laptop for him
Slowest review of the fastest MacBook Pro.  Too late.
Peep the Coinbase wallet 👀
Showing off Pixel on MBP review is truly badass.
You should have taken the cognizance of the price as well.
That notch is UGLY 🤮

so I&#39;ve watched a bunch of new MBP 14&quot;/16&quot;  reviews including &quot;stress testing&quot; reviews and not a single one I&#39;ve seen so far has even a single external display plugged in for the &quot;stress tests&quot;. Over to you @MarquesBrownlee, I know you understand that these Macs have  DRAM shared by the GPU and CPU cores. IME on a Mac mini and 13&quot; MBA having a 4K external display plugged in can eat into system resources, it impacts the RAM, the subsystem bus etc, so it&#39;s worth testing, most people I know would be sing an External display to edit video, even on set, just not blogging maybe. <br><br>Just plugging a 4K into my old 15&quot; intel MBP turns the fans on with no major apps running, that&#39;s a heat issue though not a performance related issue.
I love your videos my guy!!!!
I respect the return to ports so much. That sd card slot is insanely nice


They probably made the notch that big so they can add the FaceID sensors there in the future without having to expand a previously smaller notch
I wonder how fast this opens an iOS simulator
Remember people, the M series of chips are “Mobility” focused chips that’s designed for low power consumption. <br>We haven’t even seen the desktop chip series yet. We don’t even know what it will be called.
I like apple, but need android and windows to give 🍎 some tough competition

Im first time seen marques saying next level
maybe for a resident of the United States, this price is normal, but for my country it is too luxurious thing.
Wish they add CD-ROM
Was that an ICONs DBrand Skin for the 16&quot;? WHERE IS THAT? I need it!
Apple literally made a laptop for Marques 👨‍💻
I&#39;m really surprised they didn&#39;t sort out that notch behaviour before they released this laptop
this belongs on the Hub. <br>i&#39;m now tempted to throw 7k away for this beaut...


&quot;The new MacBook Pros have a <b>top-notch</b> design&quot;. 😂😂 😂I see what you did there...
the starting where 2021 macbook pro was on the back side of laptop did not look good ,not the MKBHD quality .
Do they run Windows 11 though? 🤔
YouTubers are video professionals now ? Hahaha
Intro ❤️
Using the 16&quot; Macbook as a base to display the 14&quot; is flexing on another level
without this guy apple would have less customers LOL im honest since 20years i never was satisfied with a laptop... i tried alot of models... over the years... last one was a surfacebook 2... idk compared to my desktop they all suck... im so used to work on a desktop with good speeds... i cant handle the slow laptop problems... i get what hes talking about
Shame on Apple for ever removing the ports and boasting about adding them. Glad they are back but the pricing on these …… and that notch jeeeezzz
what a great time to be alive. just imagine how advanced these chips will be within the next 10 yrs. all being said, thanks to apple all the other chip companies are gonna start to be more innovative, hopefully.








That&#39;s a nice Macbook Pr.... Oh Hello There, GROOT
768gb ram 😱
I&#39;m not an Apple fan, but these new MacBooks look awesome
Notch is horrid.
Anyone know where he got that cool little electronic map of the NYC subway system?
Windows stole their design that&#39;s why they added a notch to stand out 😂
Fact : Intel still has the highest single core score.

If not for the price, these macbooks would dominate the laptop market easily
UmActuallyImma1st
how many of you noticed the &#39;&#39;HOW IMAGINARY NUMBERS WERE FORMED&#39;&#39; VIDEO POP up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=7m53s">7:53</a>
$655 dollar + labor $100 for screen repair. Who love to bring this unit lap-ing around? think twice.
I had a hands on with these laptops in Best Buy earlier today and completely fell in love! They&#39;re so nice! Hopefully getting the 16 inch M1 Pro for Christmas!
Dang let us know where you downloaded all that extra ram from 👀

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a> MKBHD glitched
so they&#39;re a &quot;top notch design&quot; huh...
Using the new pixel there eh? Haha
Okay....but how is that possible !<br>No...seriously....can somebody check the year and make sure it still is 2021 or my phone is just broken or something.....
Why so late ... did Jon Prosser cause the delay🤔
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m52s">3:52</a> Did you forget to grade that footage? 😅
I’ve been waiting for this video from you 🤩
Btw fun fact: while they look thicker another reviewer actually measured and turns out the 14” is thinner than the old 13” MBP at the thickest point- the clever tapered edge design just made the old ones look even thinner.






























Marques is really happy. You can almost feel it
that intro 🔥
The intro gets better and better everytime👌
One less dongle ! 😂😂
It must be annoying seeing soooo many YouTubers review the same thing
Did anyone count how many times he said &quot;I will be editing videos on a laptop&quot;?
&gt; top notch<br>I see what you did there.<br>Edit: well he made it more obvious later. I wrote this at the beginning of the video.
Did any else see the douche on the table ? 👀
Some rush to get a review early, and then MKBHD does this and then you understand; this is next level reviewing
Tell me you procrastinate without telling me you procrastinate:<br>MKBHD: <b>Macbook time</b> &quot;Thurs Nov 4, 4:10pm&quot; (EST)<br>LMAO

Dude casually said  &quot;my mac pro has 768 gigs of ram&quot; like it&#39;s not a big deal at all! I thought I was a beast having 64gb of ram in my work desktop and 32gb ram in my laptop.......LMAO!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m35s">16:35</a> Is there a skin on your Pixel 6 pro? The gray on the top of mine white one isn&#39;t that dark
&quot;top&quot; notch design :-)
There’s no excuse for the iMac pro to have a notch.
Finally 🙄
If this computer had an USB type A and the RJ45 on the charger... would be the greater laptop ever.
Ethernet!  True
I couldn’t concentrate on the review because you opened by traveling with an iMac Pro…
The port limitation is all about bandwidth. Already there’s no other laptop out there that can support all those ports AND 3 full speed thunderbolt 4 ports. The controller for all those newer standards are likely a couple generations away.







That intro was worth the wait for this video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m24s">17:24</a> Boom!
so let me get this straight, the mac pro the 50k mac pro is worse at editing than  a laptop? I mean, that is impressive as fuck, but didn&#39;t the mac pro came out like less than 2 years ago?
Your intros are Truely Next Level!
i still haven&#39;t found a solution to finger oill on MacBook keys, please suggest anything that worked for you
I can&#39;t afford it now but I&#39;m watching this review. One day I will get it!!
They finally fixed the effing magsafe cord!  Thank goodness.  I used to go through 1 a year.
When you feel okay saying it only has 64gb of ram 😂😂
2.44
Your overlayed labels for the export times has an error. The last should be M1 Max not M1 Pro.
Not a fan of Apple
Shouldnt it be named Maxbook pro?
Jesus that intro
I predict the reason the notch is bigger than necessary is so later when they introduce FaceID to the Mac, the size of the notch won&#39;t have to change size. It&#39;s getting people used to that form factor.
Face ID on a MacBook with Apple fighting privacy issues? I doubt it. Who would want their webcam on all the time?

I wonder how the guys at Apple be feeling like when making these powerful machines...&quot;they&#39;ll love this Jimmy&quot;
UHS-3? I didn’t even know there was a UHS-3 now. I can’t really find much info on it with a google search. This must be beyond what I could ever need with my simple little Fuji X-T4.
„Top notch design“ 😁 nice!
Nice
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=05m11s">05:11</a> he meant AMP,  right?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m05s">17:05</a> It loads so fast he didn’t even have time to notice the typo (should be M1 Max)
logan paul music
Everyone loves to say Apple is always lagging behind, but what they’re doing with their own chips is surely the counter-example to that. I’m sure one of you will argue the point anyway, though. Go ahead.
MKBHD : “Not sure why they are not give SPACE GREY connector”<br>Apple : “We dont do that here”
Leave it to Apple to give us all ports and skimp on the versions
I hope apple would continue moving in the right direction
Max Tech did a bunch of video comparisons between the M1 pro vs M1 Max, 14 vs 16 inch, 16 GB vs 32 GB, etc! I definitely recommend their videos on the new laptops as well!
Marques having to be an ass and drop this at basically midnight knowing I have to watch this anyways
Imagine the M1 Ultra in the next Mac Pro <br>28 core CPU, 128 Core GPU, 1Tb of integrated RAM 🤯💪🏽
I feel adding ethernet port to charger in  laptop is not a good idea because then you need to keep your charger plugged in. And when the battery becomes fully charged, many users will accidentally disconnect from charger only to find that their internet is also gone. Just a small annoyance. For iMac this works as they are always plugged in.
Does anyone know how the battery life on the 14inch m1 max is supposed to be like? I configured mine with 32 gigs of ram and m1 max with 32 GPU cores, and on a day of battery with around 10 crhome tabs open and like discord and spotify, I only ever reach around 5-6 hours. Is this normal? Thanks!
I wonder why they didn’t add the touch functionality to the top of the screen to keep something reminiscent to what the keyboard could do
M1 Mac Pro will break Marques! 😂
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a>, I think the last one should say m1 max mbp instead of m1 pro mbp
Yes, Finally!
Intel is crying in the corner lol
Can’t wait for mine to come in, its delivery got pushed back to mid November, but I really hope it comes earlier! 💯✔️🔥
I saw the Apple event and immediately sold my maxed out 2018 MBP 15&quot;  to get the 14&quot; M1 pro I am blown away 💯🙌🏽💪🏽
some of what this tells me, is just how awful the previous macbooks really were.
Nadine be like : watching this probably

Holy cow, now Im more excited for my full spec out 14&quot; <br>Great Review!!!
I wear socks and sandals all the time - you&#39;re just behind the trends, Marques.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m10s">17:10</a> typo on the screen. The bottom label should be M1 Max MBP.
MAX MAX MAX SUPER MAX
So i want to buy a new iPhone, but dont know whether it should be the iPhone XR or iPhone 11. Is the XR still worth it in 2021 and should I be worried about iOS-support in the future?
Two users at my company have 2020 13&quot; M1&#39;s. So many freaking problems. Both have issues displaying 5k, one has wifi that constantly disconnects, the other was overheating... Both are from the Apple store.
Amazing comments and point of view as always!
Does it have Wifi 6?<br>IMO, Apple should have gone another route -- I am network engineer and a part time dev. I would loved to see a chip where it has say 4 GPU Cores but option to increase the Performance Core to Say 28(or whatever is possible by the lithography and chip design) by reducing the GPU cores.

There are people out there not going to buy just because of the notch.


all that power while editing the video and my mac stuggles to open chrome lol. GIVEAWAY PLEASE
Truly next level pricing more like
The craziest thing about all of this to me is not only the performance but the energy efficiency. Clearly the M1 is actually quite scalable and I&#39;ll be curious to see if they continue to scale it up one more time before the inevitable M2 hits the scene.
I don&#39;t know how all these people are okay with a useless obstruction on the top of the screen built purely for nonsensical branding and design aesthetics.
The money at which it is priced is also “next level”

I feel like this is the first time apple did something right
Socks and sandals shots fired 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Just joking 🙂🙂
Those exporting stats are unbelievable
That suitcase made me lol, it also made me realize why I love your content.
Apple should now just give the contract for ads to Marques
ok I think this has to do with logistics. So they engineered and ordered screens with notch so that if they are planning on FaceID on macbook then they can integrate it easily and take advantage of economy of scale and is easier overall
Apple finally competes with the MacBook
shouldn&#39;t the last one be M1 Max MBP at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a> ?
i waited to watch this review about the new macbook pros on a new macbook pro
Other Youtubers should learn from him on how to explain a product in detail. No BS, and to the point. Awesome ❤️❤️
Your intro is cinematic level amazing
“Top notch design” Get it? Top notch… 😃  😐
Saying you can ignore the notch is like you can live with a monitor with dead pixels. <br>Even 1 dead pixel is unacceptable
What an exciting time to be alive
I was waiting for this, waiting like I’m waiting for my Max Maxed Out.
I have an Asus laptop (i3 8th Gen, 8 GB Ram) should I upgrade?
I believe the invention of Apple&#39;s M1 will go down in history as one of the best things that happened to computers.


I’ve waited for this exact review. And yes I’m crying cuz I wish I own one.
The long awaited review of the year 👏👏👏
Apple blew it out of the water
the most awaited review
What if apple removed all those ports because they knew they&#39;ll release m1 MacBook pros and this could be a reason that the pros upgrade.
I&#39;m sorry to be doing this, but seems like i have to.<br>As always the information is top notch, but my issue is that lately there seems to be drop in the quality of the shots visually, little unsettling things.. the loose handheld shots seems a bit too much and i used to love the framing of products in Marques&#39;s videos, now not as much. Little things like the shot @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m52s">3:52</a> doesn&#39;t seem to match the color grade or shots @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m20s">1:20</a> or @ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m15s">2:15</a> lack the mkbhd signature professional style, and a seems a lazy choice.<br>Honestly i wouldn&#39;t care if it was any other tech channel but this is MK freakin BHD.. it&#39;s one of those channels you play for top quality information and randomly play his videos to show of your new 4K TV to your relatives and friends.. because his quality of videos used to be that great. Now i play and think, &quot;Really|? They chose that shot?? Looks awful.. even though they were shot on RED cameras&quot;<br>I hope it&#39;s not just me.. and i hope Marques get to see this.. I love his channel, everybody remotely interested in tech do. Something i had to bring up.<br>@marques brownlee
Thank u so much for the time stamps bro 😎
Great Review! Well worth the wait.  To get 64GB RAM, you will need to get the M1 Max.  I am a cloud architect/developer.  The M1 Max/M1 Pro benchmark results using XCode, VMs, and other tools crush a 2019 MBP 16&quot; i9 2.4/64 GB.  It destroys it without needing to turn on the fans and while using very little battery.  Apple&#39;s crazy SSD pricing is the only thing that I dislike.  The limitation of only having a 2 TB SSD in my 2019 MBP 16&quot; killed my workflow on a project.  The crazy price to jump to a 4 TB SSD really stinks.  Win11 ARM running in a Parallel VMs seems to handle my Windows needs. (Certain PowerBI\Azure apps only run in Windows :( )  I usually travel with a Windows and MacBook.  This could be my one device to cover anything thing that I need to do for my clients.  Unfortunately, it seems to have really killed the resell value of my 2019 MBP 16&quot;....
I&#39;m using a 2020 13inch M1 Macbook Pro. It&#39;s a great tool to make my job done. But Mac Pro &amp; Max are really on another level.
That notch is RIDICULOUS, they must have a seriously OCD design boss at Apple that just can&#39;t let go.
Scary fast
looks like Indians do have a mind on what needs to be added to the MacBook. like everybody at apple did a great job in adding the ports for pro users
But can you plug in usb 2.0?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m27s">16:27</a> I&#39;m sorry did you just say you have 768GB of Ram casually on ur Mac pro 😭🥺

I’ve been waiting for MKBHD review for so long yet I can’t even afford any of these laptop 💻
The last 4 years worth of macbook pros are complete fail
Any chance you could mine bitcoin with any effectiveness?

Starting music from Logan Paul&#39;s Japan Vlog.
I like how Marques used <b>Maxed out 16 inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max</b> as a stage for the 14 inch.
I legitimately swiped on my screen during the intro (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m17s">0:17</a>) thinking there was a bug on it 😂
So you telling me this small boi beat the 50k mac pro. DAYUM.
he he &quot;top notch&quot;
You know whats funny? I really want the 14 mid model ($2499) but my current macbook pro does everything I need it to perfectly fine 😂 (2020 Four Thunderbolt 3 ports 2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 16gb ram)
Happy Diwali to legend MKBHD 🎉🎉
me who just edits some school documents and watch YouTube all day: yes i need that performance













































































































Just won 1000 bet on FD so I’m getting it next week
I&#39;m surprised that the MacBook Pro 16 inch is faster than a 28 Core Mac Pro in rendering on FCPX
THEY MADE THESE MACHINES SPECIFICALLY FOR MARQUES lol
Next year,<br>Shorts and Sandals Review: Truly Next Level!
almost makes me wish i had a job.
Top review Marques! The waiting was totally worth it.
Production Quality is dope.
<b>RIP touchbar.</b> I actually miss it coming from a 2015 15&quot; MBP
Apple finally learned there lesson to make their laptops thicker. 😬😬😬
Does anyone know about the machine learning performance of M1 Max MBP?
Excuse me, you have a Mac with 768gb of RAM? Please explain the how and why of that.

We will remember the socks and sandals.😂
waiting for next year for him to wear socks and sandles
Wait wasn’t it m1 max macbook pro: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a> ?
I’ll go tell Linus
the design looks like we back in 2013, looks bulky
Can not wait for the iMac 27&quot; M1






Finally
Unsure if I should buy one. I don’t use anything high power but I like the screen etc. Maybe I’ll wait for an Air? Upgrading from a 2015 MacBook 12” lol
Hey Mark thank you for the video but you forget to mention the price
Hear hear on the ethernet! C’mon Apple! 😂
I’ve been a follower of your channel from a long time. Since I have been following your channel your intro’s are getting better. Great work on that. The video quality is very crisp, would like to know which camera you use to make these video’s. Also, do you still use mac pro and XDR display? Really appreciate your work. Keep up the work!
Bro. 768GB of RAM. Thats in one computer?
The travel iMac is the first thing that sprang into my mind when I saw you on Twitter talking about the efficiency and performance these new MacBooks bring lol. These are truly next level laptops that they can beat the Mac Pro in some situations while being completely silent
I&#39;m about to throw my HP in the ocean. You can have it Mr.krabs
You should do a video about your favorites of the year!!
Can AI and ML programs leverage the extra GPU’s on the M1 max or is the M1 pro good enough. Which of these two laptop’s and the configuration is useful for an AI and ML developer.
Those hands are huuuge
Remember that old Mac Book review by Casey Neistat?
Why did no one noticed GROOT dancing 🕺
The 16inch base model MacBook Pro is the best value high end laptop if you dont mind a slightly bigger size. It has great sound, battery life, big beautiful immersive display, great touchpad, great keyboard and is really fast even unplugged. Its hard to procrastinate work wherever you are once you&#39;re carrying this laptop because its like a mobile desktop without compromises which you&#39;re carrying.
You are a broker of apple inc.

You are nitpicking and biased I win bye bye
a lot of vids out reviewing it but this is the one we’ve all been waiting for
Title should have been &quot;New MacBook Pro : One less Dongle&quot;
Did he say his Mac has 700g of RAM?
DAMN THE PROD QUALITY. 😍😎👌👌👌👌
This is the first ever Apple product I&#39;m actually coveting. :/

please do a review on how it handles the engineering simulation software
Would you recommend it for gaming. My basic requirement is around 100 fps without thermal issues so can this be MacBook that can finally do that?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=19m22s">19:22</a> lol this guy is really trying to get his company to get him a new laptop
Thank you 🙏
&quot;Like Linus&quot; 🤣🤣
Yep  this is Apple level advertising 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥

can we talk abt  the life of the device (not battery capacity... just how many years or so we can use stuff) its smtg important which isn&#39;t covered in many reviews. of course in this fast moving sector they don&#39;t have time to keep using the same device for such a long time, but probably something which should be considered as we don&#39;t keep changing our devices regularly and use the same one for many years.
I love how you&#39;re bragging about the MacBook speed, while holding up a Pixel 6. I feel that, as I sit here watching you on my m1 MacBook Air, while I scroll on my Pixel 4a.
please pin me
First look thought mi product rather mac
still prefer gaming laptop than this.
Sometimes I think how can be your contents free of cost
21;16 No you cant match 16 inch and 14 inch specs. There is no Max on 14.
You know hot good it actually is the moment you read the title💯<br>It ain&#39;t easy getting that from the creator of the decade..
laptops absolutely still need USB A ports. And onboard ethernet, i would personally hate a power brick ethernet on a laptop. sometimes i just wanna do a fast file transfer for a couple mins and wouldn&#39;t wanna have to grab my power adapter to do that
The new 12th gen Intel chips beat the M1 Max

Last year I got a MBA M1 with the intention of using it until the MBPs &quot;M1X&quot; came out. A year later I basically haven&#39;t hit a point where I wish it was faster so I&#39;m just going to stick with it and enjoy the light weight and no fan. The new MBPs do look awesome, I just don&#39;t think I need the power.















Is it good for Cinema 4D ❓
“I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day!”<br><br>WOW! High stakes! :-) No promise to shave off eyebrows or beard?! ;-)

Intro was lit
Two pet peeves that stop it being the perfect MBP. No clips on the power brick for built in cable management. No single USB-A port to complete that port story.
i really cant use a laptop with a notch. I hate them on the phones too. I hope this doesn&#39;t become the trend now
What? HDMI 2, shame on you apple
Wait for Alder Lake-P&#39;s arrival.
“It’s the worlds most powerful laptop ever” and yet runs 30 hz in gaming

that&#39;s a thicc boy
DT 770 250 Ohm owner here 👍
768gb of ram? em...
Extremely excited for mine to arrive next week…$5k beast
&quot;Three minutes forty-nine seconds. Jesus.&quot;  Killed me. These are truly insane.


Is it my PC or its the video? I can notice some frame drops while watching the video....
Damn, that CPU is nipping on the heels of my desktop&#39;s 5800X. In a laptop. At less than 90w.
Are the displays native 10-bit, or 8-bit + FRC? Thanks!
Stop swearing, Marques.
We know, apple silicon is beast, but almost everything are running in x86, for now, x86-64 isnt going to die soon, and intel and amd knew they need to update their x86
That intro tho!!
I hope someday macbooks come with sim slot for email check on the go without the need to log into unknown networks… internet with that much battery life.. might be awsome to say the least..
Terrific review - great job Marques. If only I needed one…
Socks and Sandals like Linus for a Day.....<br><br><br>APPLE TIS IN YOUR HANDS
Your intro music remains unmatched
I’ll accept your retired iMac, take it off your hands don’t worry.
How much hot does it get with extensive usage? Is the 16 inch heavy or can be classified as portable?
Now everyone will start posting reviews, and no one was since MKBHD didn&#39;t do it just yet!
Now I just want intel to release a M1 Max competitor and that too for laptop , just think that windows computer user&#39;s like me would just love it.<br>I edit in Primere Pro on 3 year old intel core i7 8 gen which has 16 cores and 32 threads and that too with just 8 gb ram and i have edit in 4k always (My laptop&#39;s screen is touch as well as 4k oled) My friend has a MacBook Pro and i hate the touchbar  , My laptop&#39;s touchscreen is a lot more comfortable than MacBooks touchbar.
The new MacBook Pro looks and feels cheap.  My Mid 2015 Mac book pro feels and looks better.  I know the guts of the new MacBook Pro is much better, but for as much as you pay for these devices, I wish they will feel and look more premium
Wow! The Pro and Max MacBooks seem to be the biggest single year leap I’ve ever seen in any technological device ever and that’s on top of how big an improvement the 2020 M1 was over Intel. I hope one day I can buy this as it brings the best of my 15 inch mid 2014 i7 MBP (Ports, larger screen, larger speakers, MagSafe) and the best of my 2020 M1 13 inch MBP (Massive leap in performance, no fan noise, having to go a day or even two without plugging it in)
I wear socks with sandals all the time
I got the last intel MacBook and this looks so nice 😭😭
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m04s">18:04</a> This is how you know apple wasn&#39;t Joking Around About The power of m1
Finally, the review we all waited for.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m26s">1:26</a> wait a minute, that pcb with lights behind the macbook is sick.
The notch is probably Apple getting their supply chain ready for the next few years of MacBooks
Whoever shoots and edits these intros (very possibly marques) needs to be making a lot of money
Is this a max m1 max?
So you and YourAvgConsumer share offices?? Yeahhhh
His BUT really sounds like a lot of twist is going on.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m17s">20:17</a> 2021 macbook pro review in 2 second 😁😁😁
Wowza, that&#39;s awesome! Seeing the footage of you editing in Final Cut Pro was pretty cool, btw IMO. I still have not tried Final Cut &amp; it looked seriously interesting 😃 Great review 🖖🏽
&quot;Top notch&quot; get it?<br><br>😁
Finally!
How does apple offer 96w to their laptops &amp; 27w to the iPhone?! 🤷‍♂️
The way that you explain everything is simply the best. Congratulations.
What will happen when they put this chip in a Mac Pro
I think one of the main things we all miss when looking at these new MacBooks is that Jony Ive&#39;s departure. I think there ports only came back after the change in the guard and Apple finally giving in function-over-design. The iPhone got slightly thicker to get more battery, now we have a pro laptop with ports.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a> RIP Mac Pro resale values
Another awesome video! ❤️❤️ Am investing my time and money in crypto now, this new price is a clear sign for new investors to come in ✅✅....















Bottom line I got out of this: if you can write this off as a work related expense you’re good. Otherwise, you don’t truly neeeeed it
How many chrome tabs we talkin?
Fkin expensive 🤕
For the first time, I hope not the last time I&#39;ve watched a review of a product in your channel while using the product.<br>That was a next level fully maxed out review Marques! (Clap!)<br>@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m17s">20:17</a> that Ummah! &lt;3
I still don&#39;t understand why people are so obsessed with apple products no matter how expensive it is.
But bad pricing


There is a small something on the back wall around Marques&#39; head that kept annoying me and made me recheck my screen for dead pixels.
Awesome &amp; Thanks :)
Patiently waiting for a new Mac mini M1 pro / max
Really irritates me that they’re purposely supplying lower tier HDMI and SD card slots, just so they can say LOOK USB C DONGLES ARE BETTER ANYWAYS
iMKBHD. Everything Apple makes is perfect.<br>Everyone else? Meh.
“Probably doesn’t apply to you poor people.”
Worst
In Productive Purpose this is Beast Laptop Ever!
I can’t even afford 2012 macbook
Ajkal koi matlub nahi hai in sab ko delhne ka pata hai is saal m1 se 200 %improved hai agla wala issse 3 gunna powerfull hoga its better too improve our skill rather than spending lac onthese machine every year....and all know spect never satisfied the user completely even it one of the most powerful machnice at present...and future changes every 12 month...so thing wisly...
Great MBP review, but what I really want to know is what skin/case you&#39;re using on that Pixel 6P... Loving that white lower with the stormy black upper 👌
Pixel ... Daily driver?
I don&#39;t do any serious video or audio work, just the occasional home video on imovie or audacity. But I&#39;m considering these because I think it&#39;ll last a lot longer. I bought my current 13in MacBook pro retina in 2014, and though it was way overpowered for the kind of work I needed to do at the time (a MacBook air would have done fine), the upgrade has meant great performance even 7 years on, with maybe even 3 years to go. All my previous expensive PCs only lasted 3 years before becoming unbearably laggy. <br>So I&#39;m willing to spend extra for an unnecessarily overpowered computer to get that longevity. Literally the only thing stopping me is the lack of a normal USB port. My current MacBook has 3 old USB ports and I will miss the hell out of them, even if the tech world has moved on.
Maybe that charger being the wrong color is related to supply chain issues.
The only MacBook Pro review we need!
A person who carries his iMac while traveling. Today I finally understand why nothing makes you fully happy. 😂
I still don&#39;t understand why they had to add this stupid notch. I feel like I see laptops all the time that have the same bezel on the rest of the apple ones but they go the same width all the way around, no? Anyway, they do look amazing besides that hideous thing.
Can you add a digital sim to the laptop for cellular data on the go?
Please make a vid on the beats fit pro!
That is clean
The mac of dreams!!! 🤩
That intro! 🔥🔥🔥
Why doesnt he reviews high end windows counterparts ? why only Apple macbooks? why dont you review galaxy tablets? why only ipad pros? <br>Can you give equal priority to every tech, even if you dont like do it for &quot;viewer&#39;s sake&quot; <br>and oh, not everybody in the world only does video editing?
A whole studio in your bag
I’m really hoping to see these in Mac mini’s.
Man I&#39;m so excited to get mine. This is a game changer for Final Cut!
Love Groot 🌴
Ewww ugly notch I just can&#39;t get over it
An actual MacBook Pro.
Now Apple websites only have 16 32 gb ones and only upto 1tb options,more storage versions are not available
Where did you get that GROOT plant in the background??
S K I N  O I L S
Buy mac mini or move to windows laptop
Stealing a comment from Reddit about why HDMI 2.0 instead of 2.1: Completely a bandwidth based decision.<br>There are almost certainly 4 TB4/PCIe4 channels. The fourth one is likely split between the SD card and the HDMI port (and perhaps a couple other peripherals, we&#39;ll have to see what System Information says next week). HDMI 2.1 utilizes up to 48Gb, TB4 has a 40Gb channel. You do the math. Even with the SD card using only a lane or two, a lot of the HDMI 2.1 benefits wouldn&#39;t be there.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m19s">17:19</a><br>The only fact here is the Mac Pro is  Ridiculously over priced and his performance is laptop level<br>😒😒😒😒😒<br>One more fact for free i am not buying any apple performance marketing &quot;LIES&quot; anymore
Remember when “pro” actually meant pro and you didn’t need to add a “max” on it?
I wish I could afford it I got a M1 MacBook Air tho
BIGGER THAN THE SUPER BOWL, MY HYPE FOR THIS VIDEO
haha productivity = cut videos？ plus prores is ASIC acceralated
I think that the notch is ironically, intelligently resolved. I mean if you really think about, it, it disappears by turning the entire top bar black. Reverting the screen back to its old roots. It’s not  noticeable when your using an application or playing a game.<br><br>It’s almost like they are trying to remind you about their position on “PRIVACY”. To remind you that there is a camera up there in case it slips your mind.
The cheapest 13inch MBP is 1650 dollars(India). Air is 1250. so unless u are a SERIOUS content creator, its is not worth it. air is already super fast. In India though, apple is still useless lol.
I&#39;m guessing the HDMI/SD card reader limitation are just there to give them an easy spec to bump up next generation.

All I want in my laptops (and phones) are expandable memory, card reader, no ugly notches or hole punch cameras, flat OLED screens, headphone jack, cd/DVD player, USB port... apparently that&#39;s too much to ask when they&#39;re asking for me to pay $2k+
The review we&#39;ve been waiting. And you delivered perfectly 🙌🏻
This video is sponsored by the verge
Why does it seem like tech youtubers are only reviewing appl products? I want to see all tech not just apple
Damn damn good laptops. The 16&quot; M1 Pro base model is the sweet spot, IMO. I opened every program on my dock, played a Logic project with plenty of effects and opened and ran X-Plane at full panel resolution.. Not a hiccup.


Apple next year: You now have 80% faster speed on the inbuilt sd card reader.<br><br>Apple fans: Wooooowwwww<br><br>Apple next year: You now get the best HDMI technology ever on a MacBook pro.<br><br>Apple fans: Wooooooowwwwwwww
Is the base model good enough to handle Minecraft?
How expensive are these? Genuinely wondering
I think apple added the notch just so it would justify the phone notch. its now a design choice and not a compromise
I love his editing, very simple yet elegant 👍👍👍.
Way too out of budget
Steve Jobs DID say that computers should just work like magic. I think this laptop qualifies. Apple is on 🔥
Can u give a quick update on like students and buying an M1 vs m1pro i want the ports and everything but i also want to save money also if it is worth getting 16 gb or ram vs 8. Thanks
I appreciate the fact that you have baby Groot on your left side 😍😍
The long awaited review is here!
Didn&#39;t the ifixit teardown already come out?
Technology finally caught up to Marques!
Finally a treat for endless scrolling.
Apple Boi 🍏
Did he say he has 768 gigs of RAM on his Mac Pro?
I think Apple has conditioned me to think thinner is better because I’m completely turned off by the overall design of this machine.
Insane. Which m1 pro configuration did you have?
How did he get the pixel 6 white with the top grey/black ?
Marques do you recommend getting the 8tb drive and edit in final cut straight in the machine? I have the 1tb and I am thinking of upgrading to the 8tb and not having to worry about carrying another drive around....

It’s top notch design
Awaited review!
Bravo Apple for delivering 5 years over due
In the end you still cant game on it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Huge annoyance is, even with the increase in thickness, there&#39;s no USB 2.0 port
Great review as always. Wish you had gone there with gaming just to see if it is workable. Some of us want a work machine with workable if not stellar gaming in one machine and recent reviews show some titles perform much better on the M1. Cheers! Keep up the strong work.


Very nice to see a good review of something I cannot afford☺☺
We waited for ages!
Can you game on these
A new “top notch design.”  😂😂😂
Hi, i am a designer and use a lot Illustrator, Indesign, Figma, Adobe XD, etc... so in the 14 inch mac what processor you recommend and how much ram, 16 or 32?





MKBHD on the 1080p webcam &quot;Thanks for catching up Apple&quot;- how many Windows laptops have 1080p webcams? Who are they catching up to? The Surface Book?
Ahhh yesss ive been waiting forever 😂
Added ports that have been around for 10 years<br><br>Poggers
Legend and G.O.A.T.
Let’s go Brandon
There&#39;s a notch??
Very nice laptop with very nice price.only for pros
I wouldn&#39;t buy anything from a company that is fighting against the Right to Repair Bills. Screw Apple.
It&#39;s not very often we get something truly next level. Like when Emmure upgraded to 9 string guitar, truly next level.

22mins? Really?
I can’t wait to get a MacBook Pro, that would be so awesome
Can we take a sec to admire the intro? That was fire!!!
Getting rid of Intel, helped Mac return to the better glory days.
Top notch 😂😂
So it&#39;s better than me 7 4800H. Duhhh
Have you experienced the playing 4k HDR video in default viewer mode on youtube and scrolling on that same page to activate the kernel panic yet? I can get it to freeze / restart every time I try it on my M1 Max
Oh that is so cool , but I don&#39;t have money to buy this shit
Literally the &#39;top&#39; &#39;notch&#39; design..... Get it? 😎
Perfection ❤️
Thanks Marques We&#39;ve been waiting for Your post all week....
MKBHD - great video sold me on the 32 vs 64 and using as a “tool” 10-16 hours per day….but sad on the port’s(s) tech as why not be at or better create the next HDMI, card reader and more?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m41s">1:41</a> “So these laptops have a new <b>top-notch</b> design”<br><br>I think this is one of the best puns I’ve ever seen lmao
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a> Man 768Gb of RAM 😳, oh common man! who does that I suspect even a small to medium IT company doesn&#39;t have that amount of RAM their servers.<br>This is next level bro 😂
The first time I used the SD card reader I almost shed a single tear 😭🙏🏼
I had the same thought, how fast will the Mac Pro be with silicon chip? It’ll be wild, perfect for home officing nowadays and beyond!
just bought a m1 max today and I love it
Well worth the wait! Auto like 👍🏻
so in one year you can buy a used mac pro worth thousands of dollar at much cheaper
Wait its so genius and hilarious that he would travel with his iMac
Can anyone tell me if direct HDR editing can be done on Final Cut Pro?
Finally!
These macs so good Tim Cook said we have to dial it back a &quot;notch&quot;
Bro heart please!😂👌
The 2027 MacBook
PCs hAvE cHeApEr AnD fAsTeR hArDwArE!!!
Working on my 14 inch max, I am pretty confident I can continue to work remotely all day with my small power bank attached and have full desktop level performance sitting in a cafe. In fact i did not even carry my Macbook charger today, lol!
got me a zephyrus g15, 5900HS and 3060 - im jealous of these new macs buuuuuuut... games.. and portable VR setup - mad laptops though this is insane and if X86 emulation is good enough.....
The fact that the apple logo wasn&#39;t inside the &quot;0&quot; in the intro is killing me





After constantly Refreshing my feed..... For almost 2 weeks.... It&#39;s finally here!!!!!
will the screens scratch easily ?
Since it&#39;s MKBHD, I thought he will review the M1 Mac 16 Max.<br>But you know he is MKBHD. Seriously Impressive.
can we please get these tshirts to amazon i really wanna get one it looks so cool...it&#39;ll be lil more expensive in india but I&#39;ll still get a bunch of them!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m30s">16:30</a> 760gb of ram🙄. <br>That&#39;s called flexing
watching this on my first ever MacBook Pro I just bought from Costco, I promise I cried at the register I was so happy
Dude that “beard” looks so stupid, just shave it bro…
Thanks for including the 28-CORE Mac Pro export time @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m39s">16:39</a>. I couldn&#39;t find any reviews that included this so right on!
Hehe amazing.
Tech...Funny thing is  XSatanX  is bringing life to A.I. the image of  XSatanX  &amp; Man keeps helping lol.
I wish I wasn’t poor
You’re video is like a fucking movie
Hey, at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m04s">17:04</a>, should the last line be &quot;M1 Max MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>&quot;?
Question: Buy this or wait for the mac pro desktop ?
I you don’t need the 🖥 anymore please donate it to me. 🙏🙏🙏
l love this 💗💗
I want to DBrand Case for these powerful Laptops 😍😍😍😍
Is it possible to learn this power?
You didn’t talk about the graphical performance
I was actually laughing by the end of the video from astonishment, these machines are unbelievable!!! Great review, worth the wait!
I guess next year Apple will release high impedance headphones 🎧 to take advantage of this port or next version of Apple headphone will have option to connect to this high impedance port then if there is good customer response….. IPhone and iPad may get high impedance headphone port… so Apple can sell premium price headphones.
My macbook pro 15&quot; base model from 2014 is still my favorite device to use. However, half the ports are not working, the charger cable looks like a dog shewed on it and the batteries are swelling up.
Finally your review
Is it just me who thought there were flies on the computer in the intro😂😂
but it can&#39;t play some games on steam...

😳
now the world can live in peace with apple m1 chip, we need to get rid of intel and amd from the market
😍
❤️
Man could have made a better itx build than that mac... shows how tech savvy he actually is...
Wait, did you just call ATH-M50x a normal headphone? And I was daily driving it for 5 years because it gave me an impression that it is a high impedence cans unlike the more expensive Beats. What about Verum One? It&#39;s a super high end headphone but it only needs 8 ohms. Is it high impedence too?
Mind blowing laptop and mind blowing review Marques 👍
Well I am also Definitely Going to miss the Touch Bar 😅😅 I guess I am in the minority club on this one like you are 😂
So you are making content about your content?
The  2 week wait is becoming the longest two weeks ever😪
Junejo army🤝
It is  dream for me to get this laptop. 🥺😊
So is the Mac Pro even relevant anymore? Can’t wait to see the next Mac Pro with an M1 chip (M1X maybe?)!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=13m23s">13:23</a> using one macbook as a stand for other is the most MKBHD thing 😂
iPhone 14 pro max will have the M1 chips
768 gb ram?
Game changer!
That intro 💥❤️
The moment we have all been waiting for!
Intel is running like never before. This is laptop is a game changer. Here in Brazil you can buy a house with the actual price
M1 max battery life would be much better than imac pro 🤣
Apple is just fucking killing it and making huge leaps this year it’s insane. People have their opinions of the company and it’s history, but there is undeniable growth and progress within the company every single year. So so so impressive
I am so glad they brought back the SD Card slot
I can&#39;t take this laptop serious with that weird notch. It was unnecessary, this guy is just promoting that bad design and want us to forget that notch.  ...that&#39;s a bad design... probably the worst ever on a modern laptop.
High impedance headphones require more voltage not more power.
Dropping 2% of battery is insane.
May I just add the intro was absolutely epic
who can see baby groot in the background
Apple Working towards Less Dongle is quite an Irony 😏😏😏😏
Impedance and ohms are related to resistance not power..
now whats really the difference between this and the laptop that existed before the touchbar version of Macbooks? Man, this is a brand losing its luster and thats because that type of thinking is unsustainable, incessant innovation can take the opposite toll and make things garbage, yet the proponents of such a system are unsilenceable.
Is M1 Max vs Mx Pro performance worth the price?
That B- Roll❤️❤️
Wearing socks and sandals like linus. 😂 😂 😂
I haven’t watched any reviews on the new macbook pros because i was waiting for this 🙏
OH MY GOD OKAY ITS HAPPENING, EVERYBODY STAY CALM
The intro is next level!!
Single core performance is a big lead from Apple previous version.<br><br>But it is still far from the leading AMD chip that has 2- 3x the raw power of multi core.<br><br>Anyone chasing this &quot;new&quot; design should go to Apple refurbished section.<br>Since apple has removed the reviews of its products, the only anyone can tell if the product is &quot;good&quot;<br><br>M1 products has a significant presence in the refurbished section, many users have returned the M1 products due to one reason or another.<br>Apple marketing at its finest.<br><br>With apple facing a class action lawsuit, those cash strapped or are not tech youtubers...should refrain from purchasing till at least 2 yrs.<br><br>Apple tool 6 yrs to repair a faulty keyboard design.<br>With this &quot;new&quot; design....i wish all apple users the best of luck to claim warranty ..<br>At least if you are in the USA you can make a class action lawsuit eh
apple m1 chip is the future, intel and amd has lost the battle, just give up intel and amd fans, pathetic!!!
I have a notch on my monitor where my webcam sits and people are complaining about a notch??
Apple will be better in games tpo in a few years
I&#39;m waiting for the socks and sandals dedicated video
I&#39;ve always thought that high impedance is easier to drive than low. Say a 4 ohm loudspeaker requires more current than a 8 or 16 ohm one. Maybe headphones are weird. Am I missing something?

Actually, the chassis is thick enough to fit an ethernet port, so it wouldn&#39;t have to be on the power brick.
Jesus Loves Us.
I may have ordered one this afternoon before seeing this so here’s to hoping it was the right decision. <br>Got a 14” Max
Apple makes the best computers period
When is the pixel 6 pro review coming?
your pixel 6 pro  is with different two tone🤣🤣 Is it a engineering model?!🤩🤩
Like Linus hauauuaya
Lp
Hahaha such apple fan boy carrying Mac.  Also Mac only useful for YOUTUBERS.
If anyone knows about this. In Mkbhd videos when he is showing himself using the laptop his cursor moments and all look very good almost real time in sync with rest of the video, but when some other youtubers do the same, their cursor moments, screen transitions look very laggy as compared to the rest of the video. Is it coz of a camera? Or video editing? Or something else
Kept trying to remove a smudge from the screen beside your head and I’m an idiot.
Finally 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
I AM HYPED<br>LETS DO THIS
That weird grey thing next to his head, makes me think there&#39;s a smudge on my phone screen.
Techies hates apple for certain things but use apple products every day 😄😄😄🤪
That intro tho!! how do u do  ur editing?
I usually lower the resolution to save data because the rates here is expensive here but for MKBHD i got to keep it crispy.
What for do you need your $43,000 Mac Pro now?
we all love watching stuff we can&#39;t afford ):
Carrying your iMac while travelling was actually mind blowing ✌️
I was waiting anxiously for your review and you did not disappoint at all MKBHD! A lot of reviews were driven by benchmarks and over testing the specs. Your production and review was really heads above others. <br><br>Great review! 👍🏻
New “top notch” design… you get it cuz of the notch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a>
Amazinnnng review ✨
Great review!
You don&#39;t want Ethernet on the power brick. Or else you will have to keep your laptop connected to power all the time and that would consume battery cycles lot faster &amp; degrade battery performance in a very short span of time
&quot;Top notch design.&quot; <br><br>Well played sir, well played.


If only they came in matte black.
768 GB Ram!
5 thousand dollars..
&quot;Top Notch&quot; lol
It’s exciting to see how much power they are packing into smaller form factors, I feel like I am currently living in the future 🚀. The base M1 is more than sufficient for the simple video editing and affinity designer stuff I do so I’ll  keep it for a few years and be totally happy watching these reviews!







Watching new macbook&#39;s review on my new macbook. Yay...
<b>Waiting for Windows Users to Complain here about Gaming</b>   LOL......😂😂😂😂😂😂
Been waiting for this one ! Great video Marques 👏
I know they like to highlight the notch as a feature but not making their programs black to hide the notch is a silly move IMO. Not having face ID seems like a bit of a p***-take too tbh. Great in all other aspects...
The intros are like my inspiration to always click
@Marques They don&#39;t have any new design thats why they just rotate the designs. It is looking like their old Macbook, Also it looks ugly, from Clean and finished design they went for ugly design. I know it will increase the usability. Lower panel is looking like typical Windows laptop design.
The reason for the older ports is for them to release the newer ones next year.
One of my dream to own one, yet the only way to have one, if i win a giveaway from u.
Not gonna lie, I love my M1 air with only  thunderbolt ports. I think the air should maybe stick with the sleek design and the pro be for pro users.
I&#39;m here for &quot;Mouse and The Notch&quot;.<br><br>✌️
That&#39;s and interesting color scheme you&#39;ve got on your pixel, swapped back glass? panda pixel 2 xl was the best looking phone ever. if the pixel 6 pro looked the same that would be perfect
My video editing spirit is tingling... Help
Please do the Surface Pro 8 😭
That waveform issue with Final Cut Pro seems to be something messed up in the latest update because it’s been HELL on my 2015 MacBook Pro 13, and before this version it honestly was completely bearable.
Dude you should grow a big afro. It would be epic.
🙌 🙌 🙌
When he has to say “at the end of the day they’re just tools” because they’re that good
&#39;Apple has made such a top notch design for the macbook!&#39;<br>Then I woke up.
I wish macs could do more stuff. Sucks that if you&#39;re a gamer then you&#39;d still have to get a windows computer to play almost 90% of games. Would you rather have 1 machine that does everything decently or two machines where one does a few things amazingly and the other does the rest?
but can it game
Ah yes 768gb of ram. That’s normal.
Finally all my questions answered!
LIked for socks and saldal refrence.
I&#39;m curious about ray tracing for gaming on that.
Thanks for not rushing your review. The wait was worth it 👍
Should have just been pulling around the Mac Pro on a leash. I mean, it has wheels.
So you&#39;re telling me the 5000 device. Beat the 50000 device from 2 years ago. I might as well wait for the 2025 apple watch then. It will surely beat the 2019 mac pro
I’m upgrading to the 14” with a lot of upgrades from a basic hp I got in 2017… I’ve never had a mac. This laptop is going to absolutely blow my mind lol.
Yes, it is truly silly to celebrate the &quot;return of the ports&quot;. Pffft ... Apple 💰💵💸
&quot;Top notch&quot; design...ha ha great one....
Finally
LoL I thought he said <b>760GB</b> of ram
I wonder how ppl that complain about the notch use their iphones.
It is basically what Apple does when Apple = Appple - Johny Ive
Yes finally this was what I’ve been waiting for all week!
I want a Max but don’t need one but I’m not buying a Pro because it’s not a Max so I’ll stick with the iPad Pro.
Man your B-rolls are on another level
My humble request to people don&#39;t buy Mac or ipads if your are not super rich because they are not reliable laptops.<br>Have mac book pro 2019 just after 2 years i got studio light effect on display and service center said display needs to be replaced and will cost ₹48732/- approx $655.<br>And i digged more into the issue and found it happens cause of normal opening/closing of the lid and it occurs after 2-3 years in mac.<br>This is because thinner cables used inside to connect display to motherboard<br>It completely happens on its own without any physical damage<br>Think before you invest
The thing to realize w/the notch is that Apple kept a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> display *below*. They didn&#39;t carve a notch into the screen so much as they took a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> display and gave extra &quot;ears&quot; above, and put the camera in the middle of that. You don&#39;t lose any screen real estate (compared to an older MacBook Pro). You gain extra space for the menubar.
I feel like Apple will lose this game, <br>because people will not have to buy a new one until they dip it into water.<br>I think I&#39;ll be using this for at least 5 years.

I have a question. Can the M1 Macbook air 16gb of Ram handle 8k footage. Let&#39;s say in Final Cut Pro and in davinci resolve. Im NEW to the apple ecosystem. Thank you.
Ethernet on laptop brick is dumb Marques, so you want to connect back and forth to your Wifi
768 gigs of RAM, me with 8 gigs enjoying this video: :-;
I mean if you are carrying a monster of a suitcase, just to upload videos of events. Then this is the perfect product for you. But I feel that the MacBook Air is the best general purpose product.
I dont know whats more worse, carrying an imac or these thick old school looking macbook pros
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a> mislabed m1 max… been seeing this a lot lately with the reviews.
So with the notch the sceen ratio is actually higher like 16/10.5 or 16/11. Or &quot;with&quot; the notch combine, the ratio is 16/10. Can some one explain me about this?
I need a gaming laptop from apple 😐
The wonders of well-optimized hardware and software
The intro beat 😭🔥
What about the pro model
Damn, your reviews just give me goosebumps. I am really eager to get my hands on these beasts. I have been waiting for your review, before I could decide to act upon.<br>Thanks for this good detailed review. 👍🏻 Peace ✌🏻
but lois rosman still say its trash
Its my daily I wore socks and sandals since pandemic, its because the climate is hot and wore a shoes just make it worse, the socks protect my feet to keep it clean so I dont neet to wash them after I go out
I just don&#39;t like it
do gaming in these pls
Surprised you didn&#39;t bring up not 1 USB 3.0 port. Would be nice, especially with the extra thickness.
Dude finally!!!
I literally set the mood to watch this video. Took my contacts off and put my glasses on. Turned my lights down. Got a glass of water. And played this video on my new 16&quot; MacBook Pro M1 Pro
The review we&#39;ve been waiting for lmao
I think you uploaded this at 1.25 speed. Was that one purpose?
Been waiting for this video like if other reviews don&#39;t matter... Damn! My dude sure has built up his brand well in my mind at least.
As someone who is using MacBook Pro with Retina display, the new chassis design looks almost identical to me
cannot wait to have mine!
I watched the intro thrice 🔥
Way to bring up all the things that could have been better.
I’m considering buying one of these and using it in tandem with my windows PC. I just hate shopping for PC laptops and I would prefer one of these. Can someone speak to the workflow and if they do or really don’t recommend it? I do a lot of video and music work,

They shouldn’t made the notch bigger and add face id censors this year. It such an expensive laptop anyway.
im sorry but laptop notch is where the line should be drawn
Finally, I’ve been waiting for this review, the only one that counts 😂
World class performance.<br>World class prices
One less Dongle 🤌🏻
Great opening
768GB OF RAM WHAT ON EARTH
I find it hard to believe he still edits the videos himself.
Finally the video I’ve been waiting for🤯this are mind blowing tho!!
I think the notch is as big as it is so that it lines up with the toolbar. Can you imagine if it was a shallower notch and you got half a toolbar under it?
im gonna continue to hate on apple for how little customization and innovation there is in the iPhone, but I will continue to praise them for the macbook pro even more now.
You should stop defending the notch
I just transferred my massive 300 GB photo collection from an external SSD and my M1 Max did about 1 Gigabytes (1,000 MB) per second!!  Coming from a 2012 MBP this blew me away!  The really crazy part is that the internal SSD can do up to 5,000 MB per second and so I&#39;m not even scratching the surface here!  😲







I&#39;ve been waiting for this. So satisfying to watch!!!!!!
Forget the mac. The intro is next level
The man just casually said 768GB of RAM, wtf. Even my university&#39;s computers maxed out at 128GB RAM.
Your  video animation is on the next level. 💯
if apple put ethernet on the charger it would have to go through MagSafe which is only charging and not data, and then people would complain that it isn&#39;t on the computer itself.
COOL INTRO 😁😁
I love this 💻 😍😍😍
I want one it’s been for ever since I last owned a laptop worth buying :)
Loved the Intro ,it&#39;s 🔥💥.
Even if the notch blends in after using the device for some time it still doesn’t change the fact that it’s downright ugly.
Imagine the amount of money you’ll save in baggage fees for not taking that iMac around!
ethernet port on a laptop charger doesn&#39;t make any sense. unless they intergrated a build-in wireless router
I don&#39;t see the notch as being that much of an issue 99.9% of the time, especially when the software is designed around it. I&#39;ve had a &quot;notch&quot; of sorts on my PC monitor for a year (part of the stand of my webcam covers a small part of the screen), and the only time I even notice is when I want to click on something underneath it, which is almost always just changing tabs in Chrome, and as I try to keep under 10 tabs, and Chrome previews tabs when you mouse over them, I can still tell which tab is which.
Nobody:-<br>Marques:- &quot;Top NOTCH Design&quot;
I&#39;m sorry but the notch is just disgusting... seriously gross
I went with the 10 core M1 Pro 14&quot; and it&#39;s sweet. Way more power than I need but man is it nice to have.
I love the skin on the back of your Pixel 6 Pro. Can you please make a video on it?
Cool story bro🖖🏼
specs looks good but the design? wtf....thick,square....feet on a LAPTOP ,that keyboard and the ugly black notch on the middle of the fu...ng screen ? looks like somehting from the early 2000&#39;s. fire the designer ......
Coming from an i3 2020 MBA, the baseline 14&quot; Pro feels like I&#39;m not using a laptop at all. It&#39;s absurd.
I guess the standards Apple has set for a pro machine has certainly exponentially increased with this. Others will catch up, and when the choices increase, pricing will probably be the defining factor for those who want to purchase these machines.
Any word on XCode speed improvements?
Noooo, windows Bros is not fair! Windows 11 is better is better! D E L E T E  this video right now!!!

Finally 😭😭😭😭
I have a M1 Air and all I use it for is college classes. That being said, the battery life is a game changer. I can go be on my laptop all day for studying, classes and media at night and still be above 50% the next morning. Being able to go into a class with only 15% battery and not really worry that its going to die is amazing.






































Finally
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=2m53s">2:53</a> My 2018 Ryzen 5 Lenovo has that exact SD card slot.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> Its M1 MAX MBP That did the render at 4mins and 6secs. I love this video as it was one of the most informative reviews that came out till date. Love that at least somebody made a video about that Dec that is built in this time.


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> *Max
So you’re giving away the 14” right? RIGHT?!
Beautiful intro 😯
Wow man, you really make dope videos.
better late than never... 🤷🏽‍♂️
I can’t help but having this question pops up in my head, Can TB4 support 4K / 120Hz out put? <br>Or that can be output through any TB4 hub? Maybe?
I finally got mine, and I LOVE IT! 💯👍💪
I have been waiting for this for so many days 👏
one less dongle
He&#39;s so damn close to 15 million subs
dope
U hold laptop like forehand frisbee throw
&quot;top notch design&quot;  i see
Yow imma be honest fam... The notch is unjustifiable MK it looks horrific... And ofc I&#39;ll notice 😭 it&#39;s there! I will see it 😭
finally the review we all have been waiting for. all the other tech youtubers can stfu now
I&#39;ve been curious about whether these new Macbook Pro&#39;s can partition Windows 10 through Boot Camp. I have a situation where I wanna use both a Windows and a Mac, but with these new Macbooks using the M1 chip and no longer using Intel chips, is it still possible to partition the drive to use Windows?


maybe they&#39;ll add: the better ports, more ram, 17.5 by 11 inch, and 110 (maybe 120?) watt hour battery, in a mid cycle refresh. it would go from incredible, to absurd.
Great I&#39;m from Cambodia
That&#39;s apple, always left some annoyance on their products, but still pretty good looking at the overall
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m23s"">12:23</a> &quot;that being said if the next version of
 this laptop still has a notch this big and doesn&#39;t add face id i&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like linus&quot; haha 😂"

Does anyone ever watch these videos and all you’re thinking about is how you don’t care about any of these facts and why are you still watching?

the price is indeed &quot;Truly Next Level&quot;
You don’t use natural scrolling?
It takes a lot of commitment to carry a giant case with a non-modular desktop with you when you travel for years just to stay in an ecosystem. The $2100 laptop I&#39;m on right now out performs the iMac Pro in every category but total memory and fits easily in my backpack. Apple has been ignoring their actual pro users for a very long time now.<br>This isn&#39;t to say the new Macbook Pros aren&#39;t great. They are purpose built machines for what you&#39;re doing and they will make for a great workflow. The hardware is basically purpose built for finalcut. It is just amazing that someone would tolerate having so few options for so long and stick around.
Does it game tho
Waited for this review before purchasing
Not even kidding, the macs looked better in Marques&#39;s intro than in the apple event 😅
still wish it had even just one usb-a
Finally!!!!!!
As Apple keeps on updating a huge gap in performance every 2-3 year&#39;s don&#39;t you think spending a huge ton of money in a specific device is untrustworthy. In your case, you just spent around 50,000$ on an Mac Pro and couple of years later we have a 7000$ laptop that is almost as good as this. 2 year&#39;s later, they will come with another device that would crush all these and definitely many of the professionals would switch to that. But, the regular customer&#39;s. Aren&#39;t they getting a hit here. I understand that apple do care about older gen products, But still.
I received my M1 Pro (2020) no more than 2 months ago, what a shame I didn’t wait, it looks amazing
Apple is giving us everything they took away in 2016 and charging 4K, next level
Apple gives you want you want ... but not quite up to par. Typical
“Top <b>Notch</b> Design” <br><br>hahaha
Who says I have 768 GB of RAM.....what are we in 2021? My 16GB Lenovo is crying in the corner
A notch without face id? Looks like Apple is now using the notch for branding. Also makes it clear that the iphone notch is here to stay.
Can it game?
swwwweeeeeet intro❤🤌
Not buying until the next iteration where that notch actually has FaceID
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m27s">16:27</a> &quot;mac pro has 768 gigs of ram&quot; ???? What ???
The worlds Most Powerful Laptops..  You Can&#39;t imagine This Power ⚡
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m22s">0:22</a> I thought it was 2027 for a second 😂
Is there any confirmation about 2022 MacBook Air?
Finally deciding to upgrade, coming from a mid 2012 MacBook Pro (not retina)
Apple is a money grab for them. I’m pretty sure they could have done all the things you have said.  They are more then capable.  It’s more like we’re gonna give you this, but not give you that.  It’s a marketing tool.   So as soon you buy the laptop.  They give a little more then a little more, just for you to upgrade your laptop. Hello!  they are a multi million dollar company for a reason.
What if we want to use adobe premiere pro and after effects with lot of red giant and video copilot plugins and edit and create gfx in 4k. Especially Red Helium 8k footage. Will it perform
I&#39;d love to ustilise all this computing power on Google docs.
M1 Max and M1 Macs. Yeah terrible naming Apple that&#39;s confusing.
my boi rockin an Artisan Hien for productivity lol. Repectable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m00s">3:00</a>
I think there is a reason why they didn&#39;t include a Ethernet port on the charging brick.  It&#39;s the magsafe.  I don&#39;t think the Magsafe is designed to transfer data, but probably Apple could have done it or it will only work with USB-C connected...but imagine if you were using it, maybe for livestreaming, and someone accidentally tripped on it with the magsafe connected?  You just lost connection.  Just a thought.
Finally 🔥🔥🔥
I was like... 🤯 when I saw the &#39;&#39;travel&#39;&#39; iMac. XD
i have a feeling that apply is gonna bring back the back light on apple logo in the future
It feels like when tech companies introduce a single &quot;actual&quot; innovation, they take away more of what were already there just so every year, they could bring those things back one by one and call them &quot;innovation&quot;.<br><br>Is it because if they kept all of those major innovations, we simply wouldn&#39;t have yearly refreshes of the tech?
That intro 🔥🔥🔥🔥
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> &quot;These laptops have a new TOP NOTCH Design&quot;
That standby time is extremely under appreciated!!!!
What A Intro.
Imagine if Apple made the notch smaller as they could. How would people react if Apple decides to expand the notch in order to fit the face ID module in the next gen.
MAB is bais interms of apple.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=21m36s">21:36</a><br>When Marques holds the MacBook here I feel he loves this great machine , <br>I have MacBook Air M1 and I feel the same way

Everytime I watch your intro, I wonder if I&#39;m still on youtube or watching some big movie. You, my friend are taking youtube to &quot;NEXT LEVEL&quot;.
Apple be getting so good I feel like people are almost bored with how good they are like “yup they killed it again….” 😂 wish I could afford it
finally released. o. m. g. it took too long man
Still loving my 2011 model with the i7 processor. I did have to unload all my apps on a external drive however. Lol
What the hell is he talking about? There are hundreds of laptops that can now edit  and publish high definition videos in hours.
Throw out your windows shit for media related works.
Road to 15 million
Your tech reviews are nice and all, but respectfully get a haircut
Gotta love seeing Marques edit the video I&#39;m watching
Great device. Don’t buy it. 99% of us don’t need that kind of a laptop. Buy the MacBook Air and save $1000 and travel to Europe !
As a software engineer, the GPU and ports aren’t exciting really but I can see why people are stoked who have different workflows.<br>I wish the m1 max had more cpu cores but again, I get why it doesn’t and it’s still faster than my i9 16”. Wish I could get 64GB without shelling for the max but overall, impressed.<br>The all day battery life is cool and the fact that I can put my laptop on a soft surface without it bursting into flames is dope.
He has a 50k Mac Pro? Holy shit.
Gave up on Apple years ago and went to windows. Having said that, I was anticipating this review lol
I wonder how this review will age in 30 years (I imagine like tech reviews from the 90’s talking about state of the art windows 3.1 computers)

Awesome videos sorry I’m soo late
More suger, more sweetness 😀
The notch is so dumb. Clearly they&#39;re prepping for FaceID in a future version, but it shouldn&#39;t be any more than a punchout camera.
I&#39;ve been FVCKING WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO
Perfect! Touched on every point from my checklist on this topic. Thanks
Woaah ! NEXT LEVEL (on compromises for a premium laptop)
I feel like the notch was this size because they intended to put face ID and couldn’t last min
Damn, that intro!
Been reaching the limits of my 2018 since I got the damn thing
Let’s hope socks in sandals won’t happen next year 😂😅
Intro was 😍🙏
Baby groot in the back chillin 😎
Finally!!
Add two more ports, include HDMI 2.1, add FaceID and boom you get the Macbook 2022.
Feels like That &quot;audio waveform preview bug&quot; came with the 10.6 fcpx update, me too does experience it even for a 1080p video editing on m1 mbp
Thanks dude.<br>Gonna have to sell my third kidney to get this 💪
Never been happier with my 13” MacBook Pro purchase from last year. I still have my Touch Bar, I have zero use for an HDMI port or SD card slot, and the base M1 is plenty of performance for me.

Notch is ok on the iPhone but definitely looks atrocious on the MacBook 🤢🤮
Crapple garbage never has the latest tech. You shouldn&#39;t be surprised.
Me hearing him say “768gigs of Ram” : what fking year is it!? 2050?







Daaaang! what a intro! I thought there was some fly of some sort 😂
These MacBooks are all in all a really solid computer for anyone who just wants a great  laptop. It has amazing display, great battery life, great speakers, great build!! For those specially who don’t game much I’d prefer these over any windows notebook at the same price range
Marques on point with the intro music
Probably one of the most Positive reviews ive seen on this channel
So last year&#39;s M1 MacBook would be good for just YouTube and general browsing?
🔥🔥🔥
webcam clipped on top center of the mac has the same effect as the notch
Your video reviews are the same next level as these laptops. <br>Thanks 👍
That is sexy piece of machinery. Also please bring out the review for the beat fit pros
Marques, please check ur insta dms
This is the type of machine that gets me excited for the future!
Plz Remove charger for the Laptop also 😉 dear Apple<br>Still notch notch even in lap wooowww beautiful i love to see in all products apple
Beautiful video !!!! Literally waited for this since the announcement<br><br>(that random ungraded b-roll for the chargers tho oopsies)
been waiting for this one
Now you just need a rollable 21&quot; AMOLED and you&#39;ve got the ultimate mobile editing setup.
Great review! Check is in the mail !!
I will only buy once, the glowing logo is back! Engineering Softwares are not going to come soon to Mac, so stupid purchase for me. Mac Book Air is good.
Did he just say 768gigs of RAM????. Wtf?
Honoreng teh maequqwaaaass beownleewwewee
No lte why 😩
I love this laptop I just hope apple starts making these laptops thinner my only issue with these new MacBook is it’s too chunky
me wishing i didnt get a 2020 M1 Macbook Pro for my birthday in August
Thank you for confirming that: 1. These MacBooks are as beastly as I hoped. And 2. I ordered a MacBook that is insanely overpowered for anything I’ll ever do.


This completes all 2021 macbook pro vid in YouTube 💯🥰<br><br>Been waiting for this upload 💯💯💯
Damn I love these intros
Another outstanding review
gpu weak lol
Nice review bro ❤️
Chill Marques, you’re drooling 🤤 😂
Love the intro! Great video btw!
I want a laptop with amber keyboard backlight.
Oh f*ck yeah I’ve been waiting to buy just for this video. Thank you MKBHD!
From someone coming from a software development perspective, performance is a factor but also compatibility with tools is too. I would like to see a compilation/build benchmark but I bet this was already requested in the past since a lot of software developers use MacBooks
Did he really say his Mac Pro had... 768 gigs RAM?!!!!
Yo! will you be reviewing the Beats Fit Pro？
About time i switched to PC years ago for ease of use and easy ports
did you just say 768 gb ram?
Now imagine when Apple creates Silicon desktop CPU chips with Apple branded graphics cards and RAM sticks.


Marques is getting biased towards Apple, what a shame
Editing wedding videos, 4k, up to 120 fps and color grading with multiple layers of video and audio. M1 Pro or Max?
There have been many cool pieces of Tech this year<br><br>But this is the one review I have been most hyped for in a long long long time
oh boi
That &quot;muhaa&quot; though 😂😂
Marques... What kinda socks and sandals you wearing? Because Apple seems strongly against Face ID in Macs.
Stop making me spend moneyyy
worth the wait
Steve Jobs would have been mighty proud of these cats. NO FANS!!!
WTF is this beard?
I am root... anddd wonderful video, as usual 😉
30 seconds in. Wow. Fantastic visuals, music, transitions. Reaching elite levels of production it’s awesome to see the improvement through the years 👏
what a yummy intro!
I am waiting for engineering Analysis software to work in macbook 😑
There is only one Marques
Silent fans when using Red? Holy
Imagine what the 2022 Mac Pro can do.
Nothing satisfies my soul more than the ratio of mkbhd’s videos
<b>MKBHD&#39;s RAM = My storage!</b> <br>Am I from past or you are from future?
Finally, my own personal experience is complete before the review loool
Apple is going to bring back trash can. Mark my words. And they are definitely going to make fun of those who made fun of trash can. Definitely.
My PC sucks… but this laptop is also mad expensive.
I really wish Apple could give this same charging system to their iPhones..... this could have been could. (better than lame ass magsafe)
There bezel isn’t a part of the specced display, so i have no notch complaints.
Goodbye desktops
This video is great Marques , keep up the great content
I’ve been waiting for this review for the the last two weeks and you didn’t disappoint 🔥🔥👏🏽
Keep up good work!
Yay!
😆😆😆
why don&#39;t you change your channel name to &#39;apple positive reviews&#39;
Finally, LESS DONGLE!!
New &quot;Top Notch&quot; Design... I see what you did there!
Where can I buy that NY Empire Tshirt?
the text at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> is a bit confusing. i assume the bottom line should say max.
Apple needs to stay on their current trajectory. Theyve been doing good things lately. Hopefully some of this feel good can transfer to other products.
I never want to watch these videos because i always just get sad that i’ll never be able to afford one but the production quality is just so good i can’t help myself- who can relate :,(
love u I gotta critique tho- why no usb-B complaints (i feel for most ppl alteast 1 is def a BIG help) do u disagree? / not think its important? why?<br>IF u dont agree PLS pls let me know 😊 (or if u do too!)
I was looking more forward to this video than my graduation
I just can&#39;t wait for a mac mini pro max or whichever desktop they come up with. These machines seem very very impressive for my music &amp; video work






You laugh too 😂😂😂
Weird comments about Apple.
&quot;An new top notch design...&quot; 😂🤣😭
The best Apple salesman, after Steve Jobs.
Are macbooks good for architects
Master of intro track 😎!!!
Took ya long enough
I know a lot of linux guys that want to see these devices running linux. Me included. Linus Torvalds included. The ball is in Apple&#39;s court now.<br><br>But watching reviews, its kinda amazing. This year line up, has gotten a lot of love. <br><br>Am keeping an open mind...
Apple apparently forgot they built a notch on screen. You literally could miss menu bar options because it was hiding behind the notch
You know the review is going to be worth the time and effort by the editing and making of the intro concepts 👌🏻
Awesome review!! I have been waiting for this video from a long time. Could you also give some good benchmarks or comparisons for Machine Learning or Deep Learning workflows which require GPU to train the models.
Every apple product getting a video smells sus to me. 🤔
Finally
The new Mac Pros with, M2 Max or whatever they will name it, will be ridiculous
Ethernet on the brick - they can&#39;t squeeze the brick smaller
im still doing music production on my macbook pro mid 2009, im really left out
A new “top notch design” Marques got bars 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m25s">4:25</a><br>Didn&#39;t expect to get a roast.
For motion graphics work in after effects and video editing in premiere pro, how much RAM is suggested for the 16 inch M1 Max version?
Yo MKBHD, let me get one
Ayo I saw that C2C
768 GB of RAM?!?
I think Apple is training the public, to have face id in the future we need a big notch, this is a trial. this is apple&#39;s way of saying we packed face id in the same space without increasing it from the previous generation.
and here I am with the only Mac I own is a 2011 Mac mini...
Now they need to bring back 17 inch screen back since we are back peddling. I wonder about the heat though...
finally.. thank you..<br>Now I can live in &quot;peace&quot;...
768GB of ram? Did I hear that right?
So I have the 2013 MacBook Pro. Still going strong. I outlived the Touch Bar. I wanted it and now I realized with these launches that I don’t need that. I would much rather have that much power.
Can I have one?
Not a fan of the desing of these Macbooks, they look a bit too retro for my liking.
Did you say $50,000 Mac Pro!?!? 😭
For all the people who use to say apple just uses the pro monicker for there laptops just to make it sound pro but actually isn’t pro, how you doin now bud?!
So if you have any old MacBook s lying around, feel free to send me one 😁
Why does the beginning of this video feel like it’s 1.2x speed.
I love how the shirt says 2019
Finally a good review to help anyone decide if they shuld buy or not
It would be great if Apple Launch a 16&quot; Macbook With regular M1  at Reasonable price
Loved the review been waiting for it for a while! Kept trying to while my iPad screen for about 2 minutes before I realized you have dust on your lens in your talking head main shot. Need that new Apple Polishing cloth!
which external monitor pairs well with M1 Max right now besides pro XDR?
Why did Apple put that stupid notch on the new MacBook Pro. I’m not buying the MacBook Pro with the stupid notch. Apple this is totally unacceptable to have the notch on the MacBook Pro.
Can I have your iMac Pro now?  And the roller too?
I am here deciding, should I buy the 14&quot; MacBook Pro, or wait for the redesigned MacBook Air. The Pro&#39;s performance is just an overkill for my programming workflow.
Actually what is next level is you carrying around an iMac while traveling, that’s insane and next level
Marques is bidding farewell to the imac
So expensive
Really Brilliant Video on macbook Pro review Marques 🔥🔥🔥✨✨✨😌😌👏👏👍👍
For photo editing really large files with 50+ layers in photoshop and for 5000+ image folders in Lightroom, do I gain much benefit from Max?
They made dangles and now we are impressed that they don&#39;t need dongle.
It is what it is😄
He toasted Linus (LTT) in just a millisecond 😂
He finally delivered!! Keep it up
thanks Marques now im going to spend 5 grand
Surface Laptop Studio or 16&quot; Macbook Pro?  am I the only one having problems deciding from those two?
I miss the touch bar and I want it back
Why did it make me SOO happy to see Marques so excited??
These laptops are absolutely blowing my mind right now.
I will just wait until the MacBook Pro ultra next year.
Man it still shocks me how Marques, just ONE GUY alone can make videos on the same quality as a video production studio like LTT



Late to the party but a show stopper , Awesome Marques , now it feels like there is a new tech launched.
Didn’t mention the ghosting :(
there would be a time when everyone using cloud computing and then we will look back and say wtf a single poor machine was such big deal?!
I would love to see you wear shocks and sandals 🤣
I wonder if the intel macpro&#39;s were on purpose made to look shite i the previous model range. <br>Now we have the new shinny toys with all the good stuff, in everyway better.  <br>Hats off to Apple for a smart pre-planned move.
I still think it&#39;s crazy that we are to a point in society that a notch is the biggest problem in our lives, god we have it good.
SICK INTRO!!!
Thank you. Been waiting for your review checking in since your initial reaction video. Thanks for making it comprehensive and worthwhile. Going to bed now.
I’ll never look at anything from the verge.
$50,000 desk top. My goodness! Such an expensive device
I&#39;d love to see the retired travel iMac as a decoration in your office! It&#39;s crazy how fast these new MacBook Pros are!
Cool! Nice video ✌️
The biggest surprise was the iMac in the travel case.
Meanwhile, I recently just replaced my 8 years old laptop hard drive with an SSD...and it is Truly Next Level...🤣🤣
Your pop in sound effects make me think my airpods are going flat.
But how does it handle Microsoft Excel?
Apple needs to keep its MacBook team they are killing it right now.<br>Braided cords. Reinstating ports. The M1 chip. Give them a raise apple they deserve it.
Electrical engineers having their eye twitch at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m54s">4:54</a>
Congratulations, you convinced me a widows user/Linux to use a M1 mac as  laptop
768 gigs of ram
The intro is getting old
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=1m42s">1:42</a> slid that in there like we wouldn&#39;t notice😂
I only trust this guy.
I think the screens are actually 8-bit, not 10-bit displays.
Is this on trending yet? Tell me when it does
nice
Hey my name is Root!!! 😂🤣😅
The Macbook Pro review I&#39;ve been waiting for.
Yes, socks and sandals is better than shaving your eyebrows ;)
My headphones are 470 ohm…. and this laptop finally feels like the proper portable Pro Tools rig for me.
No, instead of the notch I&#39;d rather have the full <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> when going full screen and being able to crop to zoom in a little for videos with higher res than the native display.
I’ve been waiting for this
This time apple focused on video editing, next i think is gaming!!
I just want to purchase it because the MacBook Pro does everything well ALL across the board. How many things about life can you say that about?
Just think about &quot;next&quot; M chips from Apple,  new nanometer process, more speed, and who knows they may make gaphics cards obsolete.
The issue for machine learning is that docker/containers are not supported well
I don&#39;t know why ppl don&#39;t appreciate touch bar. It is very useful to me, especially when using calendar. I&#39;m staying with my 4-ports USB-C Macbook with touch bar for now. Although M1X processor is kinda enticing.
Wonder... Is this good for running solidworks, catia, ansys and abacus, After windows is installed as the 2nd os?
That&#39;s basically how magsafe used to be,  you just can&#39;t pull it straight out
Marques bricked up during this whole review
At the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> mark I think you made a typo. The bottom one should say M1 Max MBP?
Getting one this Christmas. The ports are back and the touchbar gone. All boxes checked.
Does it can charge with USB C ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m06s">12:06</a> I mean, this is fine for people who dont have work to do, but i split screen content ALL the time, and half the apps i use have the menu bar running all the way over to the notification area. Honestly, i&#39;ll be waiting for a M1 Max Mac Mini and just multiple workstations with a dock if i need to move back and forth, and a cheap windows laptops if i need to be mobile. Yes i like that the ports came back, i like the FN keys being back, i like the screen overall, but bad UX has to be dealt with every day.<br>But hey, the missing part of the UX, and missing touchbar is just par for the course, Apple has to remove at least some functionality every interation or the&#39;re not &#39;courageous&#39;
I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals like Linus.<br>That&#39;s brutal.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a>
OMG LOOK AT THE GROOT IN THE BACKGROUND 🥺🥺😍
What&#39;s the reason you are keeping the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m54s">0:54</a> android toy behind you, it&#39;s just annoying while seeing a review of MAC book
It&#39;s a really good laptop the fact that it doesn&#39;t have a touch screen is the very reason I won&#39;t buy one
From someone coming from a software development perspective, performance is a factor but also compatibility with tools is too. I would like to see a compilation/build benchmark but I bet this was already requested in the past since a lot of software developers use MacBooks

“A new top-notch design.” I see what you did there.
Lol at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m24s">12:24</a> on the Linus burn with socks and sandals!
Did he say 768 gigs of ram <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a>
As a Windows and Pixel user, this does look interesting. Might finally switch to the other team....

Let&#39;s back up a bit. HOW much did that freaking desktop cost? How is that price (beyond being a tax write off) justifiable?
Top Notch Design! Just couldn’t resist I see!😂😎
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m04s">17:04</a> Messed with the name = M1 Pro -&gt;  M1 Max :(
Put the Pro and Max chips in a Mac Mini and I&#39;ll sell what&#39;s left of my soul to get one.
The intro is pretty awesome.
Apple&#39;s been removing features from their devices and bring them back later as a revolutionary advancements...<br>Like: New Mac...Now with PORTS <del>and a bezel</del>

I’m a dev. The primary project I work on at the moment took 6 minutes to build on my 2016 15” MBP. Now with the 16” M1 Pro MBP with 32GB of RAM it takes &lt; 2 minutes. Bonkers. That right there makes it worth the price tag. Not to mention the other design updates. I’ve also been really enjoying the thermal efficiency— it’s the first time in a long time where I’ve been comfortable sitting on a couch working for a long time with the machine on my lap because it just doesn’t get hot!
























Try Speaking This:<br><br>M1 Max<br><br>Now try Speaking This:<br><br>M1 Macs<br><br>You get what I mean right?
What an intro
I have never clicked so fast on a video in my life. You are the chosen one.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m05s">17:05</a> bottom should read M1 Max MBP instead of M1 Pro?
someday, in a better day ~

A balanced review I&#39;ve not seen for a while.
My new space grey Mackbook has silver MagSafe charger wtf

I think my ocd will have a problem with the notch.
Your videos are meditative and somewhat therapeutic
Yoo
Todays into was on a different level… I rewatched it 10 times
Dude... That inrto!! That&#39;s most cool opening I&#39;ve ever seen on a Macbook review!! 😍🔥
Okay, either I&#39;m high or these apple products look old as hell like circa 2009.
来了来了
Reports: Netflix CEO gets BUSTED with 13,000 files of CHILD PORNOGRAPHY..
Yeah that is a huge computer to lug around, referring to that iMac!
Apple will probably let Marques wear socks and sandal for a full day.
THE ICONS DBRAND SKIN ON THE MAC WAIT AM I DUMB OR HAVE THOSE NOT BEEN RELEASED YET???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=10m15s">10:15</a> &quot;top notch design&quot; is actually genius 💀
This machine, how much bad it&#39;ll feel when it&#39;ll get even scratches also. Not worthy  :-(
I&#39;m still smiling from the comment &quot;Linus wearing socks with sandals.
“It is what it is”<br>~ mkbhd
I wonder if all of his supercomputer  just to making these vanilla videos.
Mac is next level, money is also next level kkkkk
The MacBook Pro inscription was so cool. Why they removed it ? Terrible design decisions.
Watched a lot of these M1 Pro/Max videos and most are video content creators who these machine benefit the most.   I noticed in the videos I&#39;ve scene none have shown or commented on the video on a monitor connected to the HDMI port.   So the performance as good as viewing the laptop&#39;s own screen.      <br><br>You and others videos mention that the HDMI and SDcard drive aren&#39;t up to the top spec and not sure why.    I look at Apple and it seems like they have held back so they have something for the next update.    Also the high impedance headphone port,   Most headphones today still use their impedance from when people had home stereo with nice receivers that sent more power to the headphone port.   These days many people are plugging headphones into lower power devices like laptops, iPad,  digital keyboards and similar devices, these devices have low output to the headphone port.     Me I use my headphones mainly on my iPad and plugging into my workstation keyboard for late night practice both are low powered headphone ports.   I just bought some new BeyerDynamic  DT 770&#39;s but got the 32Ohm version, they sound great and being 32Ohm they are plenty loud plugged into my iPad and keyboard. <br><br>I do like you&#39;re suggestion that Apple put a ethernet port on the power brick for the MBP&#39;s.   I also got for a wired Ethernet connection first so having that without a dongle would be great.  Another thing for Apples next MBP update.
i&#39;m planning to upgrade my mid 2012 macbook pro 13&quot; towards a m1 pro/max in 14&quot;, the only limitations i have is between cpu to ram specs (m1 pro upto 32gb ram vs m1 max at 64) due to future-proofing to use a mac for next 6-10 years of use mainly for programming and some media content like video editing and streaming
So you took ages before publishing a review, where you just cited other reviewers. Pathetic laziness!
my man casually says &quot;my mac pro has 768 gigs of ram&quot; like he&#39;s talking about an ssd 😦
















That effect MKBHD did when the video started should be on the next gen laptops,
I&#39;ve accepted the notch, but a thicker top bezel to hide the notch? Somewhat counterproductive.
Waiting for Dbrand to send me my Icon skin for my 14inch.
The design is atrocious. 2/10.
Spectacular! @MKBHD No other review comes even close to this one. Keep<br>going champ!
It’s a request to all the YouTubers could you please stop defending the ugly notch … I know you have been paid to do so but still…..
When you realise 64 gigs of ram ain&#39;t enough
Hopefully Apple&#39;s return to sanity makes its way over the the Air next update...
How was your Twitter these past few days? hahahaha
High impedance is 150, 300 and 600 Ohm. My guess is 150 is the real max for them. 300 would definitely struggle on them
I love 20syl and love that you use their music ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thought there was a supply shortage of MKBHD videos for how long I&#39;ve waited for this one. Awesome review!
bro really playing the edm version of right above it lmao
🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣lol<br>lol <br>lol    ,,,,,,
Killer intro! 🔥🔥🔥
I just realized that MKBHD looks up above the camera after  few seconds for some reason. Really enjoyed the video anyway coz the content is what matters more.
If they put the same sized notch on the upcoming macbook pro, im gonna wesr socks and sandals for a day.<br><br>DID U GUYS HEAR THIS? LET&#39;S NOT FORGET THIS OKAY? cuz im sure that notch design will be used by apple for a looooooong time.
&#39;ve been waiting for this for years haha
keep the great vids up, Marques.
Base 14” MacBook M1 Pro is my first ever MacBook and I love it!!! The everything is a massive improvement coming from a Samsung windows. Hoping this would last me at least 7 years.
Finally
If you don&#39;t edit vidoes MacBooks are useless then.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m25s">12:25</a> I&#39;m gonna save this for next year😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m58s">20:58</a><br>What really he wanted to say....<br>&quot;Just because..... I got money u poor souls&quot; 😜😂😂✌
Will this be a good option for an architecture student? I use multiple programs at the same time and also rendering
You traveling with your iMac was the first thing I thought when I saw how this handled 8K. <br><br>And the silent fans on Red raw might be the most impressive demo I’ve seen of what these can do, way more surprising than the ProRes performance

















My new favourite hobby is watching Apple haters try and weave and squirm as they try and make shit up why this isnt a fantastic laptop.
Most awaited ✨👀😭🥺
🔥 🔥 🔥
hope you found that cordless vacuum
Hey Marques, mind telling us where you got the NYC subway PCB in the background from? Looks wicked cool. 😁
Happy Diwali MKBHD
man this apple silicon is SO GOOD, I&#39;m far from a mac person but i would be stupid to neglect the power of the M1 silicon family, DAMN BOI, HE POWERFUL
I like this guys voice
Apple: Money is transferred, please.
Screen cut out to accommodate some shit? Really?
What about the sound??? 🤦
Socks and sandals. Deal.
Have been waiting for this since forever. Grabbing popcorns now!
Retiring a travel imac proves that these are a beast
Does anyone use full size SD cards anymore though?
Alder lake is faster... You do know that right?
I really want to ditch my gaming laptop for this MacBook. The steam deck will have to fill my PC gaming needs.
F*** it, in Brazil this new mac book starts at $4,800 not the $1,999
Certainly they found a reason for not having c in upcoming phones
God I love these videos. You’re killing it man!
is that baby groot in the background? lol
The little groot in the background is the best thing 😍
Good review, but can we actually game on a Macbook now?
Great review as always! These are no doubt, revolutionary. <br>How about the longevity though? As everything is &#39;integrated&#39; in a chip, if there is even a tiny issue with RAM, or a single connection on the board, you have to replace almost the whole MacBook with almost the same price as new after a year. MacBooks famously are not repairable, just replaceable. So what we are paying is for is essentially just 1 year of assured use. <br>(Saying this as my 2017 Mac died for no reason after just a year, also my iPhone 7 after a year and half.) Or factor in Apple care cost while buying a new apple product. So basically, the cost of new Apple product is more than you think. *I am still a long-time Apple guy though 😛




I don&#39;t see marques kissing... Saying jesus.... Basically being tech horny that often....... So it gotta be the best 😌😂✌
im sorry did he say 768 Gb ram on his mac pro?!
Mind - you don&#39;t need to watch the review you are never going to buy it.<br>Finger - stfu i know what i am doing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> I think it should be labeled M1 Max not Pro
but the question is can you play fortnite? i guess not
i am photographer, i never heard of UHS III Sd Cards... the only faster cards than UHS II were XQD or CF
No you’re just an Apple fan boy! Apple is paying you to promote this! 🤡
Seeing all these review videos are driving me nuts while I wait for mine to come in… 😩😩😩
Marques is the only one who can keep me watching without skipping any part of the vid
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=5m12s">5:12</a> Not to be that guy but wouldn&#39;t high impedance headphones require an amp not necessarily a DAC
Just don&#39;t put them next to the XPS lol. Even the 16&quot; can&#39;t hang with the 14&quot; XPS speakers
how is the performance between m1 pro 14 inch vs the m1 air :|
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m15s">20:15</a> 😂
Top notch design. 😁

I mean, 7k bucks for a laptop is kinda insane-
MKBHD and Dave2d: They are just tools...
LETSS GOOOO !!! SuperrrrrrHypeddddd Marques you are the MAN
I love the Touch Bar, I use mine every day, I really hate that it didn’t take off and it gets soo much hate.
I don&#39;t see why you have to carry a imac for editing..i mean we just watch your videos for info not video quality...it doesn&#39;t matter if its 720p rather than 4k.
Thanks for taking to time to evaluate these products with regards to real-life workflows in order to provide a &quot;qualified&quot; and quality review. Others would do well to follow your lead. Two thumbs up and keep up the excellent work.
768GB of RAM !🤔
M1 Pro Max Ultra for the next Mac Pros! 😄
I’m just in love with the intros from this channel.
Others: I wish I could buy a Lamborghini, buy a million dollar villa, be a philanthropist <br>Me: I wish I could make an intro like that
Finally
Here before 1 mill squad <br>👇🏼
I thought it was kinda funny that he had the android bot sitting right there while reviewing one of the biggest Apple products of all time. Anyway, it was an incredibly quality video, I wish there was a scene showing him putting the macbook into a backpack right after the scene with the huge carrying case.
he tried to say top notch design with a straight face, and he starts laughing at his own joke lol<br>🤣
Never heard a sentence before which includes both Only&quot; and &quot;64 Gigs of Ram&quot;.
I’ve need desiring to do content creation for YEARS but I haven’t had the capabilities with my equipment! I wish I could invest in this so I can start and go full throttle! This would set me up for years to come!

At last a contender for my macbook 2015
That groot is cool 👌👌
cheers to being the first review to call it an ENGRAVING. I feel like im losing my mind at everyone calling it embossing.


I want one now and don&#39;t even need it lol
is there a typo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m10s">17:10</a>?
In a Pinch, the Macbook Pro is truly next level.
as a full stack developer i will have to update from macbook pro 2016 to this new m1 max
Jesus Christ these MacBooks are…. I have no words… Apple literally said fk you bitches mac book go brrrrrrrrr.
Apple :- we making top-notch product,<br>That&#39;s why we have a notch on top 😂😂😂
Best review on the net
Hate Magsafe, another cable to carry around that doesn&#39;t work on my headphones or phone
Finally!
Damn that&#39;s it. I&#39;m getting the M1 max. Especially after a 1600 trade-in value that apple is offering on my laptop
Top notch design 😌
Please make a whole video like you do your intros
Anyone wanna buy a 13” M1 with touch bar 😂😂😂
Time to retire my Early 2015 MBP I suppose, especially since they finally brought back the ports lol
Amazing review!! 🔥🔥
So who is going to make a micro sd card to half depth sd card adapter first?
I have a couple vlogger friends carry a iPad pro/Mac mini combo for travel... but never an iMac. I imagine a mac mini with the pro M1 chips would be great for them.
That introo 🚀🚀
its gonna be hard to give up that 27&quot; screen
Yes, until next yr.
the notch is necessary because mini LED is too thick so it was either have a larger top bezel or notch.
I’ve said this time and time again. Apple could make their notch smaller, but they don’t for good reason. Because they take the time to actual follow design principals and make it feel intentional. <br>I actually like the notch look of the iPhones. I much prefer it to a hole punch. It feels premium and designed in my opinion. It feels like actual effort went into integrating it purposefully and they spent time to engineer it as such. Whereas hole punch cutouts or larger bezels just feel like an afterthought and laziness. <br><br>Similarly, too small of a notch or just some small hole punch cutouts on the MBP would make it look like an afterthought.



No it doesn’t beat rtx 3080 in premier. It kind of beats 3060 there
Hey Happy Diwali Marques And Love From India 🎉🇮🇳
Do you think Apple employees ever sit around like &quot;Ok Marques has dropped his review... gather round everyone&quot;

That was amazing and carrying imac was mind blowing🤯🤯and great video Dude. I did notice you use the Pixel 6!!
It is what it is
I&#39;ll never understand folks who don&#39;t set their bottom icon bar to just pop up when you move your cursor to the bottom of the screen. Such a much cleaner look.
Got an ad for an HP Laptop 😂😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m26s">4:26</a> Any DankPods fans in the comments??
Uff is finally here! The review I have been waiting for since it launched.
Halfway through the video and im done. I looked at the prices of 14 inch. Not in this life time for me, so. .I&#39;m gonna go listen to music. That price point hurt my soul a bit.
Intro was insane
&quot;My first thought was ...........*Minecraft villager sound*&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m30s">0:30</a>
The keyboard looks really awesome.
Intel: Finally its time to leave Earth 🌎
Why not M1 Max Mac Mini, and a hotel room with a great TV
I bought the fully specced out 14-inch (M1 Max (maximum specs), 64GB RAM, 2TB SSD), because I plan on using it for a variety of visually intensive creative tasks (video editing, art, animation, etc) and need it to last (in a production-usable state) for a minimum of four-five years. So that hefty price tag (over $4k) is something I see as an investment, rather than a hole in my wallet.<br><br>It&#39;s more like a gently smoldering crater...
Working on my 14 inch max, I am pretty confident I can continue to work remotely all day with my small power bank attached and have full desktop level performance sitting in a cafe. In fact i did not even carry my Macbook charger today, lol!
I usse chrome with many....many tabs and that notch would drive me crazy. I do research and will frequently have notes and books spread out all over my desk and multiple displays with multiple windows open on those displays, and frequently mutiple tabs open with my frequently switching between those tabs and opening new tabs over the course of an entire day...sometimes 10-12 hours at a stretch, and something like that which would just ruin my flow would drive me crazy
So, it&#39;s more expensive but mostly good &quot;in a pinch.&quot; And nobody seems to care there is no USB A port? Really? I would have gladly given up a USB C port for one of those.
I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day<br>Like linus. 😂
Like I gotta ask, SD card slot, Headphone Jack, More ports are great when they make a comeback on the macbook but are pointless on a Xperia 1 iii? how :S
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a> the third line should be M1 Max MBP
Finally its here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=9m50s">9:50</a> MKBHD casually flexing that Obama follows him on Twitter.
Finally,the most trusted reviewer...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=14m55s">14:55</a> MKBHD just can’t help but fan boy. I can only imagine how much he restrained himself on this
These intros are really dope
The real song name is Calling Crows by Alltta and 20syl -_-
Did he said in &quot;M1 Max has 64 gb of RAM, the M1 Pro, there is 768gb of RAM&quot;? video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m20s">16:20</a>
I really don&#39;t like Apple but man, this is some impressive stuff. Hope it can move the industry forward a bit D:
Socks and sandals, now I actually want Apple to not include the Face ID
Baby GROOOOOOT
FINALLY!!!!! Great video as always Marques, and keep up the amazing intros too! I was thinking about getting this laptop, and you&#39;ve just convinced me.
Please for the love of what is sane don&#39;t wear socks and sandals together, please I beg you, I unsubscribed to LTT for reasons you won&#39;t believe.
Its crazy how much thicker it got than last gen.
165k views in one hour.. 🤩 damn! Winning at Youtube 💪🏽
Good luck beating alder Lake
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> should be M1 Max instead of M1 Pro for the last row
The hapiness and excitement tht I got when  I saw u released the long waited mac video is unexplainable!!!<br>Love from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 ❤



Cool effect on the intro- is there a plugin for that in FCP?
Okay but can it run an assembly in solidworks?
Anyone know how good the battery life is on the M1 Max 16&quot; for heavy workloads outside video editing? I bought it and am currently waiting on it being shipped however I am starting to get worried after seeing a video of the M1 Max 16&quot; only lasting 3 hours after doing blender work for an hour + light use cases for the rest of the time.
Do anyone notice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m05s">17:05</a>
&quot;I mean if you hate it that much-&quot;<br>I LOATHE it
768 Gigs of RAM 🤯
screw it. im waiting for the next macbook air instead
Yo this whole trend of focus on the negatives or what they shorted out on or their opportunities , RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO, needs to ducking stop. LTT does it too, I know why you guys do it because it brings “value” to the video and to the manufacturers, and actually helps improve products. Bud please move that shit to the end of the video. It’s fucking weird , reviewing a badass laptop and you start off with the negatives. Terrible vibe. Add it to the end, stop doing this


Notch is outdated design. Can&#39;t believe people are living with it even today
dude i cannot get over how ugly the redesign is
So they brought back ports but still no regular USB A port for mice etc would the regular student really need 2 thunderbolt ports?
&quot;Like Linus&quot; 😂
I would wait a few more years for the M series platform to mature and hopefully the Wuhan Flu and the Supply Chain issue are resolved resulting in cheaper prices.
Boycott all Chinese products 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Absolutely astonishing laptops!
Is it viable as a programer?
I&#39;m the only person in the world that will defend the touch bar.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m08s">17:08</a>. should be M1 Max MBP instead of M1 Pro MBP
Boycott all Chinese products 🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
you finally here Marques!!!
Do I need to upgrade from Air m1?
The shell looks like a 13 year old macbook
Merry Christmas
Such a biased mKbhD version I&#39;m seeing here 😭😭
Seems kind of stupid to compare the 2021 M1 CPU to a 2018 intel cpu
So satisfying with the performance!
Lol. Apple can never fully satisfy these tech guys.  Why dont they make their own product
Popcorn ready. Hype over 9000. See you on the other side
I could actually seeing you screaming with joy when reviewing these computers 😂😂😅

It’s not official until MKBHD makes a review
Every computer is a laptop if your case is big enough.
Here within an hour!
Time to trade in my 2019 Mac for this.
Error at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a>. It listed &quot;M1 Pro MBP&quot; again, instead of &quot;M1 Max MBP: 4 :06&quot;
Uh…150k views in one hour….😶
When he said “Jesus” 😂
“ENTHUSIAST LAPTOP”
How much ram you got on that iMac?
I wasn&#39;t impressed... Some visually intensive tests that I myself wasn&#39;t worth the 2.5k total.
Apple better be taking notes from all these reviews!
Bout time
never been this eary
I figured they have to remove faceid at the last minute and the screens were already on order with a long lead time.

First &quot; for real REAL&quot; review ! About time mkbhd .
Remember the S10 launch when he actually brought the iMac in a car.....well....not anymore
What took you so long marques?  Marques there is no way i can buy that if only i can win one of that! Im a graphic designer badly need that one, but wayy too impossible for me.
finally! So excited to watch this video
Now it come to do I really need it 🤔
Boycott all Chinese products 🙏 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I bought the m1 2020 version this July 🗿
The notch is pointless if it doesn’t have Face ID.
Truly a &quot;Top Notch&quot; Design lol
Humble opinion.. I suspect these were meant for machine learning and VR/AR animators, so that&#39;s why it is shredding through these high res vid rendering tasks.
Having fast charge is great, and I&#39;m happy that those mag-safe cables are completely modular since Apple cables are notorious for disintegrating. Buy extras, people!


Boycott all Chinese products 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Who knows , we might get M2 next year (of course with a face id and reduced notch)…;)
Holyshitttt the intro was absolute fireee
maybe apple think to provide the big notch at first and then put the face id in next iteration so they can call it improvement, instead of make it small at first and then the notch get bigger after they add additional functionality on it
Late! But Latest though.
I’ve been watching so many videos on this thing and it’s fucking insane how good it is. I bought a new MacBook a couple years ago and I want to upgrade to this even though I don’t really need it😂
Khopadi
I came to a thought of you just make it ridiculous to take iMac with you, what on earth can’t any laptop company build super laptop for this man !
The top notch design 😂
as someone who hates apple more than anything in this world im happy for once they did something that is going to perpetuate the industry forward, for once apple isnt showing the industry &quot;ppl will buy our products no matter what&quot; and instead its &quot;apple silicon is revelutionary&quot;
I am watching this right now on my 14&quot; M1 Pro base model. This laptop does everything that I need it to do. Photo editing here and there and occasionally playing Diablo 3.
It only cost 6k where imac pro cost 50k
You really kept us waiting
Awesome video dude I you made me wish I worked in video but I don’t so the M1 MacBook Air is more than enough for me
Tech reviewers: Hurry! Gotta be the first to review M1 max<br>Everyone else: Waiting for MKBHD review
Apple need to hire mkb and his team for their intros

Cool!
lol groot in the corner
Here within an hour of release
socks and sandals like linus lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Nice

Finally….. 🍿 🙌🏿👍🏿🔥
I&#39;m not in favor of the port stuff.<br><br>I would instead want more usb-c. I don&#39;t need a single one of those non-usb-c ports, and all of those can be done with USB-c
Ooof, what a shining review. Very cool to watch
Boycott all Chinese products 🙏
Have been waiting for MKBHD review for such a long🥲... Finally
Like Linus 😂😂
You’re dedication to solely using that Travel iMac is quite amazing. I’m very surprised you never looked into making a travel sized PC that could also run MacOS.
Boycott all Chinese products 🙏
Why would you want an hdmi? USB C has faster audio, video, and data transport, AND it’s reversable… PLEASE stop being shitty consumers who want 30 year old ports like a boomer. Please stop ruining and antiquating technology… I get it, as organisms we desire familiarity but the old MacBook is newer technology…

Why I am watching this i couldn&#39;t afford one Apple Polishing Cloth<br><br>😁
Love the video Marques. Just wondering about your comment regarding the size of the notch. Are there any laptops that have webcams in a tiny bezel that actually have decent webcam quality? Dave2D compared the webcam quality of the macbook and an XPS 15 I believe and there was a massive difference in  quality. I think Apple made a good move incorporating a notch to compromise between small bezels and good webcam quality imo.
Man!<br>Your Intro Are getting dopper and dopper in every single video!!
This seemed like a rich People review. Never considering how expensive the MacBook you need to get in order to have decent config
Was very eager man!!
These people really put a notch on a laptop
You are so…   Fantastic!!!
Sir can it game 🎮
Finally！！！！
Is the audio off?
Apple is finally becoming better without intel...
That thing is gonna be awesome for 3D rendering (Blender, Maya), my ryzen 7 4800H is already obsolete
Marques : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m24s">16:24</a> &quot;M1 Max only has 64 GB RAM and Mac I have edited on has 768 GB RAM&quot;<br><br><b>*Me crying with 8 GB RAM on my pc*</b>
Definitely a great review.
Hey Marques !<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m06s">17:06</a> <br>The third timing you mentioned, shouldn’t it be ‘M1 Max MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>’ ?<br>Not trying to point out .<br>One of your oldest fan :)




@Marques Brownlee  at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> it should be M1 max
Marques, you really are the most influential tech reviewer on planet. Just love it reviews.
It’s good to know Marcus that you are a believer in Jesus Christ…….@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=18m06s">18:06</a> ❤️❤️❤️❤️😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇😇
Ultimate review❤️
I would love to watch you wear socks with sandals 😂
The ports are not convenience in a pinch, its a cost cutting measure because a lot of people won’t even know it was a lower tech
for someone don’t use the cam, even put tape over it, definitely don’t need the notch
First they blame and then they copy. <br><br>(notch)
hi
Your product shots are sure better than apple&#39;s. It showed them accurately.
Marques: So I&#39;ve been using the M1 Max MacBook Pro for about 2 weeks now...<br>US: Yeah uh we kw 😋
OMG  fucking beautiful video
‘I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day, like Linus’ had me laughing

Wow
That tool part is copied
finally the only review that matter
Apple Marketing: Take away your needs. Give you back and so you can THANK ME... wtf
mkbhd has a honey ad that played before this mkbhd video what the heck
&quot;your move, Microsoft (PC)&quot;
I only clicked because of dt 770 pro
MagBuk
That intro was worth the wait.
Now apple makes a really nice and usable laptop.... but its old and ugly looking. We can never have it all
Awesome video bro keep up the good work ❤️
been waiting in this one
It would be interesting to see a Mac Mini with M1 Pro/Max
Might have to take out a loan for this one
MKBHD knocks it out of the park.  He delivered a very impressive review of a game changing tool.   He also set a new benchmark for tech reviewers.  <br><br>Something else too.  Take a look at the location where the review was shot.  Look at the white walls.  One can see different shades of whites.  Ditto the desk surface.  The same may be said of all the colors.  Simply stunning.<br><br>If anyone who says shooting in 8K (with a Red Camera)  is not worth it, I would seriously ask that they take a look at this video.  He or she will notice a qualitative difference between how MKBHD&#39;s  content looks, when compared to everyone else&#39;s.  Even go so far as to compare his video to Apple&#39;s latest event.  The difference is noticeable. <br><br>In the end, one sees why MKBHD sets the industry standard for Youtube / Tech reviewers.  He is next level.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a> boldest statement.
Please @MKBHD does the screen looks better than the $6000 Pro Display XDR one?
Ethernet on the power brick doesn’t make sense for a portable device that you would have to continuously connect on and take off.<br><br>Additional comment: intro was fire.
Travelling with an iMac would be so annoying
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m01s">17:01</a> M1 Max*
How many times have people said you had M1 Pro written instead of M1 Max at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m05s">17:05</a>?
Wish it was a full depth SD so I could use it for storing some files on (that don&#39;t require high speeds)<br><br>I feel it&#39;s a deliberate move to stop people doing that and upsell on storage at purchase

Damn, my Dell XPS has some incredible competition! Looking forward to seeing what dell comes out with to compete with these!



It is 6 digits in price with 5 zeros in India so , simply I can&#39;t afford it
So when is Marques and team winning an award you said?
I have been waiting for this 🤩🤩
I believe they just had 5 years to bet on USB-C TB taking over. 5 years is up.
OMG TOP NOTCH DESIGN BatChest
I believe impedance is higher as the number gets lower .  4 ohm impedance is higher than 8 ohm, for example .
Ay
Much awaited Macbook review is finally here!<a href="about:invalid#zCSafez"></a>

Bro... hope you found a good deal on the cordless vacuum.







LOL at “top notch design”. :)
I think this days more about the $50k Mac Pro... I know everyone knows it&#39;s a waste of money but now even apple fan boys have to agree.
Did he say 768gb of RAM??? For the Mac Pro?
finally, the bottom bezel doesn&#39;t feel the need to say macbook pro anymore. much like iphones removing the annoying slab of legal text!
Goes to show how dumping money into apple products is not sustainable. He bought a $50k tower that is already losing its value.
me in my online class browsing youtube and i find this saying&quot;42 minutes ago&quot; and jusst clicks it bcuz it&#39;s 42 mins ago.
&quot;Ahh yes, I just pack up my travel iMac...&quot;
Sorry no apple product is next level when most things i would do with i can&#39;t do without jailbreaking or installing virtual windows. Apple is trash.
Can it run Genshin Impact? If not, I’ll skip
I love how the you used the new final cut tracking feature in your intro. Nice call out all around.
Cheers to panda pixel skin!
“The review of this new MacBook Pro video is 22 minutes long but I’ve had this MacBook and tested it for over 22 years” MKBHD
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> looks like a typo. should say M1 Max MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>, right?
Finally..
Well, think about it… how would Ethernet on the power adapter work with MagSafe? That’s the primary use for the charging brick here…
The thing is laptops when new works like magic.. but after taking some wear and tear on ram and cpu it would start triggering the problems
Okay, these M1 Max laptops are just mind blowing... Perfect creator&#39;s laptop


Should&#39;ve gone for the dedicated numpad

I see that GMMK Pro chillin, great keep.
I&#39;ve never liked Apple. But holy fucking shit that&#39;s insane. Can&#39;t even comprehend what a Mac Pro with Apple silicon could do.
It&#39;s straight up futuristic. Bought it seconds after release.
The way Marques says, &quot;...but!&quot;

Excellent review! Gratz on not lugging the iMac around anymore!
Boycott all Chinese products 🙏
Waiting so hard for this review of a notebook I can’t even afford 🤣



Ur the best! Ps. Congrats on winning the Aiaawardsss!!!
Apple should give consumers a way to at least  SSD upgrade  later
Nothing for anyone other than Video editors :p
It is so sad that Indian has to pay 20-40% extra because of tax...M1 macbook pro 16 cost around 2.4 Lac rupees and in usa it is 2500 USD...just for reference 25000 USD = 1.86 lac rupees
Amazing laptop. The ONE thing that makes it tough is non-replaceable batteries. It’s like building a formula one car with ehe engine welded into the frame, the engine wears out of course, and the whole car has to be thrown out. Or am I missing something?




One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
I want to see MKB play league of legends on a macbook.
I use the touchbar every day. I wish they put it above the function keys, but I&#39;m glad they put real buttons back.
Hey Marques, when can we start seeing HDR on these videos?
Watching this from my 16&quot; M1 Macbook pro
At these prices/specs they are tools not toys..
Great vid, but the audio isn&#39;t the best. I can eat faint mouth noises at the end of most of your sentences
Hit my screen cuz thought there was a bug there.... great intro!
Not sure if not using a tripod for “B roll” is a new thing to try but the video is really bouncing around..
I volunteer as tribute to accept the 2021 MacBook Pro Giveaway that you did not mention. Thanks! :D
Thank you for this great video im not sure what to get gaming laptop or the new apple laptop using this for photoshop and crafting business
&quot;Cordless vacuum deals&quot;? 😂
YES! A REVIEW FROM MARQUES!
Welcome Backbook Pro
finally, look at the timeline, satisfied
Good to know USB C almost 100W
“Top notch design” LOL
I am Groot
The hype is real… Must buy one.
The only review I have dying for!!!
Like Linus 😹😹
You can&#39;t defend the notch...
Everytime a new product comes out, its next level, its innovative, its so powerful.

Nice Bro
&quot;top notch design&quot; see what you did there
Loving the subtle Google pixel usage while reviewing a macbook.
I love that groot plant 😍
&quot;top notch&quot; design!

Who noticed the GROOT tree in the background....🌳
that late audio waveform preview is FCP 10.6 issue, have on intel iMac also
I’ll only buy a MacBook if they go touchscreen and add Apple Pencil support. Otherwise I’ll just stick with my iPad Pro and Windows Laptop.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=15m10s">15:10</a> <br>&quot;Untitled project&quot;<br>Save early, save often!
When you compare it with Intel based laptops, do you also consider PRICE TO PERFORMANCE RATIO?<br><br>Because not everyone is as rich as you are and may yet need a computer?


Did he just say that MB Pro has &quot;only&quot; 64GB of RAM and his Mac Pro has 768GB of RAM?
One less dongle, solving a problem they created themselves
700 GB of ram are you ridiculous 🤯🤯😱
Damn boy he thicc <br>That&#39;s a thick ass boy <br>Damn
Literally intro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dislikes came from laggy android users
Well, all mkbhd intros are dope🔥🔥🔥
I&#39;ve used it. Its fast. But my 2020 M1 MacBook Pro is fast too so I&#39;ll stick with it for a bit longer.
All verified first comments😂
Nice intro! <br><br>Finally a macbook PRO
God, i wish it was cheaper
I wish they kept the Touch Bar. I actually liked it a lot.
I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals like Linus 😂😂😂
is there a way to get iOS apps into Mac
Yea I couldn&#39;t agree more. Been using the maxed out Macbook 16 inch M1 Max for a week now, editing my content in Resolve 17 and wow...lets just say i&quot;m finally getting rid of my 10 Core iMac pro. This thing is an editing beast


















































This actually took a serious time to review. Finally u r here
Heh, typo on the results at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a>. &quot;M1 Max&quot; for the final result, not &quot;M1 Pro&quot;. Need to spend a couple minutes re-exporting. ;)
When he says the screen is top notch is kinda funny with a notch
But how many but said in the video?😂
So many &quot; BUT&quot;😄
Another advertisement from imkbhd
Tempted to upgrade from my 2016 MacBook Pro (the first one with the touchbar). But hardly use the pro for anything but internet these days so tough sell on paying an extra $1k for the pro.
MKBHD reviewing a product be like: its cool ---- MKBHD reviewing an Apple product be like: ITS NEXT LEVEL

Watching this on my 2020 Macbook Pro. I feel like a poor ass.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=19m20s">19:20</a>, making Android apps… in Mac, lol
Best MacPro video on the Tube
with &quot;pro motion&quot;, does that mean if we watch a 24fps movie we&#39;ll get perfect 1:1 between screen and file data? Rather than the frame blends when things don&#39;t line up properly. if it went to 24/48fps automatically that would be great. I&#39;m guessing the applications themselves have to start supporting it...


Writing C++ on Clion, while running discord, terminal, notion (note-taking, organizer app like Evernote) kills my MacBook M1 pro 14&quot; within 3-4 hours for me... IDK why I expected more. Maybe Clion needs to optimize.
Lmao I wear socks and sandals for a day. 😂😂.  So many at the airports!!! 😂😂😂
Top notch design 😂
Everybody else: Uploads in  360p <br><br><br><br>Your boi Marques: Would anybody like some 4K?
top notch design 😂 😂 lol
I really like 14&#39; MacBook Pro. I need to do some films editing. Should I upgrade the memory from 16GB to 32GB?🙄
Didn&#39;t watch any other reviews, I was waiting for this video to come out
Can it run crysis?
The way you hold those MacBook&#39;s makes me anxious
As a 2020 M1 owner, there is just a pain to hearing how great these are. I spent a lot of saved up cash on an M1, and it has done me great. Sometimes I wish things were a little more spaced out. But props to those leveling up



How did you get a white and black Pixel 6? dbrand skin??
the amount of ram on your desktop is wild
did MKBHD just say JESUS
I was literally just looking for these reviews and was wondering if you&#39;d post tonight hahaha
Never seen this man speechless Apple really out did themselves
The review many have been waiting for.
Finally.
Just gonna pull up Shazam for that intro song real quick…
What&#39;s written on the back wall? 🤔
I am Groot!
He was carrying a 50k computer around all the time, what a thug
I&#39;ve been waiting for this one!
Truly top notch?
Still in disbelieve that my late 2013 Macbook Pro still has more ports than the 2021 model has :&#39;D<br>2x Thunderbolt, 1x MagSafe, 1x HMDI, 1x SD card slot, 1x Headphone jack, 2x USB A, and thats 8 YEARS AGO.<br>So basically only USB C missing. Even though the new model is pretty nice (and expensive) - kinda disappointing that there is no USB A for whatever reason. Apple really wants you to buy their mouse and not any other.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m45s">8:45</a> K but, Why you got a douche on display tho??
Had mine for a week and, well... it sure is speedy. 🔥
that is pretty impressive, shoutout to apple
Big notch might be reserving space for depth sensor in later editions?
This man is a fucken legend
Next level
Do you guys think we will see the Touch Bar come back maybe even above the function keys it was really useful for screenshots and even emojis etc
Great intro music, but the mac 2021 animation was not that good
Lmao, using the Pixel in the Mac video. Love it.
Apple is saving higher end ports for the next Keynote, otherwise they won&#39;t have any filler features to announce on the next model.
Why am I watching this when I know I can’t afford it 🤷🏾🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾🤷🏾‍♂️!
Second that. I also finally can confidently recommend a MacBook as alternative to everyone asking me about what to buy for a laptop.
Evil Apple .. they purposely put downgraded ports on the laptop so you would buy the next generation which will again not have any ports
We all better hold Marques responsible for wearing socks and sandals when the 2022 MacBook pro has a notch.
I’m a student with high gpa do a lot of MATLAB programming can I please have your travel iMac Pro? Please!!
Dope intro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Woohoo, another Mac lover. Can&#39;t get enough of those.
My M1Max has been stuck in China for 2 days. This is supplementing my craving to play with it
How about the speaker ??
I don&#39;t get why everyones defending the notch. Weather apple put it in because they see it as part of their brand (btw, that&#39;s the STUPIDEST thing to align your brand with but whatever), or because you think it&#39;s not that bad, it&#39;s still worse then if there hadn&#39;t been a notch. Like, people keep saying it&#39;s only cutting into the extra display you didn&#39;t have before? I&#39;D RATHER HAVE THE EXTRA DISPLAY WITHOUT THE NOTCH IN MY 3000 DOLLAR LAPTOP THANKS.
So..for upgraded ports we have to wait another year.
MacBook Pro Dongleless Edition
I am definitely in the minority but the new macbook pro is terrible in my opinion. The notch alone if unforgivable. It&#39;s thick, heavier, noisier and less portable. Only the addition of ports is positive. Sorry but this is terrible. PLEASE APPLE do NOT add that ridiculous notch to your upcoming new displays. The notch is the worst part of the iphone - stop exporting it!!!
nah this kind of performance feels illegal 🧍🏾‍♀️
Great review!  I&#39;m looking forward to receiving my M1 Max that should be here in a couple of weeks!
Honestly this is the most I&#39;ve been excited for any piece of tech since...maybe my first iPod?
Another device that I can&#39;t afford
Finally…!!<br>Comment first, watch later 😅
soooo happy. thanks Apple
&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals, like Linus&quot; spoken like a punishment 😂






I refuse to accept the &quot;need&quot; for a notch on the laptop. Either give me a top bezel and a webcam worth using, or don&#39;t give me a webcam
Damn, that intro
The notch on the iPhone is a massive eyesore that&#39;s constantly distracting. It&#39;s just the worst and I <b>HATE</b> it.<br><br>On this laptop though, it doesn&#39;t bother me even a little bit. The notch is such a tiny fraction of the screen and it&#39;s not hiding anything I care about. Would the laptop be better without it? Yeah, but only slightly.
these intros are getting mind-blowingly &quot;next level&quot; too
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=3m50s">3:50</a> what in the color correction was that?
Had this sitting in our Amazon cart just waiting for this review… *clicks Buy Now
That MacBook looks like a Surface
I don&#39;t think the slow waveform loading in Final Cut Pro is a RAM limitation, as lots of people have been reporting slow waveforms as a result of the latest update to Final Cut (10.6). I think it&#39;s a bug/regression, and hope it gets fixed soon in the next minor update.
🤯
"“…so they&#39;re now water resistant”
<br>
<br>Yeah my macbook pro has gone through the washer twice and amazingly still works. Definitely the best laptop I’ve ever had."
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m24s">12:24</a> I can’t wait for that day lol
IT IS HERE. FINALLY!!
&quot;Congratulations To Everyone who comes in Every single Seconds &quot;
the prices of these new macs are also next level. Can&#39;t believe they went back on their decisions on the ports and the touchbar and the price still managed to be this disgusting.
You can finally save on luggage now that you don&#39;t need that travel iMac! 🤣
Where is the USB-A port???
Take your &quot;Before an hour&quot; badge ⭐
Maxbook Pro
The Final Cut Pro  missing audio waves is bug on the app. I encountered this problem after I updated to the latest version (the version where the object tracker was released)  <br>I use m1 mac mini and edit on 1080p but still this happens. Maybe a fix on the next update
everyone is more hyped that you&#39;re reviewing it, not the actual machine lol
fridge
Mind blown 🤯 I wonder how intel responds to this
MKBHD is the Nword I wanna be<br>Fuckin A - Alpha male
How suprised will we be when the space grey magsafe cable is sold separately for $50
FINALLY
I hope apple will put M1 max for iPhone 14.
FINALLY
About damn time mkbhd 🔥
A new &quot;top notch&quot; design. Good one!
In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m09s">17:09</a> you have M1 Pro MBP twice, you mean M1 Max MBP
I can’t decide between a base M1 pro and an M1 Macbook Air. I really like the 120hz mini LED display and additional ports on the new Macbook pros, but i don’t know if it justifies the extra money.

oh god, that notch is ugly
where did you get that groot &quot;plant&quot; ?
Is mkbhd is working for apple these days?
Just letting you know… you WILL be held to the socks and sandals….
Apple should hire you for intro vids
I would love to see you do something to compare these with equivalently priced windows 11 laptops once there are a few with 11th gen and ddr5
FINALLYYYYY!
We only waited for 437 years for the review video...🥲🥲🥲🥲
I bought the 14&quot; 10/24 M1 Max with 1TB and 32GB. The p e r f e c t middle-ground on what is a crazy laptop. Mac is Back, Baby!
was waiting for this one
Perfect!!!! I’ll wait for M5 or something to release, so i can afford this one🤘🙏
The spatial audio in the intro was 🔥
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m00s">17:00</a> the on screen text says M1 Pro MBP twice instead of M1 Max MBP for the faster time.
ALmost 15 million subs! Congrats Marques!
IVE BEEN SO EXCITED FOR YOUR REVIEW
i think its just me, but i prefer thinner macbook with less ports , coz i rarely connect it with anything
The video we have all been waiting for!
Marques: &quot;I&#39;m not sure why the space grey laptop doesn&#39;t also come with a space grey magsafe connector... that would&#39;ve been a nice touch&quot;<br>Apple: <b>Takes notes</b>





Hey everyone! :D I hope you stay safe and have a nice day, God bless you! &lt;3
And now say MKBHD is not a Apple shill
Yep, these things are beasts!! Especially when you are coming from an Intel MacMini.
Most awaited review thanks man .
now they are going to take the pc market for good
I waited for this video like an Air Jordan drop!
Likely the most coveted review on the new MacBooks, EVER. That intro is yet again, NEXT LEVEL!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a> The reason they made a notch so big without Face ID is that apparently they have issue to have censors right now. And if they would have a small notch and then the next generation would have a bigger notch to accommodate the Face ID censor, everyone would focus on Apple “increasing” the notch size, instead of focusing on Apple including Face ID. So they made the notch for the size it would supposed to be with Face ID censor for when they could include it. So when they would do it, people could only say; “ok, now there’s Face ID”, omitting anything about the notch size.
Finally!!!
I can&#39;t even afford it.... Why am I watching the full review 😶
marques intro quality rivals apple trailers
I could care less about the new macs. I’m just watching cause the editing &amp; review is the gold standard
a delayed review but a honest one so far.. <br><br>While others ripped and turned their channels with hundreds of reviews, some of us were waiting for your word. <br><br>Thank you MKBHD.. really.. no pun intended.. really worth the watch..
Man I was waiting for this
God tier intro!!!
I’m glad this wasn’t rushed. The wait was definitely worth it.
The new M1 chips are great because now both Intel and Amd will be forced to improve their historic chips. Competition at its finest 💪
im just scared that apple will hire Marques&#39;s production team , like damn those are smooth.
Finally the review I&#39;ve been waiting on.
Claim your “here within 1 hour” ticket here 🎫
The intro was 👍👍👍👍👍
a single usb-a port would&#39;ve been great
Highly anticipated Review 👏🏾
Finally ❤️
Where’s the Mac Pro Video 😄.
Everything is great except that fuckin notch 🤮🤮
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> minor text mistake there
watching this on my m1 max 32 gb, just for watching streaming series and movies, I love it
I can’t wait until reviewers give their honest honest review about these pieces of craps. So disappointing, people are way too overexcited about having the ports back, while the whole competition already has them, still. I would honestly use a chrome book which I already do




Been waiting for your review.. :)
NEWSFLASH:  Apple didn’t give you (us) the following:<br><br>1. Ethernet<br>2. HDMI 2.1<br>3. Card 3<br>4. Face ID<br>5. Centerstage<br>6. 5G<br>7. Anti Glare Screen<br><br>Because those are your built in upgrades for the next 5 years including 10% lighter, thinner, faster - and  10% more spread legs by the presenters (what’s up with that)?
TOP NOTCH DESIGN🤣🤣🤣
Nice!
Unbelievable how fast this thing is, Apple outdid themselves.
Great intro yet again but the one you did for the pixel 6 was just <b>chef&#39;s kiss</b>
I’ve been eagerly waiting for this one.
I BEEN WAITING SO LONH
the review that everyone was waiting for, certainly did not disappoint. i’ve personally ordered the base 14” (and by topping up SGD$14 for the 96W charger; which also extended the delivery date to 3-4 weeks later 🥲) as i think it’s already beastly enough for what i’ve intended to use it for. &amp; after watching this review, i’m sure i picked what’s sufficient for me. however, it’ll be fun to also have a review for the base 14” instead of the 10-core one that everyone has. thanks mkbhd, i stan you all the way from Singapore.<br><br>(Edit: I am upgrading from a mid-2014 MBP, so it’s really gonna be a drastic change for me)


I&#39;ve never clicked on a video faster than this one. Thank you!!
&quot;...like Linus&quot; Lol, perfect.
I&#39;ve never liked apple computers myself.
In a pinch, one less dongle of a video
Finally! now i can wait in peace lol thanks for the awesome review.
"I&#39;ll wear socks in sandals for a day. Like Linus.
<br>Apple: Prepare to buy a pair of socks and sandals as we&#39;ll keep that notch as it is now just to see you do that."
Literally waiting to hear your thoughts before buying, that 14-inch size seems ideal for me
I heard it&#39;s really good for programing
I’m most excited that you can get the smaller 14” with the same specs as the 16”.<br><br>Previously the smaller MacBook Pro had less cores and less max ram.

Having fast charge is great, and I&#39;m happy that those mag-safe cables are completely modular since Apple cables are notorious for disintegrating. Buy extras, people!

Apple literally,  wiped the industry
I can only imagine how much you&#39;re itching to see what they end up doing with a Apple silicon Mac Pro
Waited so long
Does it have the rubber piping all around the screen? That really sucks. Mine is falling apart merely because I clipped handwritten notes on the screen and pulled the clip off..
I used that intro song in a video a couple years ago. So weird to hear it haha
I’m not sure why but I’m not digging the design this year
no thanks. Nvidia and AMD gaming PC is way better than this overhyped mac
I feel so stupid. I got a 16in MacBook about 2 months ago and apple just wants to give me half of what I paid for.   This sucks so much 😭


It&#39;s almost 2022 and people still buy and use laptops, lol
Been waiting for this video!!!
this is hands down the best piece of technology available for consumers. Insanely impressive.










So am I the only one who can&#39;t afford it ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=00m39s">00:39</a> Good God, this guy carries an iMac.
Big fan
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=20m17s">20:17</a> chef&#39;s kiss 😘
Did you select me for when your monthly giveaways?

WHAT IF ? Marques Replies To This COMMENT?
Been waiting for this
No, that INTRO was TRULY Next Level ✨
I was wondering why MBKHD was only reviewing Sony and Apple headphones when he has a Beyerdynamic headphones.
Great mention on the headphone jack impedance! Not many have
I have been dying to hear what you thought about the new laptops! 🙌
Apple just give me a graphics card and I will change in a heart beat
People use this way too often, but his really does seem to be a game changer. I<br>Wintel folks are legit considering making a move to Macs now.
the editing tho
Does it have the rubber piping all around the screen? That really sucks. Mine is falling apart merely because I clipped handwritten notes on the screen and pulled the clip off..
what are the odds of getting a honey ad by Marques on Marques&#39;s video.. coz I&#39;ve just got one
About time lol
This is what i waiting for!!.
I&#39;ll hold you to your words Marques - &quot;Ill wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus&quot; if the next design does not include Face ID 😂
IT&#39;S FINALLY HERE.
I am an older person that uses Mac and I am glad they brought back the SD slot and the HDMI.
How would ethernet work on an adapter that plugs to the wall?
Oh I’m early
It&#39;s the one I was waiting for
It&#39;s finally here! Thanks MKBHD.
i see what you did there Marques, “top notch” design 😂
Isn’t the reason for the return of the ports because the new M1 chips allow for much more room inside the unit so there is now real estate available for the ports?  I don’t think it’s 100% them going backwards, they finally had the room to retain design and add the ports again.
I don&#39;t use that much taskbar space anyway so I&#39;ll take it for a better camera
Truly twice as good for twice as expensive! Imagine that!
I swear, If I hear the &quot;top-notch&quot; pun one more time...

Intro was 👌
Advance happy 15m subs🥰
I purchased the base model and honestly its a beautiful laptop but my 2021 12.9in iPad Pro is more than enough so ill be returning it. Plus I am leaning towards the Surface Laptop 4 with AMD Ryzen 7 model in Matte Black with 1TB since I like having the productivity as well as a gaming machine that can play triple A titles on the go.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=19m35s">19:35</a> baby groot in the background
I see a gmmk pro, keyboard vid!!!!
Finally i&#39;ve been waiting for weeks Marques!
I am just a college student that uses my MacBook Air to do my homework, and I want to upgrade lol
This is QUITE a jump.. Never expected this from a company who puts 120Hz display as THE thing in their PRO Max phone.. 😅
Happy Diwali
Great review as always.
BOUT TIME
I am a pc guy, and unbiasedly I am saying if you could run Windows 10 or 11 on this thing it would be everyones dream.
Finally ❤️🔥
Error @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m09s">17:09</a> the last time should say M1 MAX MBP, it says M1 PRO MBP right now
Is thunderbolt 4 USB-C?
I see the next MacPro being on the M1 max
Finally a worthy upgrade/replacement for my MacBook Pro late 2015
Those first couple of intro shots rival Apple’s CG generated reveal video clips. Kudos!!
So, you know how you stare at someone when they’re gorgeous and can’t help yourself till their voice breaks that stare and almost startles you right? That’s what MKBHD intros feel like to me till you hear that classic line.

I be waiting this video for so long...
DUDE C&#39;MON!!! THESE INTROS ARE TOO MUCH FOR MY EYES TO HANDLE!! It was awesome 🔥🔥🔥love u marques 💙
took your damn time no offense
Been waiting forever for this
ngl I actually think that the Apple notch on their products are really cool
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> the bottom one is M1 MAX MBP 😂
Something is wrong with the audio.
Wish it was DisplayPort instead of HDMI
next level computing! couldn’t help but notice how shaky some of these shots were though
“the top notch design” - touché marques. Touché.
design language to have a notch?!! What the...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=16m25s">16:25</a> &quot;Of course m1 Max ONLY has 64 gigs of ram&quot;<br><br>&quot;The mac pro I edited on had 768gb of ram&quot;<br><br>Me with my 4gb: yeah that seems enough
Assuming Apple doesn&#39;t have complete ownership over magsafe or magnetic connectors but why didn&#39;t it become mainstream I feel like it&#39;s a neat feature. Did it have a low power limit my power brick for my laptop is 230 watts could a magnetic connector safely and efficiently transfer that power?
A Mac Pro the size of a fucking laptop. Incredible.
These things are crazy
That&#39;s the Pelican 1660 if anyone is wondering
How did you even pack the Mac 🖥 that’s crazy
not Marques carrying an iMac like its luggage 😂😂😂
wouldnt mind seeing ipad pro review
Is there a typo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a>? The bottom M1 Pro should be M1 Max.
So only final cut users should upgrade. Got it
Marques your production quality is excellent
FINALLYYYYYY
and i’m still using a 2013 mac air lmao
yess
Top notch design lmao
&quot;A new top notch design&quot; I get it :)
This is the review I have been waiting for!!!
Finally ,😌😌
Let’s see everyone try to bitch about this video… lol
Its about damn time
The long awaited review 👏👏👏









He’s had this set up for about a year
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m02s">17:02</a> Shouldn&#39;t the last one be &#39;M1 Max MBP&#39;?
Yessssss it’s alive!!!!
I like the way how you can individually select the sub videos so no need to find it via time on the main video. Very good job.
I travel with the M1 Mac MINI, now it can retire too :)<br>Once you edit on a M1, there is no going back.

















finally, the only review i&#39;ve been waiting for : )
That intro was worth the wait
Love that pun on “top notch” design😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m08s">17:08</a> Little typo, should say &quot;M1 Max MBP&quot; where it says &quot;M1 Pro MBP: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=4m06s">4:06</a>&quot;
FIIINAAALLYYY!!!!
At
&quot;Just tools&quot; Nice to see that Dave2D and now Marques both decided to point out that these are just laptops and won&#39;t change your life. Unless you drag a full iMac with you everywhere you go
The most anticipated video. Finally!!!
The M1 Air suits my needs but I really want a bigger screen
one day i will purchase this, at the moment its too pricy to risk
out of the basket of fries, you are the lonely onion ring, because you are so unique, marques brownlee
intro itself....⚡⚡⚡⚡
@MKBHD - FINALLY!😅
I’ve been waiting for this
1st
10 BIT DITHERING FAKE 10 Bit
&quot;I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals like Linus&quot; HAHAHAHAHAHA
&quot;Design is &#39;top notch&#39;&quot; - I see what you did there ;)
It&#39;s about time
Finally! That took some time but glad your review is here!
Commented within 15 minutes of posting haha
watching this on my new 16 inch!<br><br>I love it so much
Apple was definitely nerfing the Intel MacBooks to make the arm update feel more significant.
Did anybody else catch Marques saying, &quot;Of course M1 Max has 64 gigs of RAM vs the Mac Pro has 768 gigs of RAM&quot;? SHEEESH he has more RAM than I have SSD space

Top Notch Design 😅
Next level notch is right
YESSSSSS
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=17m03s">17:03</a>: Oops, typo there. The last one had to be M1 Max MacBook Pro
Becuase of Marques I learned a lot of thinks about tech.
The M in M1 stands for Marques! 🔥🔥
Those intros don&#39;t make a statement 👀🔥
Finally, haha! Great video! Loved it.
Just when I was hoping for an upload, you bless us with a vid
I wish my car ran as fast as this
music trash
iMac 🤯😂 Legend
The intros are getting more and more fire each time.!!!!
Aaaaa one of the first k comments
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a> I&#39;ll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus LOL
Intel 12th gen i9 said hi
Receive Jesus as your Lord and savior! Repent and only  believe


fart&#39;
That intro made me wanna buy it 🥺
Too long
&quot;One less dongle&quot; 😄
Good morning india 🎆
Hey you know it’s been out for like two weeks already why are you just talking about it now???😡😡😡
I wish Apple would get rid of all their notches just for the simple fact that I’m so sick of people bitching about it. 🤬🤬🤬
Besssssssttttttttttttttttttt   Love from Bangladesh.
The Wait was Absolutely Worth It 😃!!!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m52s">12:52</a> incredible bird 🐦 drawings 😂
This is the review I have been waiting for long time finally it&#39;s out
Oh god, was looking for an excuse not to buy one. RIP to my money but my code is gonna compile so fast
I already know this video is going to be a banger. I liked it before even watching it
Why use an actual portable laptop or an iMac in a Pelican Case when you can buy the $700 Mac Pro wheels and carry that around 😎


Always the intros man..
Anyone have a Best Buy promo code or employee discount?
They’re damn sexy
They went back 4 years in time, even included old ports on the MacBook 😅 Apple being Apple, they always finds a way to screw something up so they could sell “the update” in the next model 🤣
Yeah I noticed the DAC was just ok.  Not as good as what&#39;s on MSI laptops.  Wonder what&#39;s Adam&#39;s thoughts on it
Joe?
I just built a high end gaming/productivity desktop PC. Should have gotten this instead 😭😭😭


They are better, but are they better enough to cost 3300$? You can buy some really good laptops from different brands for 1000$ max, 3 times that doesn&#39;t appeal me a single bit
I disagree on the MagSafe Ethernet idea. If anyone is doing something professional enough where they need to take advantage of wired speeds, they will be docking the computer and using it like a desktop. Adding an Ethernet port to the MagSafe would have made the MagSafe cable super thick, clunky, and the connector would have many more conductors that would be useless for the majority of users.
Top “notch” design.
Apple: &quot;We&#39;ll sell you overpriced old shit, and you&#39;ll still buy it&quot;



Ahhh yes the one I&#39;ve been waiting for
Apple should own your intro
It doesn’t support hdmi 2.1 because it can’t drive them.  That’s red flag number one<br><br>Need to wait for m2’s to be able to drive those
I’ve been waiting for this! 😅 by the way, intro song sounds like “Right Above It” by Lil Wayne ft. Drake.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=12m40s">12:40</a> I’ll wear socks and sandals for a day.. like linus 🤣
Marques is using this chip from last 4 years.
HDMI 2.0 in nearly 2022. Courage.
WOW IM SO EARLY!!! Been waiting for your video!
OH MY GOD THAT INTRO AAHHH THIS IS SUCH AN ORIGINAL COMMENT AHHH
Man, your graphics department deserves some love! What a beautiful intro
Switched my device from iPhone to Mac just to watch this documentary in 4K!
Thanks mkbhd and I think google is now using tensor for captions on YouTube
These things are for professionals who intend to recuperate their extremely high cost through work produced by them, but every Tom, Dick, and Harry claims to be picking them up like they&#39;re gaming laptops and web browsing machines.<br><br>It&#39;s weird.


LETS GO BRANDON
All the reviews of the new M1 Max chip might convince me to finally upgrade my 2012 Macbook Pro.<br>It&#39;d be an easier decision if only certain things weren&#39;t just soldered onto the logic board.

















Why are you kick intel even more by releasing it today xD
Anyone else tired of verified accounts commenting something short and random almost as soon as the videos are up? It’s just underhanded promo for themselves since the algorithm pushes verified comments to the top.
Wow groot is moving every frame you just need to look closely
finally!... i know y&#39;all we&#39;re thinking this when you saw the video in your inbox
My notebooks are worth like $10<br>MKbhd&#39;s Notebook computers are worth like $11,000
Great review
the notch sucks
That intro was 🔥🔥🔥, I wish apple put that intro in the event
Sandals like Linus LOL I love Marques&#39; relationship with Linus. Truly wholesome.
The one we’ve all been waiting for!
When they get rid of the notch and get a touchscreen, holla at me
Anyway you could to use the power Brick from the iMac 2021 on these M1X Pro Laptops, so you can use the Ethernet port…
Top notch design. I see what you did there ;)<br><br>Great video!
The irony of Apple removing, then re-adding the ports is like when Taco Bell removes the re-adds the nacho fries “by popular demand”








He had to put in the 2021 watermark because all macbook looks the same.
I swear apple is going to add a notch to every product
yeah!!
Marques, as a gay person I cannot get over what’s on your desk at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=8m40s">8:40</a> 😂
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=10m16s">10:16</a> top notch design 😂
Do more giveaways bro, you will reach 20mill sub&#39;s
Malayali like cheyyu
Why don&#39;t u make intros for apple?
&quot;top notch&quot; <br>ha.
What are ur thoughts on using this for CAD?
Nice vid.
Yeah but you can’t really make music 🎼 on it because of the m1 chip. PC for the win
OMG 😱 finally 😂
This is hilarious watching him so excited over an SD card slot. Apple probably added an extra $1,000 just to have that option to the consumer. So pro....Wow.

MKBHD 60s=3k views
Coool, very cool!
When will I ever get to be first? Urrghh
Knew you’ve been working hard on this one but bro I really appreciate the effort you put in your work 👏🏾
Ohh finally the wait is over, waiting for this video to get #1 in trending videos.
Love the new macbook
It’s  garbage , good for doing content things , but for other things … I would get a 2-1 laptop
Ready to watch this entire video for a product I&#39;ll never buy
Part of me wonders if we&#39;ll ever see CPU/GPU chips evolve to the point where efficiency is so high that passive cooling becomes standard in laptops and desktops. That would be my dream.




okkk the big man is finally reviewing this.......
“Top-notch design” 💀
first
Who here before 1/2 hour mark
Can you please make a video about best earbuds for someone invested in the apple ecosystems. I am wondering what earbuds to get, I would like noise cancellation but I don&#39;t know if I should pay extra for it. (anyone is welcome to comment if they have input I would appreciate it.)
Can&#39;t afford.. still watching🙌🏾
omg finally
Goddamn, I wish I could run Solidworks on these things. What a leap forward
“Top notch design” Marques, you have done it again. 😂






🔥
Finally!
Mentioning 2021 video and wearing 2019 tshirt. You got different swag.
M1 Brownlee: Truly Next Level
O
too bad they jacked up the prices. i was thinking maybe i could sell my M1 and pay a couple hundred more. but forget about that 😭
I have to be honest. This video seems rushed. I was expecting a bit more from the intro&#39;s ending, and typically you have more B Roll. Am I alone? 🤔
If the HDMI port was 2.1 (4K @ 120fps) it could have used the full potential of these MAC’s as it has 120hz screens

What&#39;s the point of that ugly notch on a laptop when there&#39;s enough space to put all of the sensors
I wonder if Marques knows how long the world has been waiting for him to make this review. 😭
oh dear.. I can&#39;t believe you were flying around carrying that huge pelican case with the iMac  😵
That MKBHD Tee though 😍
Well worth the wait!!!!
That intro 🔥
You really love your Instax
Throwback intro song
So when are you going to start directing movies?

The intro tho🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Yesssss
Lol mac got a notch
The new Macbooks are now 6k!<br>What the screen?<br>No the Price
Mkbhd is the new shopping channel ... <br>Just go work for apple by this time your review looks and feel pre paid
Hi
The video we were all waiting for
I thought maybe he might have been using the M2 MacBooks for a few weeks now...
I am 🇮🇳
Nah this laptop is garbage with that notch lol
No sub 😓
I watched the intro twice
FINALLY!

macbook commercial quality intro 🔥🔥🔥
Was waiting for this masterpiece of a review
Worth the wait.

Ayo Marques, hope you are having a fun and exciting day cause this looks fire dawg 🔥

ggg<br><br><br>ggg
Intel took a body blow last year… this year Apple knocked them out.  I expect next year’s releases to be the Zombieland Double Tap… just to make sure Intel doesn’t get back up again








Honest question…why do you need to record such high quality video? Isn’t YouTube capped at 1080p? Certainly it doesn’t support the video quality that you shoot in right? Like I said, I could be completely wrong, just seems like a lot of computing power for YouTube videos.

Bout time lol I been waiting all week for this
“Top notch design”😂
&quot;A new top-notch design&quot;<br><br>I see what you did there
Nice review 👍
Video got posted 6 min ago yet people already claim to have watched the whole 22 min video 🧐
4 minutes 25k views 😱😱
Im glad that Apple made a push for USB C which made other companies do the same. If it wasn’t for apple, not as many products would be USB C these days.
“Top notch” design ….😂😂😂
What a Mind-Blowing Start to a Weekend!

WHAT A SICK INTRO
That intro is what took this video so long to drop lol
New &quot;top notch&quot; design. Well played.
That MacBook is lookin THICCC
Finally 🔥
Finnally, The Macbook Review
I just canceled my order for one of these aha
Really like your videos made a lot of purchases on recommendation
Not first.
Finally. It&#39;s time.
love your vids
It sucks that the YT version comes before the Nubula one!
Is it worth buying
Been waiting for THIS one!!! Lets gooooooo!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the one we’ve all been waiting for. LFG! Also Siiick intro 🔥🔥
me: thats so dope, i want that<br>my wallet: no
second
You know they actually make backpacks specially shaped for transporting iMacs. It&#39;s way less bulky than that pelican case (though probably less protective, but mine&#39;s been good enough). My grandma bought me one when I was in high school. I used it to bring my iMac to a robotics competition and Steve Wozniak was there and I got him to sign my iMac.


I love my new 16” MBP. The screen and sound are standouts. My one complaint - it’s REALLY beefy and thick. Feels Tim Cooke, not Jobs/Ives design-wise.


Very glad you tested the high impedance headphone jack… mostly no youtuber does…
STAY AWAY FROM THIS MACBOOK IF YOU ARE A PRODUCER OR DO MUSIC!!!!! The OS is NOT compatible with all plugins and programs!!!
Well worth the wait
Bout dang time
Seriously, is this a review or sponsored Apple advertisement? <br>Americans can only see one brand in their arrogance, Apple. 😂😂
Wow! 🤩 I was waiting for this video since the launch 🚀 Everyday checking the channel for new videos.
SO I saw you posted this video 3 minutes ago and I just had to fill myself a cup wine before I watched it lmaoo that&#39;s how much I enjoy your reviews 😂
&quot;Top notch&quot; design... I see what you did there
Ayyeee Sub 5 min squad 🤙🏾🤙🏾🤙🏾
FINNALY!!!!
You’re truly next level 👀
Am I missing something? Why does he have to carry the iMac... Why can&#39;t he remote into the machine?
yesssssss i&#39;ve been waiting for this, for so long
SUB 😿
Been waiting to hear your thoughts on the new Macbooks :)





what kind of maniac travels with imac lol..
Was waiting for this video the whole week! 😂
apple be like:this is the best laptop
Just watching something I will never be able to afford
Wow
Great video bro!
FINALLY
These intros just keep getting better and better. Thought I clicked on an ad




























I love how the MKBHD solution to shooting and editing on the road was not to sacrifice 8K video or anything like that, it was just brining a whole iMac<br><br>We&#39;ve come a long way lol



If the macbook can support catia and solidwork i will guarantee buy it tho
Fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yooooo
Ahhh, yes! The MacBook Pro Classic review.

SO PUMPED FOR THIS REVIEW
I have a MacBook Air 2016 do I upgrade to this?
I honestly feel that people (myself included) have been waiting for this with as much expectation as Apple’s own event….Maybe they should just give MKBHD 1hr and make THAT the event?! I’d be happy! I trust you more then then!!!
Very dissapointed with the performace 😪 I expected more from Apple this time. Maybe next year. And that notch is a huge no go for me man 😒
Don’t know why I bought one of these, but it browses Chrome pretty well.

Been waiting for this vid!
This is so late I thought it was his M2 review for a sec
You can give me a macbook, I have an obsolete one since 2012 😢,<br>Greetings from Mexico City, I love your videos
watching this on the new macbook pro 14&quot;. My first laptop and its incredible.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr2XfL_df3o&amp;t=0m15s">0:15</a> It&#39;s the little details like matching the pitch of the charging sound to the key of the music that really sets your intros apart. Fantastic work!
Ports!  I hang onto my 2015 MBPs for the ports!  Plus the performance is still strong for audio work.  MBP Max on the way!  As are the goggles.

Finally! Lol
Remember when we had to put them in refridgerator to cool... now they can achive more perfomance without even turning the fan on. 😅
But can it run crisis
Marques should do a program and people can pay to sign up and learn to make all of these cool transitions and others with phones if you can’t buy a camera or the higher end people who can get a good camera because those shots and openings are so crispy clean and so smooth
👍🔥
I can&#39;t get over how much I love this computer.  as a content creater it has given me a new fire to create more
About damn time
Intros are next level
YES
wow
&quot;Top Notch&quot; design........good one Marques
I wanna use the new C to magsafe charger with my old 15&quot; Macbook Pro Mid 2012.
Finally
Three minutes ago !?!? Does the Jefe respond?
&quot;&quot;&quot; Let&#39;s Pray for those people who doesn&#39;t have food to eat on lock down and  for Corona patient &quot;&quot;&quot;💙💚💛💜❤️💖.
And The Intro is😍 NEXT LEVEL🤩!
He was like &quot;I gotta go in and make the first video for the Pro Max&quot;
Nice. Waiting for this! 😀
About fucking time.
YOOO

These intros just keep getting better and better
Looking to upgrade to M1 Max “16 fully spect out except storage
Finally

I don&#39;t understand the Notch haters, its a good display with a great camera and microphone. That&#39;s the price!


Brace yourselves.<br>Intel ads are coming 😂😂
The goat is here!
Ok
wow a laptop
Looking at the Notch here...i dont see apple removing notch form iphone...maybe notch will be a apple thing in every device.. Apple is just that ridiculous.
Masterpiece intro 🔥🔥🔥
Notch
Apple actually allows us to connect HDMI! Love that upgrade!

Been waiting for this! Considering it, thanks bro
nice
I wonder MKBHD...does those not for resale shoes cost more than your review units of the M1 Max(es)??
Ok, last one before I sleep.
Your intro game is the best out there .. Hands down 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Here within 2 mins
Never really realized how influential MQBHD was to the tech here on yt until it took him this long to post the mac review!




Hey finally. Nice job once again.
Opened YouTube to check if this is ready and wow 1min ago.
Finally. The review!
That intro tho!
You dont have to be going this hard on these intros but im glad you are, love to see them🔥

FINALLY!!! LESGOOO
This is the way
a week late and yet still the best
Quite sensitive impressions, looking for custom fit, hard to get,  but able to adjust
Can u boot camp windows on it?
I watched MKBHD review, now I can buy it 😜
This review was more awaited than the MacBooks themselves. lol.
finallyyyyyyy
Finally!
Omg I’ve been waiting for this keep up the great vids love what your doing don’t stop the grind
Alltta is back
&quot;They&#39;re just tools&quot; <br>Say it LOUDER for the people in the back
Watching one minute since upload. I&#39;ve never been this early!
The only channel I get my tech advice from. GOAT.
MKBHD&#39;s tech review is the GOLD STANDARD no offense to other youtubers
watching on a late 2013 15&#39; MacBook pro and it&#39;s got the SD card and hdmi port, would be nice to switch to the new one but these are overkill for me :]
Marques intro&#39;s  never failed to amaze me
I actually think the notch make it beautiful !


Finally.. I feel the touchbar could be found useful if Apple didn&#39;t use it as a replacement to the function keys. Have the function keys but give us a touchbar at the top.. I am sure they can find space there....
The long awaited video is now come upon us.
Finally
I would prefer 16 inch over 14 but i have no money to buy either
Mu most awaited video from mkbhd for this year cant tell how long I waited for this one. Finally 🙏
I&#39;m trying to find a way to justify spending thousands on a 16&quot; mbp. I want one.

I recently migrated to Apple after many years using a wide variety of PCs running Windows or Linux. I decided to make that move after Apple's introduction of the M1 processor, which has been proven to be an excellent hardware platform. Now. of course, the M2 has been released, but, depending on your needs, the 2020 Macbook Air with the M1 will save you some money while still delivering outstanding performance and some of the most attractively and perfectly manufactured hardware. You can search the Internet for professional reviews of the Macbook Air, but I feel confident you'll find plenty to verify what I'm saying.The Retina display is beautiful. The sound system is superior to any other laptop I have owned or used. The battery holds up all day under typical use, and I can verify that the battery holds its charge well for at least a week while the notebook is powered off. The Apple OS (Monterey) is smooth and fast, and I was able to learn my way around in it quickly. When you need help, a Google search will yield tons of tips quickly, or you can avail yourself of Apple support.I will say that the Air is a little short on USB ports, lacks a built-in card slot, and, of course, is not equipped with a touchscreen. However, I have run a USB hub from one of the two Thunderbolt ports, and there seems to be enough power to support my flash drives and card readers...even a portable DVD-burner. As far as a touchscreen goes, I have that on a Dell laptop I run Linux on, but I never use it...guess I'm a mouse or touchpad guy.The aluminum housing is beautifully machined and finished, the keyboard has a very nice touch, the battery seems to charge quickly, and the Air is light at under 3 lbs.One last thing! I have been a heavy user of both Google and Microsoft services, and I have found that Apple provides ample support for integrating those services into the Mac environment. I run Google's Backup and Sync and Microsoft's OneDrive with no problems. My AVG subscription allows me to use my antivirus software on both Mac OS and Windows machines.I have no regrets for this purchase. Actually, the Air was my 3rd M1 Mac. I also have an iMac and a Mac Mini. They all work together very well!
This is my first macbook and thank you for changing the shipping restrictions, I was able to buy one. I am still adjusting with the keyboard and the OS coming from a long time windows user. The battery life is amazing. Better than my windows laptop. Hopefully I can buy the higher specs next time, I don't mind paying the tax. I originally wanted to get the 16gb ram and 1tb storage, but it doesn't ship to my location. And thanks for the fast shipping.
I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect.Good:- SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness.- KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes.- BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far.- LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight.- NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans.- PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27" (top end) with Intel chips.- TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point.- APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth.- BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1.NOT GOOD:- WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera).- ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port.- NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release.- BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum.OVERALL:A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!
As many others have shared, the Apple MacBook Air M1 is a great laptop. The display is gorgeous. The keyboard is accurate and smooth. Apple has the best trackpads! Battery life is so good that there is no anxiety over having enough power to finish the day.The setup experience is so good with Apple products. All I had to do was choose my language and connect to wi-fi and then moments later the laptop was ready for me to login.The laptop integrates so well with the other Apple devices. Although I wonder why it wanted my iPhone's lock screen passcode. I am not sure how secure I feel that my iPhone's lock screen password is shared over the air with the laptop... Otherwise the MacBook Air is a great device for consuming content and for light-creative work.
I bought this MBA for my wife for Valentine's Day, and she has been in love with it ever since. She thinks it was the best Vday gift that she has gotten in years, it does everything so well!
I bought this 2020 MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage) to replace a 2014 MacBook Air (4GB RAM, 256 GB SSD storage).  I am undeniably a fan of Apple products in general, because they work with little fuss and are built to last (note that my old MacBook Air is more than 7 years old and still working perfectly).  Although I've been underwhelmed by some Mac models in recent years, this one is stellar IMHO.  Unless you have very heavy system requirements this machine would be an excellent choice.The M1 processor is very impressive, delivering outstanding performance and power/thermal efficiency simultaneously.  Battery life is every bit as good as advertised; I can charge overnight and use it all day without plugging in.  Connecting USB devices such as external drives will shorten battery life, but that's to be expected.  I love the fanless design, which means the machine is absolutely silent at all times, while the thermal efficiency of the M1 chip allows it to remain amazingly cool.  In use, this computer feels very fast, especially with apps optimized for Apple processors (as MacOS Big Sur is).  Interestingly, Microsoft has been on board early with M1 optimization; the latest Office 365 version is smooth and fast on this machine.  I also tried out MS Edge on my new laptop based on a recommendation from another user and have been so pleased with its speed and efficiency that it's my current default browser.  The touch ID and Apple Pay capability is a welcome addition.The only cons I see are minor in my opinion.  Because RAM is integrated into the M1 processor, post-purchase memory expansion is not possible; if you think you'll need 16 GB of memory that model can be had from the Apple Store.  There has been criticism of the fact that this machine has only two ports, which is fair.  For me that's not insurmountable; I simply use a USB-C hub to provide additional connectivity.  I've read recently that some users have had certain hubs cause problems with their M1 Macs, which appears to be related to battery charging through these hubs.  To be on the safe side I use a built-in port for charging and have had no issues.Reading through the relative handful of critical reviews, it looks to me like most (excluding actual defects, which happen with all products) are based on lack of understanding.  For example, I saw a large number of reviews complaining that this machine "has NO USB PORTS!!!", which is patently false.  In fact, its two ports are both USB, they just require a different connector.  What these users are looking for is the old USB-A connectors, which this MacBook does not have; however, that's easily fixed by using a USB-A to USB-C converter cable, or with a USB-C hub.  USB-A peripherals are gradually disappearing as well, in favor of the new connector.All things considered, I really love this machine.  The $899 price (at the time I bought mine) was $100 less than I would have paid at the Apple Store, and I believe I can probably get $200 on eBay for my old MacBook Air (try that with a 7-year-old PC!) leaving me with a total outlay of $699.  Considering that I'll almost certainly get 5 or more years use out of this model, I'm very happy with my purchase and would do it again.
I bought "used" but MacBook Air looks NIB (new in box) New for $752.39. I very happy with purchase
Decent laoptop but PCs offer greater functionality for the $1K+ price tag. Performance and speed average when considering the price.
Perfect size to carry anywhere!  I love this small laptop. The screen quality is great and touch screen is easy to use!
Took my chance and bought one used off Amazon warehouse deals. It's brand new except the warranty has only a few months left. Can't complain at all! This computer is awesome as I upgraded from 2013 Macbook Pro Retina. It's way faster. But 8GB of ram will be slow at times, and the laptop gets hot during summer months. Also the trackpad has a tendency of dragging instead of clicking when you're clicking around really fast. Like when you're trying to get that hot concert ticket, and you click really fast on Ticketmaster, it drags the text or link instead of clicking on it like it should which causes a second of two of delay. I hope they get this fixed but it's unlikely they will ever notice this. Most people don't use trackpad to click as fast as me.
Light, fast, and intuitive...happy with the product (disclosure: I'm an Apple fan)
Replaced a 10 year old MacBook pro (spinning harddrive, one-hour batter life, spinning beach balls).  Updates are smooth and backing up is seamless.  Able to set it up to limit the tech to just what she needs (right click, what does that do?).  She was very hesitant to get a new computer, as her old one "works".  6 months later, she said she wouldn't go back.  Its light with a for-ever battery life.  Thanks, Apple!
Really good
I have had this computer for a while now and it has yet to let me down. I love it.I would recommend this as a college student.
I bought this for my wife as I am a PC guy and this is a first impression review.  Like all things Apple, it is nice to look at with a sleek design and the screen that is sharp and clear.  I always read the negative reviews and a lot of folks complained there were no USB ports.  This isn't entirely true, it says it comes with 2 USB C ports and it does.  A simple thumb adapter ($5) is all you need to use a regular USB device.  HOWEVER, I was expected an SD card slot that is not there.  That was disappointing but, again, an adapter can solve that.  My wife loved the fact that almost as soon as she connected to our network, it almost instantly transferred everything from her phone and 10 year old MacBook.  So far, she is pleased with this purchase.  Additional items needed:  Clear protective cover and screen protector $16, adapters $10, MS Office Home for Mac, $149.
New to Apple...So far screen is great.
it arrived very well and quickly
I decided to take a chance with MacOS and the at the time of purchase discounted Macbook Air. At first, I liked it a lot and was very impressed. However, over time, I quickly grew to dislike how strict MacOS is with installing things like an overbearing parent. While I personally didn't find this to be the laptop of choice, I cannot deny the excellent screen, insane battery life and great keyboard. The usage of the Macbook Air is too limited for what I use computers for, but for people with more basic needs or that use productivity apps constantly, it's an excellent selection. It just wasn't the all-rounded I had hoped it would be.
I'm a software developer and I've only used PC for my entire career. I've been using the windows subsystem for Linux and other Unix based shells for work for a long time and I've always had the desire to try development on a Mac.I assumed that it would be like any other Windows machine that's had the OS replaced with Linux, one of my favorite computers was a Lenovo with Ubuntu on it so that's what I expected.I bought a Surface Pro X which has an ARM based processor (ms sq1 chip) so I thought that I knew what to expect, I assumed that it would be frustrating that the majority of the software I used probably wouldn't work correctly but I have to say that Apple did so much better than Microsoft on this one. The M1 chip makes this $1,000 laptop feel like a $2500 laptop. I've only run into one application that couldn't run and the general online community recommended an alternative for me.the most difficult thing for me was getting used to the different keyboard layout but once I did, this laptop has been nothing short of a pleasure to work with and has replaced my Surface laptop 3 as my daily driver and primary software development machine.I might revert to my Surface laptop three if I go back to .NET development in the future but for the general web stuff I typically do, I couldn't ask for a better machine.The battery life is excellent, this laptop feels premium, I have no doubt that this will last me well into the future and it has completely changed my mind about Apple.The biggest downside in my opinion is that I spent a fortune on accessories and peripherals because Apple products tends to exist in their own separate ecosystem which can be a bit frustrating.One thing that everyone should be aware of is that you can't connect this laptop to two separate external displays. I had to get used to One external display and then using a virtual desktop. That is unfortunate because I really liked having three monitors at all times but I haven't found a way to make it work with this machine.Generally speaking, I would recommend this to anybody who's considering it. Unless you are a PC gamer, there's very little that this computer won't excel at. I'd argue that it might be the best quality laptop in this price range by a factor of two, and I have historically been very critical of Apple.
I have had the M1 MacBook Air 13-inch now since December 2020. It has served me so well and has been one of the most reliable laptops I've ever owned. I am originally a PC guy and now work back and forth between Windows OS and Mac OS.When it comes to rendering videos and clips, this does a way better job at 4K resolution compared to my former Alienware 17 inch laptop AND my workplace's gaming desktop!I am pretty happy with the battery life so far. I have been getting 10+ hours of hard real-world usage. I bring a nice USB-C portable battery with me to charge it when I am doing work on the weekends out of town or while on the plane. This thing has not failed me once.8GB of RAM is more than enough for the majority of consumers and is enough for me even though I edit photos and videos all the time. I have not seen any "throttling" from the M1 MacBook Air since ownership. I can even open up 30+ tabs on Chrome without issue.256GB storage is enough as long as you have an external storage. I highly recommend investing in getting an SSD or NVMe external storage so transfer speeds are optimal. Otherwise, as long as you are keeping the core hard drive tidy, you won't run into any storage issues.Virtual classes are nice. The webcam quality is crystal clear, and it is noticeably better than most of my peers.My only complaint is that the design is a bit "outdated" despite how premium and beautiful it is.Just FYI. I just bought two of these; one for myself and one for my friend who just had a massive upgrade from her "prehistoric" 2010 iMac. She was absolutely mindblown by how much faster and better it is compared to the older iMac.Overall, this is a very nice all-around computer laptop for ANY student from K all the way up to the graduate level. Go get this beast of a machine now for $850.

Holy cow this is the best product I have ever owned no malicious baloney fast easy to use and very enjoyable recommends product I really do
I’m an APPLE user and not surprised with the functionality and quality
Recommended
When has an apple product ever done anyone wrong. They are known for their reputation, and this is no exception. Obviously reliable, great battery life, stunning pixelation, and works well for remote working.
Nice product, as usual for Apple!

I love my new MacBook. It convenient, advanced technology, light weight and all of my apple devices are connected!
This is a great laptop that is thin and durable. I would recommend a skin or case due to how lightweight it is!
This works fine but I had to buy separate adapter to read thumb drives. Also bought  external hard drive and DVD player. All the extras run up the overall price.
We bought the laptop in Dec 2021. After a couple of weeks, it had a big OS update: Big Sur to Monterey. The problems started happening - I kept getting locked out, passwords not working, account name not working - resulting to my having to run to the Mac Service Center 2x.The first time they said the update caused some issues. Second one said, it was a file vault issue.Also, noticed how since the update my battery life has decreased. The tech guys said this is normal after an update due to the machine still settling and should stabilize soon. It's been a couple of weeks and still the same. I've even heeded the advice of not logging out nor shutting down, just folding the laptop, to let the machine keep working on the kinks. Also because it's an M1 technology so no need to formally shut it down like a PC.Not sure of what's really going on, tbh.Perhaps it is due to Apples newest OS being buggy, or it could be the unit is a lemon. Not sure. But giving it one last chance and if it fails me again before the 90 day warranty is up, I am returning it.
It’s not my first MacBook, and the quality of it is up to standards.  My issue is that I bought it in June of 2022, and it says it was produced in 2020.  The title is misleading, it makes you think that it’s 2020 model.  I hoped it wasn’t sitting on the shelf for two years, but looks like it was.
Not long ago I decided to get far from Apple products because some work necessities I couldn't cover with an iPhone and a Mac. The limitation of the Iphone for some advanced features (like dual SIM and the possibility to flash OS images from a ssd) and the need to use bootcamp in the Mac made me jump to an android phone and a windows computer.I had a Samsung s10+ and a Huawei Matebook pro with windows and linux. Both devices are impeccable. Really made my work easier in so many aspects. But as time passed my life wasn't getting simpler like it was with my Iphone and my Mac.Apple products work flawlessly between each other and there are always new implementations that simplifies everyday life. Quality of this products and its software is incredible. Although other products have better capabilities ( for example my Matebook outperforms this MacBook Air m1 and has a much better quality screen) they lack the simplicity and stability.Being all this said, The MacBook Air M1 is a really great laptop. The most basic version which is the one I bought is blazing fast, stable and with a great battery life (much better than the Huawei Matebook pro). Also its absolute silent and fresh. Its doesn't get hot at all.To make my work easier I had to pay for some software that saddly I was denied to pay on the Mac at the beginning.  Apple products are expensive but I've learned that in the long run they are worth it. Life is about time and how you spend it and apple definitely focus its effort to simplify the time you use to do a task.I wanted to share my story in case you are in a situation like I had. If you have an iPhone and other Apple products don't doubt. Buy a Macbook Air M1. I still have a beefy windows machine for gaming, rendering, and other things. But most of the time I rather work in my new MacBook.
so nice
This arrived exactly as i expected. I live in Jamaica and this product was shipped straight to me. It arrived perfectly packaged without even the slightest scratch or blemish. Just know that if you were to purchase this product you are getting exactly what you expected. It works. No hiccups or hangups. It's just fast, smooth and a premium looking laptop. I cant say enough good things about this device. Just take care of it and trust that you will have a working computer for the next decade or more.  Get it!!
I like the shape, the weight,I dislike the material it is made of , and limited applications to install on it
I had a great experience.  I love my new computer!
Amazing quality from Apple. I was very sad to see some macbook airs go stray the past few years. Apple finally came back to its roots and built this masterpiece of a laptop. I have been a windows and mac user over the years, mostly being on windows. But the m1 has made it possible for me to make a complete transition. After going through laptops year after year, breaking down, and becoming outdated. I feel confident with m1 as my daily driver and I can run windows on it. Absolutely amazing. No reason to buy any other laptop right now.
It is exactly everything I wanted and I am so happy with my purchase!! I will definitely order again from this company!!
Great price and great computer!!
For the price and it apple product. I expected much more. Not able to download certain apps due to the small storage space on the laptop. Have to purchase an extra adapter for additional  USB ports.
This is honestly an excellent machine.Not even interested in discussing "cons" because there aren't any if you  weigh up the price point fairly for what is arguably the best ultra portable laptop on the market right now (July 21') and I don't mean the fastest.The "only two" thunderbolt slots can be dongled out to the max. If you want a second or third monitor setup, get any "display-link" certified hub like the Dell 452-BCYT D6000 Universal Dock (pricey) or the WAVLINK USB 3.0 Universal Laptop Docking Station,USB C to 5K/ Dual 4K @60Hz Video (cheaper).The 7 cores of GPU on this model won't be noticed vs 8 cores. The machine is a beast. I'm using Lumafusion to process video (not even designed for MacOS but ports across from iPadOS) and it's 3X as fast as the iPad Pro that I own - 2019Best laptop I've ever owned and I've owned two earlier MacBook pro's, a Mac mini, several windows laptops, and the Dell S2721Q 27 Inch 4K UHD monitor I purchased here is parked on top of the last windows machine I purchased.The 4K dell monitor is easily crisp enough for MacOS and I purchased the keyboard used and Magic Mouse (2) new, on Amazon.It's been a while since I've been on MacOS and would describe it as wonderful to use and look at, after coming from windows 10. Sidecar is also amazing (using the iPad Pro to the right for that)If you're shopping for a laptop or a Mac laptop, this is a good option.You'll love it. Nuff said.
They sent the wrong color, but it's otherwise great
Everything about this machine has been fantastic.  I could not afford new, but I have found this only a hairsbreadth less than spanking new.  Best for me, since I was away from the wonderful Apple side for several years, Apple help is as fine as the machine.  Plan to go this route next time.
I love this ease of transferring my data from my old Mac. It is a bit smaller though the screen is the same size so that’s nice. I’m not tech savvy so can’t say much about that aspect. My disappointment is that it doesn’t have a USB port like the old one for charging other devices on the side.
I love this little computer! When I was looking for a laptop to buy, I almost went with a used, older MacBook Air. I decided to just spend the extra money and get a brand new computer and the newest model and I’m so happy I did because Apple’s M1 chip is impressive. After two months of owning this laptop, I think my favorite thing is the battery life. For lighter tasks (web browsing, listening to music, steaming Netflix etc), the battery could last the entire day, and I love how I can take this thing anywhere with me without having to lug a charger around as well. For heavier tasks, it of course doesn’t last all day but you get a lot of hours out of the battery. It rarely gets hot, and doesn’t even have a fan, so you know how efficient that chip is running. I also love the fanless design because I can have it with me in my bed or anywhere and not worry about blocking vents or getting dog hair in those fans. I don’t use it for anything crazy, mainly just work and personal stuff, along with frequent streaming and occasionally I’ll fire up the Sims 4 (and it runs beautifully by the way). But I’m never not impressed by how quick it is, opens applications almost instantly and wakes instantly. Also, I am new to Mac with this purchase but have owned iPhones for a decade and I love the seamless integration jumping between applications on your laptop and phone. So far I’m loving Big Sur and basically this is just a laptop that would be great for almost anyone.
What I liked: Apple's construction quality is second to none. Unboxing this is a delight, it's just a beautiful machine. You can start working with it as soon as the initial setup is done, which might take a few minutes. Love the display, bright colors, nice resolution, everything looks crisp. Keys are a delight to type with, real smooth. Battery life is the best I've ever witnessed, I just recharge this thing every other day, whereas my previous laptop would use three rounds of charge a day (and I had for just one year).What I disliked: some of my favorite apps are still not ready for Apple Silicon or M1 chip. It's given me two or three random reboots with cryptic error logs already. And coming from over 25 years using mostly Windows (and some 2-3 years using Linux) I feel like I have to rewire my brain to start using the fn, control, option & command keys properly.All in all, it's a really solid laptop although I feel like I still haven't made the most out of it. No heavy usage so far, except for some minor audio production work. Guess I'll do it eventually. Hope app compatibility gets better with time too, that's the reason for the missing star up there, otherwise, it would've been 5-stars all the way.
I ordered gold and received silver. Disappointed and never got contacted by the seller about it but everything else is perfect
So far we have had no problems with it. We bought it for my daughter for college. If there are any hiccups come fall, I can resubmit.
The track pad for this machine is too smooth for me and gives my aging hands problems. And using the arrow keys to scroll doesn't work the same as my Chromebooks. I don't see where the Retina screen is in any way superior to my Toshiba HD Chromebooks.
Price point for an apple laptop good. Screen is great so are the speakers. Dead easy to set up. I had my last one for 13 years hope this is the same. Only negative. The new usb-c ( lightning ) does not support the apple super drive. You have to buy an adapter.
So for the most part I use this for when I am traveling or out and about for my business. I find it the right size for the job I am doing and take advantage of Apples cloud storage and ways of using other Mac's as storage for information so this doesn't use storage much at all. Where this is nice is the quick user functionality it has in access these documents or programs needed seamlessly and being able to help keep my business moving on the road. Most of the time I am using browser programs to access the business info or using the cloud to access files back at the home base which is the new Mac Mini with an external hard drive that houses the business information. I find that the size makes a great traveling companion for onsite work. When connecting to a shared internet connection it is nice knowing that the channel is mostly secure and when using my iPhone shares cell connection and new chips they can help create a safe network for my means of work. If you are debating getting one for business I recommend using their cloud storage so you eliminate the focus on storage anxiety and makes it more worth it in the long run of having a user interface focused laptop. Also the battery for most of the work I am doing lasts me a week with heavy workload 4 days max. Honestly you can't get too much better for a long lasting Apple hardware focused product.
good
I've had at least half a dozen mac laptops and as a non-pro the air is just what I needed. I replaced a Macbook Pro with the touch bar, the only Mac I've had which failed on me, and when I saw the price of new Macbook Pros I about fainted. I don't do graphics or video, I don't play games, I figured I'd just try the basic Macbook Air and see if it was fast enough. Bingo, it's great. New M1 processor is plenty for web surfing, daily use of the full MS Office suite with multiple windows open at the same time, video streaming etc. Battery life is terrific, I can work all day on a single charge! Sure there are people who need a "Pro" device but for the vast majority of us, even heavy daily usage, this is a spectacular computer.

Love this Mac.  Arrived fast and packaged well.  Works great and as a first time Mac user it was very easy to learn.  Great price at Amazon and very happy with the purchase.  The computer is very fast.
I was hesitant buying a MacBook, I said I'd never do it. But after having my iPhone for so long I and my most recent laptop dying, I figured I could take the chance. I love it, it is basically just an iPhone in laptop form. I will miss Microsoft Office Suite, but I don't really need it for that so it is ok.
I am overall very satisfied with my 2020 Apple MacBook Air purchase. Every works smooth and no problems so far. Powerful laptop. For now, I highly recommend.
I've worked on and serviced Macs for many years, but I've never considered purchasing one for the price. Macs have never been a good value. I wanted a $1000 laptop, and my choices quickly narrowed to this. It has the best laptop processor and the best screen money can buy, especially at this price. The battery life on MacBooks is always good, so I knew that wouldn't be an issue.After purchase, I've come to the same conclusions. The screen is wonderful. Bright and high res, excellent color accuracy. The M1 processor speed has blown me away with its performance. I don't need much RAM or Storage, so I'm still happy with that. I do wish for more RAM, but I don't necessarily need it for my work I do. What has blown my mind more than anything else is the battery life. I've never had a laptop like this. I don't have to carry a charger with me anymore: the MacBook easily handles a full day of charge. I also like the fact that it doesn't have a fan. I don't have to worry about thermals when getting comfy in my bed and doing some light work.Overall, best laptop I've ever purchased. I've had no issues over more than a month of ownership, and I'm super picky about tech as well as slightly anti-Apple, so I've basically converted because of this machine.
I've had and used iPhones from the beginning and had iPads since the iPad 2 but this is my very first Mac and I thought it might be a lot to learn this OS but things were familiar cuz I've used and owned iPads and iPhones.  I'm still having to learn a few things and had to Google questions on how to do somethings but it's been a good experience.  I really didn't expect that.  I love the OS BIG SUR and now can't wait to the next OS.  I only got 256gb cuz I didn't know if I would like this plus I knew i had to learn the OS.  Now, I'm waiting for the M2 Mac Book Pro, i plan to invest a lot more money into that one now I know that I like the Apple OS.  Looking at getting 2tb 32gigs of ram!  I like that it runs the apps from iOS or iPadOS!  I wish the screen was better though.  I'm talking at least mini-led but would prefer OLED for what I use it for.  Battery life is amazing! Camera quality sucks.  Come on Apple, give us the 2021 M1 iPad Pro camera and stop being so cheap!I'm happy with my purchase.  I will probably give this to my mom when the M2 MacBook Pro comes out!
all forms of establishing this computer to the correct running system et/al went smoothly except all the  passwords were defined in a not described format and the email program could not be connected as iCloud had my email buried within the demographics it contained. it took two hours with apple to be able to send emails as the computer did not allow my google email to connect . However it is a very beautiful computer...wow...what a ride and an amazing thing to experience the apple representative and how he went thru each and every system...very interesting.
I assumed the computer was new, I’m not sure that I did not get a renewed one. The computer seems fine so far, but the charger was defective, and I had to spend 30.00 on a new aftermarket charger. You would think the product would be tested. Not a great experience.
Just about the only thing I have objections to is that I don't really like the touchpad much. It doesn't always behave intuitively and I've had to tweak settings to get it to where I'm fairly comfortable using it.But generally... Solid laptop. Good buy.
Had an intel based MacBook Pro that supported 2 additional displays natively. This one only supports one. Luckily has a display link hub as a workaround fo 2 additional monitors. Had no issues with M1 silicon
No dislikes with this product.  Likes, it is easy to use and navigate which i loved from the start.
Wow!  came fast and brand new, thank you
It's a mac. That's literally the only reason I bought it to customize an app that was iOS compatible only. Outside of that, the Camera is horrendous (its giving very 2011 photobooth camera quality) and if you have too many browsers or apps opens it practically crashes. Not really worth the prices in my opinion. Just pay the premium for a macbook pro if the camera and performance is a make or break for you.
I was scared jumping from my 2020 MBP-16 to a MB-Air.  But I wanted lighter and figured I could carry both if I need the power of my Pro.  Ummmm, I don't need my Pro.  This thing blows my almost brand new Intel based MBP!  Now, there have been some anomalies with different apps and things.  No show stoppers.  But you can clearly tell which apps were updated for the M1 and which weren't  They work fine, but take a several seconds to open.One process I use it for is livestreaming our church services using OBS, and iPhone and a USB Audio device for the feed from the mixer.  All of this is streamed only to FB Live and recorded on machine.  On the MBP, this all worked fine, but the battery couldn't keep up, even plugged in.  Had the same issue on my 2018 MBP 13".  But the M1 does all of this without any issues from a power perspective.  Plus, it's much more stable for this use than the MBP.  I would get a lot of sticking video on the MBP and have, so far, received none on the M1.Very happy with the price too.  But, get as much memory and disk space as you can afford.  Can't have too much.
I jumped out of the “Ecosystem” a little while back. Last had a MacBook Pro 13” in about 2015 when we had real ports. I realize those days aren’t coming back and it’s #HubLife or #NoLife. But I’ve been underwhelmed with Apples offerings for a minute.When I started reading up and watching vids on the new M1 I was sold. I’m all in now. This Air is an absolute unit of a machine. I really see no reason for anyone to get the Pro, unless you’re getting the soon to be released updated 16” pro. This bad boy will do all that most people need.Let me say first off, the battery life is phenomenal. I can take it on the go and use it all day with no issues at all. I didn’t even pack my charger with me today. I can carry it in a simple sleeve and I’m good to go. Plus it’s lighter than the pro as well.Performance is spectacular. It runs circles around anything else I have that’s windows based. In testing, I’ve seen it surpass or hold its own, against prior MacBook Pro models. Even those with dedicated graphics.For the majority of people, this is going to be their go to laptop. What you get for an entry level Mac is stellar. This is my recommendation for anyone outside of a hardcore video/photo editor. But even then, in a pinch it will get the job done.
Great product from Apple as usual
Work perfectly, worth money no cracks or anything wrong came perfect packaged
I needed a new computer desperately, (screen broke and volume malfunctioned on my beloved old Asus transformer), so after much research about Macs online, I ordered a new MacBook Air. Most of the online reviews and info praised it except for the camera, and in this current pandemic Zoom world, that was a must!  However, I couldn't imagine a new apple  computer having a worse camera than my old iPhone 6 which I am still happily using, so I took a chance! The laptop is awesome on so many levels! New M1 chip, super fast everything, and fantastic color display!The sound and yes, the camera, are phenomenal! I can only assume the bad camera reviews were made by video bloggers that need extreme HD resolution. I just do average work on my computer, so no problem there! I am thoroughly enjoying surfing online, streaming videos, and Zooming with great clarity. I needed to clarify this camera issue for those holding back from purchasing such a great computer just due to those negative camera opinions, as I was. If I had read my review or one similar to it, it would have eased my mind. So, unless you're a vlogger , fear not!It's a fantastic computer in every sense of the word! (Not to mention the $999 price for a new Mac!) Get it!!! You won't regret it! The rose gold is especially pretty!
I love this laptop. It's fast, practical, sleek, portable, and very useful for me as a college student who does remote work. I have never had a problem with it and I have been using it for a few months now. 100/10.
Good for what it's worth.I'm not a fan of the price, but guess it's just another Apple thing.Great laptop for daily use.The key keyboard is great. I'm not a professional on computers so I'll usually have to look at the keyboard while I type, but not on this one the keys are positioned perfectly.Nice and crisp resolution.Pretty fast.All around great daily use laptop.
ProsWorksNo fan - super quietScreen resolution decent and looks good from most anglessuper-fast response time during usewakes up from sleep instantlylooks nice (for a laptop)not super heavyIf you check your email, listen to Spotify, shop online (Amazon), web browse, watch Youtube videos, Zoom calls, work with Apple Photos, look at PDF's, Use Google Docs/spreadsheets - this is a great laptopConsSome software is not compatible or has problems with the M1 Apple CPU ( not that I've experienced but this might impact you)No Built-in cam cover for $1000+ laptop - and according to apple if you use your own you can damage your screen - https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211148When you open the laptop unless you're super careful you smudge the laptop camera/that general area - that or you open it from the sidesno LED light indicator for if the laptop is on, sleep mode, charging, fully chargedcharging seems kinda slowthey removed the keyboard brightness physical buttons - but you can pin this in the top-right menu bar or and it's in the control centerside note OSOn the login screen of Big Sur, you can see the battery icon but not the exact percentage you have left - have to log in for thatstill have to manually turn on "show thousand separators" on the calculator app
Beautiful computer, light weight,  sophisticated, very smart, great for school!!!!
It's a good laptop. It's an Apple so it is overpriced but you have to expect that buying any Apple product
I was hasitating to buy used, but it was like new. No scratch, no dent, even battery charging cycle was 2. Came with box, original charger, USB-C cable. I am happy with it.
First off: this computer is extremely lightweight, well built, and beautiful. Yes this is the new MacBook Air M1. And it arrived with 4 days after shipping (bad weather slowed it down so it arrived late).Battery: I’ve been on my computer for 12 hours today and battery is at 64%. I’ve had it for 3 days. And have only charged it once.  And that was when it arrived while I set up.  The computer is very quiet it and does not get hot. I’ve had several tabs open and applications at once and it didn’t even slow down or run hot.Camera: FaceTime calls are beautiful on here. Facebook messenger, you look a little yellow, but other people look perfect(probably lighting issue)Sound: is amazing, the best I have had on any computer. Crystal clear sound. This computer gets really loudSpeed: this computer is extremely fast.  Internet sites load with a second. As soon as you sign in it’s an instant log on to your screen with no waiting for application to load.This by far the best computer I’ve had. If you are looking at your first MacBook laptop this is great(this is my first also). If you are looking to upgrade a really old MacBook model you will love this. Worth the money!
Not much to say, excellent product overall. No cons except lack of ports. All day+ battery life, excellent screen. Keyboard is good as well. I have the 8 gb ram version but haven't seen any lag due to it. Use it often to run demanding simulations and it has not disappointed me so far.I was little concerned with the M1 chip and compatibility. However, x86-64 runs well enough, though CPU/ram usage is a bit higher (dropbox, for example). If you are using native versions, its far better than any x86-64 mobile cpus on market.
This is my second time purchasing an Apple Computer. They last a really long time. I got this one for my business.
This product is not cheap, it's not something that you normally could just drop loads of money on... good job if you can.Take students perspective. Not much to my name and obviously in desperate need of something that can at least operate. Sure you can opt for something cheaper if you want something that just "works", however, if you want something that can get the job done, is reliable, absolutely beautiful, and long lasting that can beat any other laptop out of the park with the M1 processor... I'd suggest you get this laptop now.Stop thinking about it honestly, just do it. Two days ago I was sitting here debating for so long if I should even go for it finally somehow having the funds. Regretting doing so even after placing my order. All that went away when I held this near magical product in my hands for the first time. You will never have to buy another laptop again for a long time if you simply take care of it. It's going to take me a long way into my education... as will it you and what you chose to use it for.Happy M1'ing be productive!
This laptop is perfect for student for collage. It is extremely fast however the restarting of this laptop isn’t that fast which is kind strange. Overall I find no faults with this device, I have the 8gb ram version and it performs like a champ for all my needs as a student. I totally recommend this device.
Wish build in a word processor.
Very nice product. Brand new right out of the box
So forget about all the other reviews. This is the skinny from a higher learning teacher: Is it fast? Yes. If you are browsing the web, watching videos, etc. It’s faster than my MSI with 16gb ram and RTX 2060 video card. Is it silent? YES. It’s the whole reason I bought it, so good for me. How is rendering audio or video? Good, BUT…My iMac 5k from 2017 with 4gb of video ram is faster with the few renderings I have done. The following is what surprised me (especially after reading all the fab reviews of battery): I put my Mac Air on sleep mode when I shut it down. Didn’t use it for a couple days, came back to get it and the battery was completely dead. Zero! I was VERY surprised.  I can always leave an MSI, Lenovo, HP, on sleep mode for a week or more. Those are the things I have experienced in my first week. Hope it helps.
I have buyers regret now.  I bought this to update from my old Mac Pro and was hoping I could get some streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc and none of that is available.  I use my laptop for movies and TV while traveling.  No CD drive and none of the aforementioned items make this laptop basically useless to me
I looked at a lot of different laptops and went to my local Best Buy for in person testing before deciding on this one.  I work from home and have been using a older model HP that was passed down to me that had a hour and a half battery life, a plastic shell, and froze endlessly.This laptop is real clean looking, feels solid, has insane battery life, and the screen is absolutely insane.  Watching videos on it is unreal and have had no issues running multiple programs/desktops/and some gaming on it.  I purchased the base model and run it with an external hard drive to keep the space clear on it.I love how all the apple products interact seamlessly with each other and the sidecar feature that links it to the iPad to work as a second screen on the go.In the future would be nice to see the bezels slimmed down, the keyboard have a little more weight to it, MacBook Air speakers amped up a bit, and a higher quality camera and all those things are near perfect.  Ill be holding on to this for the next 5 years plus
It’s a good laptop with all around features and heavy build quality. Missing some of the pro features but otherwise it works great
I hate laptops, until I bought this one anyway. I probably burned through over a dozen  or so over the past decade. One of them was actually another Mac Air. I wasn’t impressed. This 2020 model however provides all the power and versatility that I’ve only previously dreamed about.  The Retina display is gorgeous, clear and easy to read. This PC runs Photoshop faster and cleaner than desktops that cost me $3000 or more. Music played back on this little laptop sounds better than any other I’ve heard.  The new Apple M1 chip really shines, beating the Intel versions of this laptop hands down.
I replaced on older 2009 MacBook Pro with this new model from Apple. It has the new M1 chip and it is fast. For the type of things I do in a home office this is lightning fast. I don't do a lot of editing of videos or play video games on it so my work load is pretty mundane compared to others. I like it though because it is lightweight when I take it to my den or on a trip in my computer bag. The battery lasts a long time and the keyboard is very responsive. Love the screen clarity. I have not found any of my regular apps having any difficulty running on the new chip. I did set up a new camera connection app to see how it would do and had no issues either. It is running in the background and when they update to work specifically with the new chip it should work even better. I don't have any negatives with this computer. I have been an Apple fan for several years now and so use to it that I have great difficulty when trying to use a Window's based computer.
I had previously purchased a “renewed” MacBook Air and it wasn’t exactly what I would call renewed. I returned it and found a new MacBook Air for under $900. Only a few hundred more than someone else’s old one and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve had iPhones since 3GS and they have always been user friendly and the MacBook Air is just like my iPhone but better.I have always had windows and the last one installed the manufacturer update and afterwards I could not log into the computer. That’s the end of windows and the beginning of my Mac attack.I highly recommend this item especially if you are able to purchase it for under $900.
I jumped from a 2010 model MacBook to thisI got the 256 fb 8gb model I produce music and honestly it’s been able to handle all of my plug ins and sound packs with ease...the touch buttons for the sound and brightness buttons are a much better practical way to go then the Touch Bar On the Mac Pro screen quality is solid and it’s really fast and smoothIf you have any doubts for buying this over the pro don’t doubt it...it’s extremely quiet and to be honest one music session I had was about 5 hours straight and the laptop was barely a little warm after all of that editing and recording on Logic Pro x....if you can afford it....it’s worth it....the only thing I think that I’m annoyed with it the fact that apple is still using a 720p webcam....it feels really lazy to me that I’m 2021 they chose to go with a 720p I think if they fixed that the laptop would be perfect
I have had my new MacAir not quite two weeks and it is even better than I expected.  This one is with the new M1 chip and is an upgrade from my previous Mac....which I loved.  Faster, better, more battery.  What's not to like.  And frankly the price for the machine is a bargain.  I do not use my Mac for gaming, heavy downloads, large graphics so can't comment but is why the Air is a perfect choice over the Pro.  Transferring files etc from my previous Mac was a snap and now I have my "old" Mac on the M1 so everything works better.  I was a bit surprised everything is the same size and weight....but that's likely because I didn't look at those specs before purchase.  One sweet thing about the Mac is it comes about 70% charged so just open and start.  If you are considering a Mac or have one and are thinking about upgrade just do it.  And Amazon made it easy....arrived in two days.
Buying into the Apple ecosystem should only be done to make products for the ecosystem which will make the user money, but, do not make them a critical part of your workflow.  They are too expensive for that.  Apple just does not make good computers.  Yes, they make a OK operating system, but they make computers that cannot be repaired by taking out the ssd or ram sticks and putting new ones in.You can't just go and buy the parts to fix your Mac computers when they break.  The MacBook Air is no exception to this.  The SSD is solider to the motherboard.  Likewise the RAM.  Now, if that were the only problem, well -- one would be able to get someone skilled to replace these broken pieces after Apple stop warranty coverage -- maybe.  But, they don't even allow the suppliers of these chips to supply them to the public.  So, once the warranty is. up -- you will not be able to get spare parts for the computer.  Needless to say, this is a major flaw in Apple products -- of which it is no exception for this MacBook Air.  (Oh, and if they start allowing suppliers to supply, but, lock down with crypto keys to a particular machine we just have even more e-waste.)Also, this computer flickers with a 4K output.  The MacBook Air has screen flicker with an external monitor using the HooToo dock that I've used with an Intel MacBook Pro which is a few years old.  This is unacceptable.  Apple's response to the sometimes frying the computer for using USB-C docks that work with other computers is an example of the poorly built computer they are pushing.Though poorly engineered in terms of video, ssd, and RAM.  It is a wonderful typing experience when using the laptop keyboard.  If you are willing to let that guide you, then, the computer may be worth it if you are willing to set aside another grand when ssd fails or you plug in the wrong dock to drive an external monitor even though someone else just had their Intel Mac plugged in and worked just fine.  (Supposedly Apple fix this with an OS update -- good for them.)Even though I dislike the Mac, it is better than most laptops -- because it is quiet since it has no fan.  Would I buy one again? Perhaps -- it is a question of whether I think the market exists for me to make money off of it.The good things:Keyboard, touchpad, Built-In Screen, Build-In Speakers, Drives External Audio better than Microsoft Windows, and the Operating System is less cluttered than is Windows.  Also, comes with a Spreadsheet, Word Processor, Presentation Program -- now, it is better just to use something really Libre -- like LibreOffice.  But, it is kind of nice the table steaks are included -- unlike for Microsoft Windows.
I wanted a new MacBook since it's been several years since I got my last Mac and the battery was going bad.With a delicious gold color and an overall thin, sleek design, this computer is for those who want their computer to look a bit more "fancy" than other options on the market.With the M1 chip, everything is extremely fast. I was able to set up this new machine with 10 minutes.I am not sure if I would recommend this machine to those who have recently upgraded to a Mac (2017 to now) but if it's been several years and you want to splurge, go for this.As a writer, the keyboard is so smooth and I feel like I can type more words per minute on this machine.My only complaint is the webcam, while better, is still not up to par to other computer cameras on the market. FaceTime looks a bit grainy still and Photo Booth is just a joke. The quality barely looks different than recent models.Overall, this is a great addition to the Mac family. I look forward to see how Apple utilizes the M1 chip in the future.83/100
Love it
As much as I enjoy my new MacBook. It is way too soon to be experiencing loading delays. I barely have anything loaded on the computer and I have experienced several delays.
The only issue I have is when watching Apple TV. The sound quality Isaac under heavy bass
every older generation is practically the same, if you are interested in getting any mac the macbook air late 2015 model will fit all your needs and if cleaned properly will work like new. all airs can last extremely long. good quality laptop M1 chip is very powerful but 90% of users wont be able to use this mac to its full capacity honestly. But if you looking for an upgrade this is it, beautiful look, sleek design, light, powerful. will last from freshman year of college to well in post grad career. i say every mac with proper care can last a good 5-6 years then should be handed down to a friend. I gave my last mac book air (2015) away when I got this and my friends says the best laptop they ever had. again only mac worth buying new if you already own one and want to upgrade, 90% of those who will use it wont need the power and capacity it comes with.
Decided to switch from Windows and PC laptops to Apple MacBook and never turning back. Quality hardware and software and looking forward to many years of happy use. I can recommend this product.
Great battery charge length – I haven't tested it such that I could report numbers, but clearly much much better than my previous 2018 Powerbook.Screen very good.The M1 processor is fast, but as expected didn't work on a few peripheral (for me) software types. However, these include iDVD and Microsoft messenger. But then again there may be upgrades available that I feel no compelling reason to pursue.
I can move it and use it everywhere.
This is my first Mac. It was not hard to get used to it as the laptop itself works great and has all the features needed. The battery life is extreme. Way longer than I expected. it also charges real quick. Nice that it uses a USB C plug to charge, it can be plugged in at any USB C plug. The only thing is that it only has two USB C ports. No SD or micro SD reader. I used an external Seagate hard drive with my windows laptop and now use it with the mac, just had to download free software from Seagate. The hard drive has 2 USB A ports that I can use to connect some of my devices that don't have a USB C plug. But this MacBook Air is super cool. The camera and microphone have great picture and sound quality. I have not even had a need to use my external Blue mic yet.
I appreciate that the price was discounted for a great value.  The package was secure and well-packaged, which was very important, given that this was delivered via mail.  No cracks on the screen.  The processing speed is quick, which is extremely helpful!  I appreciate there were instructions, in a small pamphlet, that explained how to transfer everything from your previous MacBook to this MacBook.  A seamless transition is vital and means less frustration.  This MacBook Air is very user friendly, especially visually.  As someone who wears glasses, I appreciate the option to make the pointer larger, the ability to have more contrast, etc...  That the user manual automatically pops up and walks you through enhancements and new features makes this even more user-friendly.
But, I love this laptop.  After asking multiple people who have purchased the same (or better) models and I couldn't be happier purchasing even the lowest end model of MacBook Air.  Does everything I would expect an Apple Computer to do (for what I need it for, basic photo editing, viewing, and typing). So far it's been an amazing purchase.  Just for the sake of keeping Apple on their toes I rated the Battery Life 4 stars and the camera quality 4 stars, as well as the 4 star overall review.  Keep it up Apple, as long as you continue to make the products user-friendly I'll remain a happy customer for years to come.
Super duper awesome
Caveats: This is a Mac, so like any other, software choice can be limited. It's also the new ARM/M1 chip, so certain programs haven't caught up (as of early 2021), especially virtualization (VMWare, VirtualBox) and languages (Haskell).  This is a 13-inch screen, so screen real estate is limited, I couldn't recommend this as a "daily driver", except maybe for school/university.  Probably a great option if you're frequently on Google Meet or Zoom.Overall: amazing battery life; unmatched 3D power for the size & price; gorgeous screen with no color/brightness lost when tilted nor LCD configuration needed to optimize color, white/black levels; Mac OS Big Sur is constantly fast and responsive with smooth animation regardless of what is open/running.I've bought a lot of laptops, but this one surprisingly nice.  If you have to have Windows, or have to stay $1000, get a Microsoft Surface (great too), but if you need a Mac or can afford the splurge, absolutely get this Air M1.
Smaller form than the Macbook Air it replaced but screen size was the same. Lighter, too! The rose gold is beautiful and the computer works incredibly well and is lightning fast. Migration assistant made data transfer from old to new a piece of cake. Absolutely love it!
There’s nothing I don’t like and I’m sure I have not explored everything in my new Air. pro, the screen quality is great, I do not have touch screen and I do not play games on the Computer only on my IPhone.To make along story short, it’s great.
I'm not really a mac user, but I heard a lot of good stuffs on YouTube about M1 Macbook air and want to give it a try. Guess what. I don't think any Windows laptop around this price range can beat this M1 Macbook air. No fan, so it is quiet yet there is almost no heat. Battery life is insanely good. If you are looking for everyday laptop around 900-1000 bucks, this is it. Highly recommended. However, if you play games alot (especially Windows games), then this is a no go.
I used HP laptops for years, their average screen size is like 17, up to almost 20 inch screen size. For this 13 inch MacBook, at first I was surprised, but the second I set things up I got real excited. Siri is super helpful, Mac is small, very easy to carry, super convenient. One thing I like the most is the Touch ID to open laptop. After using Mac I've decided to purchase the latest iPad, Apple products actually worth the money!
Best price-quality MacBook in the history of Apple.
This Macbook was good until the screen started to glitch on the bottom and left side of the display. Apple said the screen didn't have damage, but needs to be replaced. It's 14 months old, outside of the one year warranty, and a new display costs $428. I will not be buying another Macbook in the future.
I gave this purchase a run around and delayed purchasing it for a good while, but I cant stress enough how amazing this computer has been. I take it around with me for studying and playing music and just basic stuff but is amazing, the m1 chip is quite a game changer.
it is fast and the right side for my purse
Work and play
The camera is not really current. Especially for a laptop in this price range. It’s not much, if any, better than the toshiba laptop I got at Walmart for $400 back in like 2010. It is actually fine for me because I don’t rely on it for work or anything. But if you rely on it for virtual meetings, FaceTime, zoom, etc, you will be disappointed in the camera quality. I have very little need for the camera so it doesn’t bother me personally. But the camera is absolutely embarrassing for what has been named the laptop of the year by many, and I would agree, it’s a great computer. Great battery life, super fast charging, very light, not quiet—silent. Quiet implies there is a minimal amount of noise. There is no fan in this and it’s is literally silent. No noise at all, at any level that I can discern. Really fast. Best laptop I’ve ever had for sure.
This laptop is really fast and the battery lasts really long.The battery lasts me about a week with just one charge and I find that crazy.There is not fan noise and this doesn't get hot.The quality is really good.. I mean the way the laptop opens with one hand and the smooth closing of the lid is really smooth.The screen isn't the best but its still really good.This laptop has the M1 chip, fastest chip on the market.This laptop's bench marks are off the roof.It's great for casual use like, watching movies, using word docs and excel sheet, coding and video editing.I wouldn't recommend gaming even though basic games will do just fine.
This Macbook is definitely great for users who want lots of power and versatility, but don't want to break the bank. It is very lightweight and sleek.The color (gold) is also very pretty, but keep in mind that it is more of a pinkish gold than a yellow gold. However, the camera quality is not great for such an otherwise powerful laptop. Especially in this era of zooming and FaceTiming, a good camera is essential in a laptop. It's not terrible, but its not great either. Another thing - the front lid of the MacBook got a couple of scratches very easily. I was able to get them off, but I would suggest getting a good quality case to ensure that this doesn't happen. All in all I would rate this Macbook a 4.5/5! Definitely lived up to the hype!
The display is wonderful. Touchpad is very responsive. I love the size and weight. Very easy to use anywhere
Love apple, but wish it was easier to adapt and find thing after using windows for so long. I have to search in safari for answers. Once, I figure out everything I will be much happier because it is so much faster.
I needed a new computer and this one is just right for me. Very easy to set up and user friendly. I don't know a lot about computers but my sons said I made a good choice with this one. The rose gold is a fun color and a change from drab gray or silver.
Likes:- Great performance despite seemingly underpowered on paper.- Battery life is outstandingDislikes:- There were repeated Safari crashes for first few weeks (since cleared up)- MagSafe plug is gone, though it's nice to have standard USB-C power.- Expensive storage upgrades- A lot of software is still unoptimized for new M1 hardware, but performance is generally acceptable even so- CapsLock delay continues to annoy the hell out of meOther:- Keyboard is fine (upgrading from a 2014 MacBook Pro keyboard, which was solid)- Good for lightweight software development
A plus quality as expected however no port outlets for other services
Like the updated M1 processor.  Like the extra memory.  Don't like the "Left outs".  No lighted apple logo on the cover.  It was replaced by a mirror like decal. (Cheap)  Don't like the lack of ports.  No HCMI, no SDHC memory slot for you camera memory chip, you need to buy adaptor for USBC and there are only 2 on the left none on the right only a 3.5 mm audio jack. In addition when charging the unit there is no indication, no light no sound, nothing that lets you know it is charging.Cheap, cheap cheap....shame on you Apple.
This is my 4th Mac laptop, the earlier ones were all MacBook Pros.  I was reticent about getting an Air, but with the M1 chip, this thing is a superb replacement.  So small & light, yet speedy.  Only drawback is the fixed 8GB RAM complement.  I take care not to send the thing into swap- suspending old browser tabs is essential.
I left the Apple product line years ago due to their practice of "forced obsolesce" with early iPhone models. Having worked in IT for most of my career I like being able to have full control of my device. Apple mostly locks up their devices.But, I decided to give the MacBook Air 2020 a chance because: 1. my MS Surface didn't last long enough for the money and it, too, is hardware locked and 2. I was impressed with the M1 specification.After playing with this machine I have to say the M1 is AWESOME! The screen response is shockingly quick in comparison to other PCs and Apple devices.I highly recommend ONLY buying an Apple device WITH a M1 processor.
Lightweight, blazing fast, easy to use, battery life is incredible with the new Apple M1 chip.  A typical Great Apple product.However, there is only a Thunderbolt port, so you now have to go out and buy a cable to convert USB to thunderbolt (if you want to use a backup hard drive) or other USB items, AND, I had to buy yet another cable to sync my phone's lightning port to the thunderbolt port on the computer. Total $56.I LOVE Apple product, and worked for them in my caerer, but I would wait on buying this version until the software for it has been developed.UPDATE: After several months of using this computer, I have have found several things of concern:1.  my notification center keeps disappearing, despite my constant reinstalling the widgets.2.  my computer's calendar, reminders, and photo stream do not sync with my IOS devices (iPhone & iPad).  If I add an item to calendar on my phone, it will appear on my mac but not vice versa.  Reminders will not sync regardless of which device I originate the item on.I have contacted Apple support on all these issues and they cannot solve the problem.IT APPEARS THAT THE BUGS HAVE NOT BEEN WORKED OUT, YET.  THINGS ARE MADDENINGLY CLUNKY!
The MacBook Air is as advertised. Fast and easy to use with a long battery life. Too few ports for my taste, and the keyboard is only OK. I use a Logitech mouse via Bluetooth, and it is responsive. One positive surprise is that the speakers in the laptop are better than those I've used in bigger machines.
The computer is everything I thought it would be. Gave the camera a 3 star because quality could be better but I don’t use FaceTime as much so it’s not a big deal to me. Overall so worth the money. Great investment for my book writing and finances.Definitely a major upgrade from my HP.Now I wasn’t sure who to contact about delivery or where to write it but I don’t appreciate having told them I want someone to sign for it being it is a high value priced item and it was just thrown on my porch and I wasn’t notified at all then when I go look it says it was directly handed to me. Don’t like liars so Amazon you need to get it together because if this would have gotten stolen I would have raised hell for my money back.-thanks.
Hey it’s an Apple product so it’s made well and is quality!
Excellent battery, speedy, lightweight. You do not often come across these three benefits together. This is still a great purchase if you (like me) do the regular zoom meetings, graphic design, edit 4k video, some spreadsheet work and occasionally edit batches of 100 photos in raw format in Lightroom. Go spend some more in a M1 Pro or Max if you really need that much computational power for 3d or heavy 8k video editing.
I purchased the MacBook Air to replace a 4th Gen Surface Pro that was down to about 30 minutes of battery life.  I purchased an Intel Mac Mini about six months ago and was intrigued by recent news articles regarding the M1 chip.  I'm thrilled with the added battery life on the new device and amazed by the speed difference between my Intel-based mini vs. the M1.  Out of the box, adding a full charge, the new Mac estimates 19+ hours of battery life.  I've been using the computer for three hours, four open apps, and have bumped the battery gauge to 98%.  Think I've eliminated battery anxiety.  App launches are two to three times faster on the Air vs. my Mini.  The new laptop is zippy!  I'm thrilled with my new laptop and look forward to many years together.
I got this for school after my hp computer's battery stopped working. It's really great for the price! the screen resolution is really nice and the touch id is a good add on. I really wish apple would make touch screen macbooks but they probably never will. it also doesn't have a usb port which is kind of weird. learning the controls takes some time but overall a great computer!
I love this computer. It is very light and easy to travel with. It is not air cooled so not hot bottom or the noise of a fan cooling system. Was super easy to set up.
I had a 2008 MacBook Pro that I used until 2014. I then switched back to a PC until purchasing this M1 MacBook a month ago. I don’t know why I haven’t been using a Mac sooner. Having messages and FaceTime and synced with my phone, along with MS office functionality makes this computer a dream to use.Only issue I had was using a usb c to display port plug to plug into my monitor. Worked great until the latest update of Big Sur. Have an open case with Apple and they seem perplexed, but a quick review of reddit shows this seems to be an issue with the M1 chip. I ended up purchasing a usb-c to hdmi adapter and have had no further issues, except being out $15 for the first cable.
Like any laptop this laptop has its little quirks but overall this is one of the best laptops to purchase. I don't know if this is touchscreen but its not that big of a deal for a person like me . The picture/ video quality is great to look at and is very clear but the Photo Booth camera kinda sucks which is a little disappointing . Other than these little things the laptop is  pretty fast and  has all the essential app to create .
Amazing system but run into issue so had to return the product.
FASTEST PERFORMANCE , LONG BATTERY LIFE, LIGHTWEIGHT,COMPACT, GREAT SECURITY FEATURES, TOO MANY THINGS TO LIST BUT THEN IT IS AN APPLE!
This purchase for me was an upgrade from a old MacBook Pro I’ve been using for over 4 years got a refurbished MacBook Pro 2012 for Christmas 4 years ago so I when I saw the 2020 MacBook Air new not refurbished for 899 bucks I jumped on it and I’m glad I did because it’s a great MacBook fast efficient I edit videos for YouTube everyday and this MacBook does it way faster than my old slow MacBook Pro so I’m very happy a must buy for sure
Such a high quality and well-built piece of computing equipment. The M1 processor is a huge leap forward.
I’ve owned Mac’s for over 25 years and this is the worst I’ve ever owned. First off, the mouse buttons are a new horrible design that often do not recognize mouse clicks. Clicking this mouse is the worst experience I’ve ever had on any computer before. My previous 2018 Mac was much better in so many ways.Also i hate that this new Mac only has 2 ports both being USB-c. One is used to charge which means you only have a single USB-c port for use. Another huge downgrade.Also this Mac has the fancy new fingerprint scanner unlock and yet it forces me to re-enter my password constantly. So what is the point of a fingerprint scanner if i still need to re-enter my password 80% of the time?The keyboard also feels cheap and is very uncomfortable to use, another downgrade from my 2018 Mac. Literally this thing feels like a massive downgrade in nearly every way.
Best laptop i’ve ever owned 🫶🏼
Had mine since April and I gotta tell you, I’m literally lost for words. I won’t make this length cause I don’t have to, all you need to know is that this is a must have for anyone wanting to get productivity and entertainment out of a laptop.
I absolutely love this laptop. I'm a software engineer and as you can imagine I spend a lot of time of the computer. This computer is lightning fast, a dream to type on, and it has a beautiful screen. The only downside is that camera quality, which is absolutely atrocious. I have a desktop PC that I do my web conferencing over anyways, so it's not big deal for me. If you really care about the webcam, I would suggest purchasing a third-party webcam. Other than that, I highly recommend this product and I could not be more pleased with it.
I love this MacBook! The battery life is amazing and I have been able to complete work tasks easily. I love the size because I can carry the MacBook when I travel without having to use a big laptop bag. The screen quality is great, but I had a little difficulty seeing the screen outside in a sunny area. Although, when I found some shade I had no problems at all. I am not outside much in the sun on the MacBook so this isn’t a big deal for me. Overall, great product in my opinion. It is perfect for what I need to do for work.
Amazed that it uploaded all my files and I for from cloud. Just turned it on and it worked, syncing with phones and iPad 👏👏👏👏
Quality of item was state-of-the-art. Delivery was exceptional. Elegant packaging. Seller is first-rate and choice.
Amazon had the best price at the time. Great machine. The keyboard is sublime. There are plenty of online reviews on websites and YouTube. This machine truly hits the sweet spot.
I ordered the Macbook to use for my model railroad.  I now use it as my portable computer.  it is small and powerful........
Wonderrful upgrade, easy to migrate and Amazon delivered as promised.
My husband bought me one for Christmas 2020 and my son loved it so we bought him one for Christmas 2021. Great laptop, great price for MacBook. Only thing is I wish it was a touch screen. Love it!!!
Top quality computer
The MacBook Air is an amazing machine! I absolutely love it!!! I only wish that it had more ports on it. Not a huge deal because I bought a hub for more ports, but would have been nice to see more ports on this thing. Other than that, I love how responsive it is, and I love the picture quality! Also, the battery life on this thing is unreal!!! I have left it off the charger for well over a week and have not needed to charge it. It is amazing!!!
it works really well! the screen quality is very good and clear. I’ve been doing schoolwork on mine and it allows me to do things my other computer will not. overall a very beautiful laptop and great purchase! would recommend!!
Personal use - replaces my previous MacBook Air.Great improvements to a classic.
Honestly all I know is that my daughter loves it and thats all that matters to me!
I’m a college student and bought this right before my semester started and it is my most favorite thing!! I was kind of hesitant it would be fake but it really is the real deal and I love my MacBook Air!
found it complicated and deprecated quickly.  The purchase price for me was 1000 saw it at 90 less 2 months later now it's almost $200 less.  Don't feel too good about this,
First Mac laptop I’ve owned and I’m very impressed! Display colors are incredible. Processing speed with the M1 chip is amazing. Super long battery life and light weight. So much packed in a thin design!
In general I love this MacBook Air. I have had other Apple products but this is my first laptop.  It has a great display, it opens easily with touch (fingerprint) ID, you can move easily from here to there and not lose any information. It is great for most purposes. The things I have had trouble with are the Apple word processing, spreadsheet or presentation programs, so I continue to use Office 365. That is not totally fair in this review as the device is wonderful!
This laptop actually lives up to all the hype about the M1 chip and such. It is lightning fast, smooth, clear easy to read screen  and the battery lasts and lasts for all day and then some. Also I have noticed that with any normal use it doesn't even get warm so the lack of a fan is not a detriment but nice as a nonexistent fan can't make any noise. I was slightly skeptical but as a multiple APPLE owner not surprised I was happy. Seriously I just sent a 3 year old iPad that had been used hard daily for a battery replacement and received a brand new iPad 3 days after I sent it in. Thats service as well.
beautiful laptop, powerfull, slim. not like their phones lol.
Great value and device my youngest daughter loves it.
Completely closed and never used. Excellent but excellent laptop. Great investment
Just like the picture ♥️
Needed a laptop with more capabilities for school and it fits the bill I haven’t had no issues with it and it works great and fast.
I absolutely love this laptop. it gets the job done for what I need it for for work. I ran into one issue where I shut it down to charge for some time and then when I tried to restart it it was just a black screen with the arrow on the screen and I had to do a hard restart on it. it has only done that once since I got this but so far I do love it. I have and apple iPhone, iPad, and an Apple Watch and it was very easy to get all systems on the same page.
This thin laptop is attractive and works efficiently.  Great graphics.
I am glad it finally came, took longer then advertised for shipping. Came with everything as advertised. No broken seals.
I bought what I considered to be a “Rose Gold” MacBook and it’s absolutely beautiful. It works just as well. I’m just Mac’ing away with course studies as well as my business. Now I can work at home or take it with me wherever I go. It’s light weight and the resolution is amazing. So much better than the laptop I was using.
Love this computer !
Love this computer! I am a PC user switching to Mac for the first time! The computer comes in perfect condition and extra boxes for additional protection.It also arrived so quickly even when it was Black Friday. Thanks Amazon!
Can't add much that hasn't already been said. I upgraded from a 2017 MacBook Air and find this to be superior in just about every way. The battery life is at least twice what the 2017 was, the screen is much better, the keyboard is better, the overall size of the computer is smaller and I love the larger haptic feedback touchpad. I don't use the camera but it isn't the greatest from what I understand and I do kind of miss the magsafe connector.
It’s an Apple. That really says it all.
I use this product for work.
Pros. I Love the new M1 processor, I had an i5 MacBook air before this one that was fast, this one is to me compares to the i9 for speed.Cons, I don't like that you have to buy an adapter to have a USB or to use my camera SD card, plus they took away the magnetic cord you charge with now it is just a plug-in like the Macbook Pro. Being a Computer tech I see problems in the future with it being a plug, they always seem to loosen up as the years go on. Other than that I LOVE IT!
It was a very nice laptop! Loved the color. The specs was great. I am not very comfortable or familiar with Apple products. Returned for a refund and bought a Windows laptop. Really wanted to keep it but had a hard time figuring out how to use it.
Very fast. Should come with a converter for USB.
Great computer… came packaged very nicely. Good purchase.
Best laptop you can buy but mine came scratched idk why Apple is trying to punish me for but it's fine. Also be really careful because the screen is special, it has a coating for retina display and even touching it or gently cleaning it can remove some of the coating and leave subtle blue marks. Sound is boxy I'd recommend SpeakerAmp and choose flat sound to get a clearer sound. But nothing is perfect of course and for that price this is a great investment
I am not a computer nerd, I use my computer to finish charts from work when I am at home or to just browse the web so the MacBook Air was all I needed. I love the screen, the keyboard, size, and weight.
This MBA is fan-TAS-tic to use. It can run unplugged all day. The speaker is sufficiently loud, and the hi-rez screen is eye-popping.But using a Mac laptop's USB-C port for power, after more than a decade of Mag-Safe bliss, is darn-near CRIMINAL. Thankfully, we still have capitalism, and there are a number of 3rd-party workaround devices that mimic Mag-Safe to a greater-or-lesser degree. Sigh.
The only thing I can’t figure out , and I haven’t put much effort into it since I’m in the hospital is how to turn on the touch screen option. I thought it would be automatically on . Other than that I love my new MacBook Air Laptop and would recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop computer
I'm a mac guy and have been purchasing mac products for years.  I was taken back by the camera quality on this product.  It was strange that the 2015 macbook air that I sold before getting this 2020 version had a much better camera.  The camera quality is horrible.  It almost looks like a camera from 2001.  Other than that the product is great, and does what it needs to do.
I love this laptop it’s very light it’s very thin the screen is a great size not too big not too small the battery life is great Mine did not come with the touchscreen but I really don’t have a need for it the keyboard is perfectly fine I highly recommend this laptop I can’t say anything bad about it would buy it again
I upgraded from MBP2018 15" to MBA 2020 , simply too good value, much lighter in weight, but the running speed is actually my old computer is still very smooth too, the screen improvement is obvious
This is my very first MacBook! I’ve been wanting to have one but couldn’t afford it. I was using my Sony laptop since 2004 and it finally broke. I thought, if I was gonna buy a new laptop it should be MacBook so I did save some money for it, but my savings could only afford MacBook Air 2020. I love it! It’s looks cool and I enjoy using it and will probably use until it lasts lol.
Exceeded all expectations.  Amazing entry level Mac.
She use for job
I had a MacBook Pro 13 2015...that machine lasted a long time and I love it. It dropped and I needed a replacement fast. MacBook Air 2020 is not a disappointment. The battery life even if downloading is incredible. I had it downloading all night and I still have a charge. It was only a slow download because the internet speed sucks. The touch ID is a delight. I love the picture quality. So far I am so impressed. Hopefully it will last as much as the other lasted.
It’s perfect and fast shipping
This is a M1 Macbook Air what more can we say?  We went with Used - Good Condition Space Gray in order to save money and so far everything looks and works well.  There were 2 battery cycles, minor signs of use on the bottom, and the charger was obviously used but otherwise its in good shape.  There were about 8 months of factory warranty left and I couldn't add applecare+ since it was bought used so I went with a 3rd party warranbty service instead.
The best laptop for everyday tasks
I was looking for a laptop that was easy to use, light and portable since I live in a apartment with wife and 2 kids there is no space to have a full blown desk so I needed something small and fast and this new MacBook Air is perfect, I love everything about it,  battery life is great but then again I mostly use it for light web browsing and email checking nothing heavy
Battery life is great, once you are not doing to much things. I had a glitch with the mouse the first day I bought it. But I have not seen it again from that day. It is portable, nice slim laptop, not heavy, work well so far. Camera quality is not so good, I think apple could have updated their camera quality, but it is fine anyways, usable. The speakers are loud and nice. Nice sound quality.
I bought this to replace a 2015 MacBook Pro, and it’s worked out great. Better screen and better battery life. Much faster processor. Also much thinner and lighter yet I can use my existing laptop sleeve. Happy with this.
I love my MacBook Air! I chose gold, it’s such a beautiful classy color. It came in original packaging packed very safely. I haven’t tried the camera yet.I switched to iPads since 2010 and haven’t missed crashing windows one bit. I needed to do a few things my iPad wouldn’t do a Mac it was! The battery life is amazing, and the screen brightness is great, I’ve heard it isn’t bright as the MacBook Pro but I can’t believe anything would be brighter! I can’t put the brightness but half way up.
The MacBookAir does not have a touch screen and I don't use it for gaming. It is a great notebook just as it is.
Amazing
No issues with this MacBook, came in perfect condition, very easy to navigate, LOVE the Touch ID, and the camera quality is okay, not as good as a phone. The battery lasts about an entire day, and the charger that comes with it is super high quality. Buttons are very big and easy to see and push, the lighting on them is perfect. The touch pad being bigger is wonderful! Very light and easy to handle, get as much storage as you can afford. Able to do everything I need & more, 100% recommend.
What a great improvement over my old MacBook Pro. This is my third such computer. It keeps me in touch with the world and Amazon. What bugs me is the razzle dazzle passwords I must come up with to access other sites which is why I use Amazon almost exclusively There are so many goodies on this one that I will probably use only a few, though it is made for the new generation of users. Great product. Thanks Applel
Great laptop, feels so premium. Fast enough for common use and the battery mas a lot, I have to charge it every three or four days.
I am not computer savvy, but find this Mac to be easy to use.  I was limping along on a 12 year old MacBook Pro and could not even update to the new OS (Big Sur), so it was time.  I didn't need the big footprint of a MacBook Pro so this is a good fit.  I'm still finding my way around but so far, so good.
I have been a Mac user for a long time and this one is certainly up to standards. Got some great help from Mac setting it up and ended the frustrations of my old one.
After a month of usage, the keyboard does not respond accurately, it repeats different keys and numbers. The delete key sometimes work sometimes it does not. I tried refreshing and it did not work. I had to send it get checked to see what the problem is. I think is hardware. Bad luck! If you can, pay international warranty coverage.
I'm giving this a 5 star because the laptop is perfect for what it is and the seller was great, however I watched multiple YouTube videos glorifying the M1 chip as being fast enough that 8GB could handle a ton of open applications. I need a bunch of tabs open for my work, use Canva constantly, and occasionally need to open Photoshop too so I needed to return this and buy 16GB. But that's my fault and the YouTube reviews faults, not the laptop. Battery life is amaaaazing though!
We own a MacBook Pro but needed a second laptop to keep the marriage from going off the tracks.  Bought the MacBook Air and are very pleased.  It's lighter than our pro, has similar performance, is a bit lighter and cheaper.  The only negative is that its two USBC ports are on one side, makes it trickier to keep it plugged in our seating situation.  Probably not an issue for most.  Oh, the battery life seems better than the Pro.  Definitely recommend it.
It’s a good quality
Get this computer for all intents and purposes! I bought it for IT and database administration and I just wanted a computer who could think for me. This is it. Along with its long computer time and screen life
so my thoughts are on the M1 air version and I must say its a great machine for the price it's my first apple device as I'm a pc gamer but I had to have this because of the ARM chipset being that it surpasses a lot of x86 chipsets it's very impressive the battery life is by far the most impressive thing about it...nothing at the moment beats the battery life it's great it has a great IPS display as well looks very vivid and sharp
I love it. This is my first IOS computer and I’m in love. The quality put into it is top notch. This is my primary computer for school and everyday use. It’s well worth the investment!!
Was given as a Christmas gift.
Ive had this computer for 2 months now, and I still can’t find a single thing to complain about. The battery will last me 12 hours of gaming, something I didn’t think was even possible out of a high-performance laptop. When I say high performance, I mean it. This thing runs Minecraft on 60 fps with fancy graphics and 24 chunks of render distance; and it doesn’t even get hot! This is probably one of the best tech purchases I’ve ever made.
My great grandson uses this for online schooling. Perfect. He is very happy.
I absolutely love love my new lap top! I had a Macbook Air in college and now I have one for working at home and for traveling if the desire arises! The price is great and the quality is excellent, I noticed other reviews commenting on the quality of the video, however I do not see it being grainy at all!
Nowhere was it mentioned that this is the castrated 7 GPU Core version. Feeling deceived. In addition, the 8 GB RAM / 256GB SSD Version is nigh useless for anything beyond websurfing. Having multiple apps open concurrently almost immediately yields the spinning beach ball of death. With a regular set of apps, like the MS Office suite, the disk fills up in no time. Now OS updates are not working, since they require at least 15 GB disk space. But - battery life is out of this world, with the CPU temp sitting at 36C!
Beautiful and looks really nice.  Quality looks like true Apple quality.  Battery life is respectable.  No touch screen but keyboard makes it easy to use
This was my first MAC purchase! the QUALITY, ENGINEERING, CRAFTMANSHIP is TOP notch! Surprisingly NOT HARD to adapt to using coming from a PC! VERY happy.. absolutely LOVE all the VERY helpful features, still discovering NEW ones & FASTER ways to do things on it EVERYDAY. Plus it LOOKS like a million bucks & very nice/addictive feel to the the touch.. can't say ENOUGH GOOD things about MacBook Air.. APPLE - - you've hit a GRAND SLAM with this one & the M1 chip!! thanks.
Excelent.
Upgraded from my 2014 MacbookAir b/c it was slowing down. This 2020 MacbookAir started out great, but within 3 weeks it's slowing down too! Display is more or less fine. Front camera quality seems to have deteriorated somewhat. But trying to open applications, download/upload files, etc . . . is getting slow now and it's annoying.
I have to reset this thing at least 5 times per week in the middle of meetings and such for no reason. I've done all the updates and it's brand new, it just doesn't work. I'm guessing this has to do with the fact that it has an Apple chip instead of an Intel one, and like most things Apple actually makes its glitchy and unreliable. Makes sense that it was on sale. If you have to buy an Apple try to get the ones that have the fewest Apple parts as possible.
Received at the right time to assist with job
Everything that Apple does is top of the line and you can’t do any better.
No complaints so far - in fact, I am actually very impressed! The battery life is incredible (although I have only had it for two days!) and the screen, keyboard, and body are great. I had a Macbook Pro (2012) eons ago and this is obviously far and above that.I was a bit nervous buying from Amazon but I was impatient and couldn't wait the 2+ weeks it was going to take from Apple or Best Buy. It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
Perfect perfect perfect. Nothing damaged and I got it for a good price! 100 dollars off at the time.  Thank you ❤️❤️❤️
It may replace my iPad Pro 11” based on my use so far.
Other then battery life this thing is awesome. No complaints, lightning fast, never had a single problem with anything as of yet. Would like the battery to last more then a few hours but it could also be everything I have running on the computer. Overall I would recommend this to my friends and family
My first Apple product. Great hardware and software. Coming from Windows Lifer, it had been no problem getting upto speed on Big Sur. Got it on promotion too for 850. No brainer.Best laptop purchase I ever made.
Nice computer
This is my first MacBook and I like it for the price, but touchbar isa bit weird. As i find out this is not fault apple just have this kind of touchbars. I had acer predator helios 300 before this and it has much better toucbar. Much comfortable in every aspect.
I'm a PC guy, not a apple fanboy. Credit where is deserved though, Apple does make nice if overpriced devices. It definitely has the best screen of any laptop I've bought. The M1 battery life and performance is quite impressive for a laptop for this size and price. Keyboard is good too. Points deducted for apple pulling it's usual crap.... Only 8 gigs of ram and 256 of storage. Lack of ports too.
Like every Apple product, this is top notch. The original M1 chip is clearly outstanding, the speeds are phenomenal, and the batter life is tremendous. Certainly no complaints here!
My first time MacBook experience, there are many things to learn, my iPhone and iPad  experiences helps, that is the Apple system, its shares so many apps, functionalities, the  M1 chip is amazing, laptop never got warm and I use it for three or four days without charging.I have migrated many window office documents to Mac, am still learning so far I'm impressed with the new Mac air. quality is top notch
Finally got my MacBook Air. So far so good. Value for money. I have used windows all my life. My first MacBook. Will share an update.
Good product. Shipped quickly and arrived earlier than expected.  Highly recommend.
I'm a Windows guy.  I bought this because I am creating a few apps.  The apps aren't ready; so I really haven't used it yet, beyond exploring for a few hours.  It's neither fast, nor large, by today's standards, but it is solid, light, and robust with Apple's latest release.  It'll last for years.No way to connect Apple's top products:  Mac Air and iPhone.  I guess I need more cables.  Please, sir, take more of my money.
Once you own one of this you will never buy the windows crap.
Also I have been a Microsoft user for many many years, I decided to take the leap for a new OS and computer to expand my technology IQ and support for a new OS.I am impress by the small footprint-weight and especially the speed, resolution and ease of use with Mac OS Big Surf functionally. I would encourage anyone wanting to take the same leap- this the computer to start. I have evening carried over some my Windows OS applications- i.e. Office 0365- it works
The configuration is not high, but the running speed is very fast.Convenient for home and office!
It's an apple product, so it always lives up (or even surpasses) the expectation. My daughter loves the color and the size. Now I feel like I need one myself!
First time owning a MacBook, I didn't want to cheap out on a good computer for school so I chose this and it does not fail to deliver. Very responsive and runs smooth when operating, I even don't mind using it without a mouse as it's trackpad is excellent. Crazy how this thing is so quiet. Very happy with the purchase!
I absolutely love it! Bought it because I’m a math major in college and it’s just what I needed! It charges fast and stays charged! I never shut my computer down but put it to sleep and battery is still good! I haven’t used it to it’s max ability so I’m not sure 100% of what it can and can’t do! It’s light and is gorgeous.
Never owned a Mac and now never going back to Windows.  So smooth and fast with phenomenal battery life up to 8+ hours. Great screen as well with backlit keyboard. Easy to transfer files from Windows.  This is money well spent replacing a 5+ years old slow heavy HP laptop!
I never owned a Mac before and I am very pleased with this purchase. I was nervous about ordering it off Amazon at first but it was slightly cheaper and came in exactly two days. No issues with damages or overall quality. Screen quality/graphics are great. I am able to play most of the computer games I wanted to on here with no overheating issues. Battery lasts a while depending on what I am doing and charges very quickly.
My whole experience with ordering a MacBook off of amazon was amazing. It was smooth and easy, and showed up to my front door extremely early. I would venture to say that it was one of my favorite purchases and amazon made it that much easier. I would recommend for anybody to do this same thing.
best seller and good product
Easy to use and fast
This new Mac is more powerful than all previous versions, runs silent (no fans), dissipates heat under the heaviest of loads with no throttling, and does so while lasting 48 hours on a chafe and being almost as light as your phone.People taking about M1 being an issue either don’t know enough to figure it out or are straight lying. Everything works fine.If you’re looking to upgrade, you can’t go wrong with this.
Love it cant wait to use it
Needless to say, I love my Macbook Air. This is the first time I purchased a laptop that's apple. I have owned one in the past, but it felt good actually purchasing my own this time. Now I not only have an Ipad, Apple Watch, Apple phone but I now have an Apple Macbook Air.
I love that this laptop is lightweight and the perfect size. Thought it was going to be much smaller but thankfully it was just right!
Did not like the color. The gold is NOT gold, rather rose gold. So this is a misrepresentation on the color. If you think it will be true gold color, you will be disappointed. It looks and is rose gold has a pink color to the gold.
What’s not to like? It’s a great Apple product! Bought to replace a 2013 MacBook Pro that worked flawlessly right up until it was destroyed in an accident. Setting it up and getting on with my life was pretty seamless, as it has been on every Apple product I’ve ever upgraded. I’m enjoying the increased speed and more up to date features as a bonus — especially longer battery life!
Bought this for my mom, she wanted to use a mouse. I gave her one of my old mouse. Where is the usb port? 20 more dollars for an addon for usb ports!, 720 camera still on a 2020 product come one!Everything else is great. wow, woah
A windows user now with first Mac, very nice, processing video and photographs are excellent. It's light weight and no fan equals no noise!
Saved $100 over the price at the Apple Store. Good deal for an Apple.
Got it for my daughter for school. I asked her after she spent some time with it- how is it? Her response was- I LIKE IT!!! That answers all my questions! That's all I want to know. Apple 🍎👌
Great computer. Arrived quickly!
If you're a heavy user, go for the 16 gig model. The 8 gigs 8s good enough for day to day task, plus the battery is unbelievable.  Easily goes for 2 days without worries
I had a MacBook Pro that is over ten years old and has served me well, but it was time to upgrade. Happy so far, the light weight is awesome, keyboard is excellent and quiet, so far so good!
Great laptop! Nice and easy to work!
This is my first laptop and I’m real happy with the purchase. The speakers on this are nice and loud I love it. The size is a great size, not too big and definitely not too small, it’s just right. The screen is great too love the picture quality and it gets brights. I’m not super in tune with all the laptop lingo and things that matter but as a person who just bought their first laptop, definitely worth it.
Unexpectedly this turned out to be a espectacular laptop. Yes, some applications are still not available natively for the M1 chip but even through emulation they are very fast to use. Camera despite having the same.720p res it has a better image quality and I assume this is due to the chip processing image better than intel. For everyday use this is perfect for other tasks such as programming not yet.
Blazing fast!  This was my first Mac and I was Only familiar with iOS devices so I can compare to past models. But I can say that the MacBooks with the M1 chips our as fast as an iPad when it comes to light duty things.
This is the first Apple computer I've ever had and I adore my Mac. I originally bought it for editing my videos for my YouTube channel (Rae of Sun Asmr) which is still its main function. Now however, I almost prefer watching things like Netflix, etc. on here vs on my actual television. Picture quality on this thing is superior. Highly recommend.
I'm absolutely stunned by this laptop, it's pefect in every way. Super fast with incredible screen quality and the outside color (rose gold) is beautiful!! It's extremely light and can be carried anywhere. I did get a protector because I was afraid to damage it since it's so light I felt like I could add a bit of protection so I put a clear plastic case and it still feels very thin and light.
This is replacing a 11 inch air that I spilled a beer on.  I pretty much love everything about it except the bigger size and heavier weight.  Battery life is amazing.  Speed, still hard to get used to.I loved the smaller size though.

I love my MacBook, battery is so good. Camera isn’t amazing but it’s pretty good, but you have to remember…. This is a laptop. Prefect for zoom!  So as long as your not taking your MacBook on a photo shoot, camera quality is great! Screen is small. But it’s fine! Lighter than a feather!
WINNER WINNER APPLE DINNER...it is a gem...software setup cumbersome but once done...it kicks assTHe trackpad lil stiff on clicking to select...guess breaking in will solve it...Rosetta 2 had to be installed..so it can run intel based apps..if you get pop up ...install it...had me goingBut for the money..it is fast..and installed new update...loads of preinstalled goodies...APPLE got this one right...the webcam they should have splurged on...they couponed out ..but good enough...3rd party apps will fix
M1 processor performs great.  Would rate a 5 if I could run my iPad applications.  Limited apps compared to iPhone and iPad.  Hopefully this will improve.
Best computer i have ever had, very good job Apple. Comparing to many brands HP, Acer, Dell, etc this is a rocket based on price, speed, image, performance, everything. just the best buy you can ever have, dont doubt it for a second.Btw i rarely do reviews for stuff i buy but it deserves it, could not be happier!
Good value,I  use it for music productionJust get a 16Gb memory for a better experience.
Bought this for my daughter and now my wife wants one too!Very thin and light weight.
M1 chip is faster than core i5. I see there is quite a big difference in machine handling concurrent applications at a time. Really nice improvement by Apple.
The battery life in this laptop exceeds everything I've ever seen before. On a full charge after being on standby for a week I still have 90% battery left. In the past I've always been afraid to leave my laptop for any period of time without shutting it down. Now I never shut it down. an occupational reboot after an update or something is all it needs.
Very fast! Starts right up! Only complaint is wish it had the old magnetic power plug and more usb connections. Other then that, fantastic!
Really love my mac, but when it's arrived there is some stink out of it. I guess these Mac's are being kept at a damp warehouse or something.
I have own a apple iPad and now this ,it is everything I could ask for in a laptop.I have own several other laptops made by different manufacturers and everyone failed me! this is far better and very easy to setup I had no problems setting it up at all! very pleased and would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fast and powerful laptop!
This little puppy gets the job done at half the price of the bigger one. Great deal from Amazon.
This has been the best purchase I have made in a very long time. My computer can go days without needed a recharge and has a sheik finish. I have shared this link with many already. The greatest of all is that it last for years!
this item is very good. I buy it for my son who is going to college in Shouth DAKOTA  at MOUNT MARTY university, He is happy and am happy for him.
Powerful laptop that can handle music production and djing softwares without problems. This computer is so light and thin that it is unbelievable how well it works.There is no need to buy a Macbook Pro M1. Shop this one without hesitation.
This MacBook is super fast and convenient to use. Typical Apple quality but yes you will have to pay a price for it.  The M1 chip is amazing and worth it.  Wish the bezels weren't as big but you can't get everything right?  Highly recommend if you are a fan of Apple. Very lightweight and portable.
Great screen, surprisingly amazing speakers, unparalleled speed and battery life.
Love it great price and as advertised
Highy recomended, lightweight, portable, easy to carry
It’s amazing. It has everything I need and more to be able to stay on track from day to day life. It’s by far the best to me out there right now
Came on time and without a scratch. Save money and buy from here
This Mac is the fastest that I have had. Wakeup is instant. The fingerprint reader is exceptional. Screen quality is tops. Connectivity to external devices is simple and easy. Very satisfied
Attractive gold colour that looks like rose gold, lightweight, speedy. Ideal for browsing the internet, reading emails, Microsoft Office. Purchased brand new from the Apple Store on Amazon - "Ship and Sold by Amazon". Received in pristine condition with one year Apple Warranty.
First venture into Mac. Laptop has some heft to it with a nice aluminum chassis. Screen is sharp, very bright and responsive. Keyboard is on par with other laptops I use daily (Lenovo). Blows standard laptops out of the water with battery life.
The m1 MacBook Air is the perfect machine blending the best aspects of cell phone computing with the functionality of a laptop. This means unparalleled performance, amazing battery life, and beautiful screen quality. Along with these improvements the keyboard is also refined and no longer used the dreaded scissor mechanism. The only improvement I could ask for is the webcam.
I absolutely love this MacBook!! It has a finger print scan to unlock it and to fill in passwords which is so handy. The battery life lasts for a long time. The screen quality is flawless. It’s super fast and comes with so many useful apps on it!
Beautiful laptop. I’ve upgraded from the MacBook Air of old...so far this laptop has blown it away. It wasn’t overly pricey to be honest and I feel it’s worth the price. Overall look is great and keyboard feel is nice. Larger touchpad is great, I’ve paired my Magic Trackpad 2 with it as well.
I love, love, love this computer. I just love the fact of having everything in the cloud. When I try to look at some file that I was working on my MacBook from my phone, it will come up quickly and fast. Everything is synced. Love the keyboard, the features, the color and texture of it, will definitely stay with Apple!
I’ve had a 2012 MacBook Pro and it’s still running good just a lil slow. Now to upgrade to this MacBook Air not a big difference but runs way smoother
Was bought as a graduation gift for my daughter. Display quality and sound from the built in speakers is exceptional. She currently  only uses it for Netflix and YouTube until college starts in a few weeks though lol.
I don’t do gaming
Disliked mot knowing there are not many apps made for the Mac book.  Guess that’s why I hung onto my other windows computers
Almost everything is top-notch: Performance, battery life, new magic keyboard, usual unparalleled trackpad, quality of materials and build. I was a little concerned about lower screen brightness of MB Air versus MB Pro prior to purchase, but have no complaints. Only feature less than excellent is camera, which is only 720p. Limited ports only a minor inconvenience. Most highly recommended.
It was a great buy and will HIGHLY RECOMMEND for others.
The item is great, allows me to be productive without worrying about performance being an issue. It was shipped quickly and arrived at my front door just 5 days after purchasing. Highly recommend this laptop for those who don’t need the highest specs but, can get by doing mostly everything you throw at it just fine.
You get what you pay for, and that $1000 I dropped on this MacBook was worth. I went through a few cheap laptops that went from $200-400 bc I needed it for my college classes and then after wasting my time buying and returning them,  I finally decided to go all out and no regrets with this purchase. 10/10
So far this has been a wonderful purchase. The processor is so fast, that’s what I noticed the most is how fast it is. Super excited to get the M1 ship at such a discounted rate.
This might be one of the best MacBooks currently in the market, but it has limited functionality compared to Windows PCs and even certain Chromebook features. The MacBook Air has a beautiful screen but no touchscreen support. It also has an excellent trackpad. However, the MacBook doesn't allow you to perform certain basic features without paying for additional software to access them. For example, you can't snap multiple windows next to each other as you simply would on Windows PCs and Chromebooks.
My child is taking class on this Laptop
The M1 chip is amazing and a miracle, this little chip can play some of the most cpu demand games around cities skylines it played phenomenal without any lag or freezing. This MacBook Air is very powerful. the downside to it, is that it doesn't have a cooling fan and one cooling fan in it would make a major improvement.
This computer is a good buy and works very well. My only complaint is that I have been a pc user all of my life (more than 60 years) and I am having some challenges with the OS. Not their fault. Delivery, packaging, speed, and everything seems really good. I am satisfied.
Everything works amazing. Although choice of camera has very low quality.
It is everything I wanted  in a laptop. It’s easy to use .All you have to do from the box is open the lid and your up and running
This computer lived up to and surpassed my highest expectations. I could not recommend it more. The battery life is surreal. The screen is gorgeous. It is snappy, fast, and outperforms my much more expensive previous gen Macs. Such an incredible feat of engineering.
This is a replacement for my 11 year old MacBook Pro that still works but I’m glad to have this new MacBook Pro Air. It’s battery life is far better that my old one and I am enjoying its much lighter weight. Amazon’s price was the best I could find and with my Prime Chase card I am buying it interest free.
I love this laptop.  I was a die-hard PC / Android person prior but my experience with this product is really pushing me to the Apple world... Also the keyboard rules compared to the old butterfly keyboard they had previously.
Excellent screen quality, user friendly.
Very clear quality screen. Battery is surprisingly long lasting. Safely packaged.
Best ever
This is a very good computer. Very fast and works with most people.... but, some apps just don't work. They used to work in my other Macbook pro. but on this M1 it simple won't work.... apps like Google drive!!!! for good sake!Even worst... trying to return... 15% restocking fee.Serious Amazon?!
I’m a very light computer user, so the quality of everything meets/exceeds my expectations! The screen looks pretty large to be a 13” laptop. Definitely well made
Currently writing this review on the laptop Everything about it is amazing. This could be the best laptop ever made by apple as the m1 chip is mind-blowingly fast. Keyboard and touchpad feel are amazing. Convenience is unmatched with all of the built in features that work seamlessly. For students, there's no better option for this great of a value.
This is the second MacBook I’ve owned. The first one lasted 11 years. Apple makes a quality product. The MacBook Air is lightweight, responsive and excellent graphics. I continue to invest in only Apple products.
Replaced a wonderful 2012 Macbook Pro. Much lighter, faster, clearer, computer. Mac just keeps getting better and better. Such a class act.
As usual I am really impressed with the  product and also the efficiency on handling my purchase.....the United States  post office really should look at Amazon and Apple on how to run a business! ....just saying....
Solid product and a good value.
Everything I expected and more.
Battery life and screen quality
great product, suits me
I love this laptop!
It was time to update a pc laptop and and took the plunge and switch to an apple product. It's a great system and works well with my other apple products ie iPhone/AirPods. I especially like the fingerprint function. Nothing to complain about for this user.
I had an 11-inch Mac Air Book, upgraded to the 13.3 version and I love it; easier to use, still infinitely portable. Smooth and seamless to use. Thanks so much
YOU WILL NEVER REGRET THIS PURCHASE IF YOU ARE A MAC PERSON.  IT IS GOOD FOR PC PERSONS AS LONG AS THEY ARE WILLING TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT, AS IT IS DIFFERENT FROM A PC.  SOME SOFTWARE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND.
First MacBook and I am in love! I have been using my computer for two days and still have 60% battery life. Very impressive because I have been using it a lot. I’m still getting use to the different feel on how to use it but it really is self explanatory once you start using it.
it's a great product, the battery the best of all, I charge it every 2 days with heavy use.
Nothing but the best :) <33It’s so light and cute!
This laptop is better than I expected. I highly recommend this laptop to anyone in the market of purchasing one
I bought this exclusivley for working on music and it excells at that
I only charge it every few days, battery is awesome on it so far. Still getting used to using a Mac after only ever having a windows laptop but so far so good.
Everything is so snappy.Great screen, amazing battery life.Windows users, do not hesitate on getting this. After more than 10 years using windows and in certain years of college Mac OS, this runs like a f1 car.Trust me, if you want to buy a new laptop, this is it.
Love my new Mac !  It’s very light, battery lasts a long time. Days even - with light use.  Charges quickly too.  I haven’t bought a case yet - it’s too gorgeous to cover up!  But will buy a sleeve for transporting when I travel. No complaints.  LOVE IT.
Easy to use and versatile
Have been wanting one for a while great purchase and the m1 chip is well worth it
Light, powerful, and impressive. I'm very happy with the purchase.
I travel alot for work and needed something light but durable . I tried a few laptops but nothing rlly stuck but after this one the search is over!
I was skeptical at first but now I’m convinced!  ARM Is like the cpu in the terminator movies! lol. No fan and battery last all day easily!  It absolutely crushes my 6 core i7 MacBook Pro on Geekbench test!  You will not regret buying one!  Look at the picture and see for yourself!
Love how fast it is.  Also very light and doesn’t get hot.  Does not have chrome and I haven’t used Safari in years, but that’s ok
I’m really happy with this purchase because I’ve wanted a MacBook for a long time and when I finally wanted to save up for it the day I bought it, it went to 899 and I was happy
This computer met all my expectations. Came well packaged and shrink-wrapped and is definitely new and in perfect  condition. I love the color and the screen quality is wonderful.
Returning to Mac after 10 years. And with M1 MacBook Air it's a pleasant experience. Everything working smoothly as expected. Happy to be back!
I love my Mac book Air.  Very easy to use.  I love that everything goes to iPhone, iPad and Mac book and I don't have to do anything.  I have not began to use all of the 100's of features.  Extremely pleased.
I’ve had the same MacBook Pro for 7 years and it was finally time to get a new one. I wasn’t sure about the Air, but I’m so happy I went with it! Not a bad price, shipped very quickly, battery lasts a long time, I just love it.
Only issue I have is the front camera Is not clear, I needed to buy a webcam
Love this lap top but it’s ridiculous that it doesn’t have an usb or hdmi, so if you plan to buy MacBooks then get the adapter too. Otherwise you won’t be able to connect your phone to your laptop.
Enjoying the fingerprint feature of this new MAC air. Loading is quick with the new Apple M1 chip.Wish I could use a mouse instead of touchpad. Did that on prior models over the years.
Bet thing ever
I absolutely love this computer and all of it's features! It was well protected and packaged throughout the shipment, so I didn't have any damage to my new computer when I received it.
Idk why I’d expect for it to be any less than perfect , for the price I paid it just better had been !!! Lol it’s just what I wanted .. I totally forget about my phone because I’m so happy about my new labtop! Lol💞
So I have never bought any Apple laptops off Amazon but it did arrive wrapped and packaged as if it came from Apple itself. Battery life is great, keyboard is great and it’s light. I don’t use laptop cameras so I can’t say either way on how good it is or isn’t.
I deleted a previous review.......good computer.....set-up was complicated and frustrating due to security concerns.  Now it is set up and working great!  It was user confusion that was frustrating.
Simple,  compact. Great fir travel. Not easy to operate and combine w other Apple products from different generation.
I have zero complaints. I’ve always heard wonderful things about Apple computers.  I wish I made this purchase a long time ago. Would have avoided headaches and could have saved myself a lot of money on cheap laptops.
The cámara it’s really good , so I just had my first problem with it I was doing homework and the screen started glitching so let’s see what happen
Nothing to dislike, very good device
First time using an apple laptop. The battery life is unbelievable. Great choice I made on MacBookAir.
I am absolutely in love with my new computer. Still getting used to the commands of a MAC but I love it.
This product is the best purchase I’ve done for laptops. I do accounting and wanted a secure Apple product. It’s fast and sleek and professional.
I use it everyday for my Red Cross volunteer work. Gets tricky switching between my MAC, iPad & iPhone but that’s on me. I wished more apps were compatible over PCs.
This was a value replacement for my 12 year old MacBook Pro. The Touch ID pad makes my life easier.
Bough this for my mom. Battery life is great & it’s so sleek that we can take it anywhere without it taking up space. also the price for this is great I couldn’t find a better deal anywhere else.
Love my new MacBook Air!! Light, sleek, long lasting battery, plug & play! Surprised it does not have regular USB ports, but ordered 2-pack of USB to USB-C adapters for $10. Love all my Apple products from their packaging to their long lasting durability and fantastic performance/technology.
Love the lightweight and easy to set up/configure capabilities.  This is my first MAC although I have iPads and an Apple watch.  Though it might be scary to move from Windows, but not at all.  Like all Apple products - everything was seamless.  Great price as well..
I really enjoy my MacBook! Has became essential since I’ve gotten used to it!
The Best part of the Mac is the battery life. Not to take away from its sleek design and extremely light weight.
Happyyyyyy with this computer
Took a chance on an $899 MacBook Air. Figured it was a refurb (since it’s typically $1299). But it was brand new. Shirnkwrapped and all!
This was exactly what I was looking for. Got the beautiful Rose Gold colored edition which had been sold out in stores every time I looked. Fast delivery that arrived a day earlier than expected. Everything I wanted with no hassles.
I only have one thing I didn’t like.... it actually has nothing to do with the computer!I LOVE the computer but when the delivery guy destroyed our yard because they drove through it and got stuck is really aggravating! This is NOt the first time they have done this! And we have asked multiple times NOT to do it! We have multiple areas where Amazon workers have drove in our yard and messed it up!  They tell us that they will fix it but never do! My mother in law  and father in law are pissed so be prepared for a call from them :-)
Love it!!!!!
This is my first MAC and I love it
This was a gift for Christmas for my daughter who will be graduating in May 2021 and going off to college.  So, I wish I could give more feedback on it, my oldest has a bigger apple laptop and loves it for her school assignments she’s in a nursing program.
This low-end MacBook Air performs incredibly. It handles Lightroom and Photoshop like it's nothing. I can't believe the battery life as well - it'll run all day. I don't know how Apple did it, but they did. Very satisfied with this laptop.
I went everywhere attempting to purchase this MacBook. I couldn't even get it from apple since there's no in-store purchasing .. I was able to find and recieve within 1 day via amazon. As for the laptop itself Wonderful ... If you're considering I highly recommend.
The video quality is extremely poor, I have a Macbook Air from a previous employer without this issue. But the camera is extremely grainy and unfocused. Returning since most of my work is giving video presentations.Update: the camera somehow got better after a few days of use, I have no idea what happened. But a month of having this, it's getting glitchy. The processing speed is not the same and has a lot of lags.
I love MAC laptops. They are reliable and this one has the newest processor which is very fast and the screen has no frame. The only issue that this causes is a lot of finger smudges from opening it or adjusting the screen.
Screen gets dirty easily but amazing for anything you throw at it.
Buy it
This is the best mac out there. so light and sleek and tbh the battery m1 is insane
I absolutely love my new laptop it is 20x better than my other laptop because the battery life lasts longer and I can multitask multiple assignments all at the same time; also, it is a very reliable and the resolution and speed is amazing
It’s perfect. I wish I had got AppleCare as I thought I had ordered. But I said it up it’s fine.
I love it! Came in great packaging , I received my package extremely quickly and everything is working fine.
Great small lap top. Very, Very fast. Love it.
Purchased for my sister. She has used it for her schooling and loved it.
I love my new laptop the only draw back is that I have to purchase a USB-C to connect my phone.. other from that everything works well so far
idk what to say but this crazy MacBook is awesome apple makes a sweet ass tv. thanks apple for adding the extra keyboard for tapping on zzzzoooommmm!!!! its a really I am trying to figure the ins and outs of this thing always finding new stuff.
I am extremely happy with the MacBook Air but more impressed with the simplicity and efficiency of the Amazon ordering process.  The lengths Amazon has gone to provide an incredible purchasing process is impressive.  Amazon has a customer for life
I LOVEEEE IT ❤️ It’a everything I wanted, it works beautifully and it came fast and safe worth every penny !!
Amazing! Great value, great performance, great battery life, user experience is top notch
I never thought I would be saying an Apple product is best value for the money. This laptop does everything we need and more!
This was the easiest laptop set up ever! Love the rose gold color. Very easy to use and love the long battery life!
Very fast response, great screen quality- like it a lot so far.
"It is an amazing work of art created for longevity usage and fashioned for designed purpose".
M1 chip blows away any laptop on the market. It even blows away the pro version of this laptop. No internal fan and loss of efficiency is virtually non existent. Highly recommend
Great Processor
The speed is great compared to the older model I had. The one pain I have is exporting most documents I send out into PDF since almost of the people who I send to are on a window's platform.
I like that it is small and compact and easy to use.  Using it daily for many hours and hardly drains the battery at all.
Nothing
It's a great computer, very sturdy and strong. You have to take good care of it, though, if you get little crumbs inside the keyboard, it'll obviously stop working. Also, the gold color isn't really gold, it's more of a pink shade.
Love my new macbook. It's shipped as stated and was packed well. Came fast and was easy to set up.
I got it for 3 days ago and it's just awesome!I have no complaints, highly recommend to buy it
Great quality and value!  My fiancé talked me into buying Mac and I couldn’t be happier!
I don’t use it much I’m starting online college in the next few months. It’s my first Apple laptop so I’m pretty happy with it. I do use it at times and it never heats up.
Need another receipt please
We bought this computer out of insistence from my husband. He knew I wasn't an Apple/Mac fan, but this computer had made reconsider everything related to electronics. It's fast, efficient and simple.
Long battery life, super fast processing speed, cool fanless operation, lightweight, high build quality.  The M1 is an amazing step above Intel based laptops.  Easily my best laptop in last 10 years.
Overall great computer, my last MacBook Air was 8 years old so this is a great replacement BUT super disappointed that the charging cord isn’t magnetic like the old style
Battery life was wonderful. However, multiple issues with interacting with Zoom; which was a central reason for purchasing the MacBook. I have an Apple phone and thought a MacBook would be a great addition. Unfortunately, that was not  the case for me. If you aren’t familiar with MacBooks, it takes some adjusting to go from a laptop to a MacBook. I ended up returning the MacBook and purchased a laptop instead.
Very fast computer.  Lots pf fun for a first time Apple user.
Perfect size, lightweight, long battery life.
Nice one
its so beautiful and great for the value to, this laptop looks like its going to last many years
the camera is a joke , it's very bad .battery great for normal uses , but average for heavy uses
I love it! It was everything I asked for! It came on time and it was amazing! It was delivered with care and everything works amazingly great!
Works great!  Rosetta makes installing old Mac apps easy.  Performance is amazing at a relatively affordable (for Apple) price.  Best MacBook to be released in some time.
The laptop has a pre-set set-up but it’s confusing. Had to call for assistance then to Best Buy for help.
the only issue is that Ican not use more than 5 safari windowsopen at a time with no other apps openafter that any more applications cause extreme slow down
I have waited a long time to buy a MAC and I am not disappointed! I was surprised at what is inside the machine, incredible! Great price!
The battery life is amazing and the speaker are good too
The M1 is so fast. And I really like that they changed to keyboard on this model. They are raised more so I can actually feel when I'm pressing on them.
other being delivered late. it was perfect gpu and cpu are crazy fast so is the ssd and ram. it may be the best computer i have ever have had.
Very lightweight. Super fast.I only dislike that I have to buy apps that are free on my phone, but this is a great PC for what I need
Now that I am working at home part-time decided to upgrade my office. Very happy with this monitor - bought 2 and have them side by side.
No complains so far.  Very fast and performs great.  I had a 2014 MacBook Air and finally upgraded this year.  This is leagues beyond that entry and I’m very happy with this upgrade.
I just updated from a 10 year old Mac and there is no comparison of course. The Mac is awesome.
UPDATE: the battery is not dead - the motherboard is.The computer worked fine for 14 months and then the battery died. Wouldn't charge, wouldn't hold a charge while plugged in. I took it to the Apple store where they told me it would be $428 to fix the problem (I bought a replacement Microsoft laptop for less than that). They wanted me to complain to Amazon for selling me a dud when I was talking to them about fixing it. Bad customer service, don't stand behind their product, and I won't be buying a Mac again as it just turned out to be a $1000 paperweight.
I love it , for the price point it’s a steal! Absolutely worth it
It's light, it doesn't get hot at all, it looks and feels good. Not a computer expert but very happy with this computer.
very awesome laptop for its price for an apple device
Way beyond my expectation. This macbook shows outstanding performances when running machine learning programs and heavy illustration programs.It does not get hot at all, and most of all, it is super silent.
I absolutely love my MacBook Air! It’s so perfect!!
I have a MacBook Pro for work, and picked up this Air for personal use. I love that it is small, lightweight, and powerful. I would recommend.
This laptop is everything and more !!!!
Excellent for my needs. Really happy with my purchase 😊
Almost, since yesterday I was editing some videos and at some point it freezed a little.
No problems  Works great
This is well done, thanks Apple!
Front facing camera is only 720p, but everything else is perfect. Rose gold matches her Apple Watch, and made for an excellent follow up gift from last years Valentine.
Best laptop I have had so far!
Love my new MacBook Air!!  Using it all the time 😁 Took awhile to get used to the Mac after having  a PC ... but I’m getting there 🤩
What is there to say. It’s the best laptop around. Duhh!!!
To hard to set up and use. Not real computer literate, old man. Always used android computers. First MacBook and at this point would not buy again.  Have iPhone, iPad, and I something for music. Those are easy to use. Not the MacBook. Bought brand new, won’t buy a MacBook next time. Haven’t used it once since I got it. Heard they were so much better than androids. Don’t think so.
Like a mac product...once you know about them...they are awesome ...would never use a junky pc again
OMG I'm loving my new computer. It's working great. Perfect size for me and very light-weight. Has Touch ID as well.
Good solid computer for paying bills, writing, a d playing a few games. My wife uses it all the time.
I got this laptop for Christmas and absolutely love it! It is so lightweight but very powerful. The camera quality is also great! Highly recommend!
Switching from PC to Mac was a breeze with this computer!  Light weight, fast processing and now all of my devices are synced.
Battery life +++++Screen *****No fan = no noise and it stays cool to the touch even when running games.
I am using this product and am very happy about it.
It was time...my 2015 laptop was showing some signs of wear and out-dating. It didn't take much adjustment to upgrade my brain. ;-)
Works perfectly well. Exactly as shown.
Product is completely brand new. I can’t see a flaw on it. I totally love it. Now my wife want one 🤣🤣
Had to take computer to Apple care center because after spending 3 hours in the phone with Apple support they couldn’t help me anymore. Thankfully  computer was under warranty so I didn’t pay  and they were able to fix it but the closest apple care was 2 hours from my home. Computer works great now though!
It took me some getting used to but I love my Mac Book.
Very light computer. No fan, no noise. Very responsive and fast.
LOVE IT

Love love love it! Perfect condition. Nice color of screen, runs fast, battery life great!
This would’ve been the perfect laptop if it wasn’t for those pesky kids, and that mangy mutt. In other words, the built in camera, sucks.
I got this for my husband, he’s a captain on a boat and this excellent size, light weight. He absolutely loves it
Excellent Work really good i like it..
It's fast, lightweight, and the keyboard is great
The front camera is horrible! I expected more but other than that this computer is user friendly and efficient.
Great laptop
So easy to use one of my better purchases
Nothing wrong with the MacBook itself. It was just not practical for me what I needed for my work. So I started a return. First you send them the product I guess in good faith. Then once they receive the item then with in 7 days they will refund your purchase. Mind you I returned this in the complete original package only 4 days after receiving it. It’s going on 2 months and nothing but Crickets from everyone. Buyer Beware!!
Great battery life, and accomplishes everything I need done.
It was packaged very well. And I’m very pleased with the quality of it. I definitely recommend buying it for sure.
Absolutely perfect! Amazing price and super good quality
Received product wrapped brand new packaging. Everything has worked perfectly.
no complaints overall very sleek and firm
I am really happy with my Mac air ., just what I wanted., fast and nice , to reading and write
Screen quality is great and battery lasts long it takes me a couple of days before putting it on a charger
No usb port for microhone use
I ordered the gold finish. Took my breath away upon unboxing. Beautiful.
space grey is perfect
10/10 recommend, battery life is fantastic I charged it when I first got it & it’s still at 97%
These new MacBook Air’s have come a long way since my last one. It’s a great little computer for the price
Perfect size and lightweight!
The laptop was just as if I bought it from Apple myself, only it was cheaper AND in the color I wanted!
So many neat features!
Excellent computer at a reasonable cost.Love it!
Working well for my wife
Love yes the real thing works good pretty loud honestly camera should be better for what it’s worth battery life is pretty good
love this product!  Set up was super fast and easy for this modern elder, and love the integration with my other apple devices!
If you're in the market for a new laptop, I can't recommend this computer highly enough. Excellent computer. No complaints. Love it. Five stars.
I love the size, speaks, keyboard is very fine touch, but the camera isn’t too great for the product like this.
I like the portability and ease of use. The battery life is excellent.
Good
Came in perfect condition, love it 😍 Worth every penny 🤩
Yes, there are "thousands " of apps available as advertised. They do not include popular apps such as Amazon, Facebook, Spectrum  Instagram or Sprint. Work related apps like Indeed and LinkedIn. Other apps for stores we like to shop at.  You can access these website on the browser. FYI, that's how I accessed websites on my very first laptop...in 1997.  Works great for reading email and Facetime.
love the quality, you should definitely get one!! came quick as well!!
I love it omg 😟. The camera quality is ok but not the best, little grainy.
Perfect！
would tell all my friends
this computer is great I really like it a lot. I highly recommend  to anyone looking for quality and durability.
Works great, fast, easy to set up.
Love it so much!
A fantastic present for myself beautiful pictures taken  on this delightful camera computer works nice!!
Amazon battery life, very fast, simple to use.
This is my first Apple computer and it is a great computer.  I’m very pleased with it.
I love my juicy apple 😁
This mac is wesome, my favorite laptop so far (i have 3 lol) Thank you so much Apple.
Starting with the package to the daily work, the best purchase of this month.  Apple products are amazing!
The one we received worked just fine. However, it’s uneven so when I try to sit it on a flat surface to type, it rocks. Rather annoying and something I never thought of before.
Very happy customer! I'm glad I bought this brand new instead of refurbished.  Great computer! Love it!
Love this laptop best purchase yet! Screen quality is amazing battery lasts forever and camera quality is great!!
Brand new and on time. Thanks Amazon.
Great battery life
I was happily surprised to see how good the battery life was compared to my other computers
Bought it going off of the reviews and we absolutely love it !!
Exactly as advertised very fast computer
Amazing product!! Love the features and that it pairs with all of my other Apple products!!
is the only thing is most blocking but with external ssd its solved or managed your storage, it is a great product
This is a superb machine. Outstanding battery life. Very fast as well. I would recommend 10 out of 10
I really like the Mac products and that's why I bought this for my 2nd home.
I love my MacBook Air.  I use it for work all day long for zoom call meetings and the camera never fails.
Without any additional word I'd say that MBA M1 is the best 2020 device with phenomenal battery life
Getting used to it.  I’m 74 so would prefer an instruction book to trying things out.  Enjoying it so far.
Amazing product
Absolutely love it!!!! Came on time battery life is good i absolutely love the color

I bought my computer in Feb 2021. Now it is April 2022 and it shuts itself off without warning, with a defective pink screen. I'd be surprised if it lasts throughout the month. I'm not sure if this is due to planned obsolescence, or some other reason. Either way, I am not impressed. One year is not a good shelf life for a computer. My previous MacBook lasted only 2 years before it shut itself down for good. My older MacBook Pro from 2012 still works, so I know that it is not me that is the problem.
Super computer. This is my second MacBook air that I have bought this year (one for my girlfriend). I really love it.
Everything is good with my MacBook however the MacBook is totally overrated. I prefer the HP well let’s just say anything not apple.
Best laptop ever!
I’m happy with the product this far.Arrived on time.
The camera sucks, it's really blurry. Aside from that I have no complaints. However, that's a big one for this to be so expensive.
Great MacBook. Slim and light weight. Starts up fast. Price was another reason I bought it on Amazon.
Camera quality
Arrived quickly and packaged well. Laptop has many features and a very nice operating system and capabilities.
My Son used it for school and to download pictures he has taken. Easy to use and fast!
Arrow key squeaked a little. Other than that, very pleased to have a new laptop.
Looked forward to this new MacBook Air.  Loved the Magic Keyboard, but everything else seems half-baked Apple.I didn't know enough to immerse myself in the (hard-to-find)  Essentials Manual before touching the FORCE touchpad.  Took a long time that to realize that "force"  really meant FORCE (as in "smash it down" )  There is a System Preferences bypass, but I got embroiled in a DARK MODE display (black screen), missing cursor, and of course loss of Intel-chip based favorite apps which all took precedence over trying to find and read a possible Manual.  Help menu did not help..I tried, I really did.  Apple Support suggested and helped for 2 days, with hours spent trying over & over to erase, then Reinstall Big Sur  software, but 2 hours loading (for each of dozens of tries), then "An error occurred preparing this update.  Please try again."was too much, over and over.  This software is not ready for primetime.  Looking forward to AIR's next iteration.Meanwhile, I must be content with my older MacBook Pro, while MacBoo Air is returned:  "rest in peace".
Daughtzr loves it!
small very easy to carry, good quality. had one before for 7 year no problem .
Beautiful. The camera is not what I was expecting but besides that, awesome
Shipping was fast and it came as expected.
Love this machine. have had it a couple months and it's fast battery lasts insanely long.
Feels faster than any high powered desktop. This thing is unreal. Never even gets warm
Perfect
I-am coming from Dell to the Mac its easy to learn and use.
Everything I wanted in a laptop and more
Fast delivery.  Great product.  Really — this computer is amazing.  So much better than my 145b.
Love that its compact and can take it anywhere - fast and easy to use.
So far great learning a Mac system though but can find help at every corner of the net
Bought one for myself last week. Love it so much bought one for my husband 😊
Great laptop.Long battery life.
Everything goes well. Working smoothly
I bought it for home use and am still finding new features to learn about.
Excellent battery life! I love everything about this MacBook. The only let down was the camera quality.
Not sure what Apple is going with their products, but what the hell is wrong with their screen and camera quality?However, my first MACBOOK, battery charging (AWESOME and FAST), battery life (IMPECABLE), efficiency (GREAT)...STARTUP (SUPER SLOW)
I am A Mac person. Love the computer. As always. Easy to use.
The battery life is awesome, just one charged in a day in case you use it for demanding tasks.
It has been working wonderful! Super light, fast and great quality!
Grandson loves it
Love it. Everything I expected it to be. Very satisfied.

Translate review to English
Great computer very fast long lasting battery verily high quality
I love this new MacBook air full recommended.
The macbook air M1 arrived totally dead with no charging cable or power brick.  The laptop was extremely beat up, scratched everywhere and completely grimy and dirty.  It looks like it was never cleaned.  The hinge also has wear and the lid does not want to stay up.  an utter and complete piece of crap.
Works great. No problems.
Everything as expected.  Happy with purchase
Simply the best!
We really like our Apple MacBook Air!
Great Product, Great Price
Love my MacBook
Highly recommended
Excelente Producto
Bought it for Wife. She loves it.
Great product arrived on time and performs as expected.
love it. better than previous laptop
Excellent performance and long battery life
Fastest computer I’ve ever had.
Apple has gone through 3 Big Sur OS updates and there's still quirks to deal with. I end up re-starting sometimes just to get software booted up and documents retrieved from iCloud.
Just amazing on a new chip & with the battery life!
I was so excited to buy my first MacBook.  Opened the first one and nothing zip, zero, dead. Charged it, called Apple, who told me to return it.  It took over an hour to get Amazon to accept the return and ship me a replacement.  Next morning get MacBook number 2- super excited because I open it and it comes on and sings a song! Loved it for the 3 hours it worked.  It updated and Locked me out.  Did everything they told me to do online, call Apple that admits they are having this issue and I can return it for another one! Since it’s not 14 days old.  No thanks.  I am done.  Since Apple told me to return it this time Amazon was amazing and is picking it up for return tomorrow.  This was a crappy experience.  I love my iPad Pro and iPhones- no more MacBook for me.
Absolutely love, love, love my laptop!!!
This is a Mac.  I like the products, but this little Mac could not do what I needed.  I returned the product, it has been received at the warehouse but my money is still not returned.  I the computer for 2 days and then Insent back.  Please refund my money.
Awesome display and super fast!!
Great computer for the money.
It’s perfect. As you’d expect.
Product smelled like it was stored in a warehouse that was moist and musty. I’m glad I bought the extended warranty.

Amazing
Good experiences with it.
Just simply beautiful
A+
Back in 2020 I put the laptop on once. Tried to set it up and then shut it off since I couldn’t do it. Tried to turn it back it on in 2022 and it would not charge. Bought a battery from Apple and it still won’t turn in ! Such a waste of money for something I can’t even use.
Feels very impressive to own
Love this MAC!!!
The title says it all.
Exactly what I needed.
Great!!
It's a very good computer.
worth the money ;)
Great love it
Perfect for my personal business.
No problems with the unit in the first month.  First update was a little buggy but seems to be working alright.  I'd say this computer is about what I expected.
Love everything about it.
None

Lovely. Just amazing.
Apple never disappoints.
Original
Unfortunately I bought this laptop new, brand new in box, then after editing large files for photography, I noticed I had no storage very quickly. Starting cleaning the laptop up and realized it was used.  Found a couple who had a few video files of their trip to Mexico. Several other files I had never seen before and had my tech guy at work clean it up and he could tell right away it was used. Really disappointing I paid for the NEW versus the used and still got a used laptop.  It works great but still fraudulent. Just be careful ordering these off of amazon.
Amazing
I love it
Excellent
Best laptop
Amazing
Super fast
I had my mac for one day before it quit working—it was installed with Big Sur, which has a bug in it causing the trackpad to malfunction. No trackpad = no way of using your laptop (especially because it won’t recognize an external mouse with this bug. I paid over a thousand dollars to have a computer for a single day. While it worked, the speed was great and the screen crystal clear, but both of those are pointless without a way to use the computer. I’m doing the 3-hour software update now to (hopefully) fix the problem, but I highly recommend purchasing a different computer.
Great laptop.
Bought 2 ipads, could not connect to internet, wasted money.  Bought an expensive phone, needed assembly, never worked, wasted money.  Bought a new MacBook, in setup after argument to use English, when I entered the Wi-Fi password 3 times, it never accepted it, it went nuts and sailed off into disability screens I could not fathom.  The touchpad seems not to work.  Does not have a USB port, without using an external mouse is less than junk to me.  Now we start pulling teeth, scheduled a return, will I get credit?RUN FROM APPLE PRODUCTS ! ! !
Don’t appreciate how I received a used macbook with fingerprints on the screen. They tried to put the film back on the screen as it was originally, but it wasn’t stuck to the screen as it should have been. I returned it because i refuse to spend that much money on something someone else had their hands one. It’s unacceptable especially due to covid. I went and bought one locally and it was brand new no fingerprints and the film was stuck to the screen as it should be because thats how Apple packages it.
Had to replace the screen with warranty, it came with burned pixels. Other than that, good laptop
Impossible to use the camera. Had to purchase and external camera.
Waiting for credit from Amazon on return via UPS. We were unable to have this laptop work with Zoom no audio or video and it was unstable with the Google Chrome browser. My son is a software engineer for a San Francisco Social media company and he thinks that this new processing chip being used by Apple is problematic.
Their support staff created more problems than I could ever have and i have wasted at least 20 hours on hold and trying to get Apple to set up my new MAC and I still cannot use this computer.  I am seriously thinking to send back and hoping I can!
Very disappointing. Those 2 USB c ports as the only ports, is the most disappointing thing ever. Also, it runs out of memory quite often. I only stick with it because of a software I need. Otherwise, I stick to my windows laptop and stay sane
I loved my computer and the affirm payment plan. My husband had me purchase as my Christmas gift. I have had it less then 3 months but over the Amazon exchange time and it's a paper weight because the keyboard no longer works. Cautious is all I can say when buying electronics of expense from Amazon.
It’s very nice but isn’t what I need
I only had this MacBook for two days and the screen started to peel off. there's no screen protector or any other film covering the screen. I noticed there was a bubble on the top right corner and it started to peel off, revealing a white screen.
The MacBook Air is convenient like every other computer used daily and is compactible due to size. It goes for the high price of thirteen hundred dollars with very little features besides its editing equipment. The computer’s processing chip isn’t the best on the market, which makes the computer work slow a while after using. It’s a simple use for a computer with very little storage, but it keeps things organized and easy to find. Sometimes files tend to glitch out of the memory causing me to redo a few assignments. The screen has a clear picture, which makes it better when having to read and do homework. The computer itself is very clean and simple to use but doesn’t come with feature that most high-priced computer have.  After paying a heavy amount on a computer the features it has is limited compared to buying an iPad for the same price.
honestly this laptop is garbage!!!! I HAD a macbookpro from 2013 that was almost neck on photoshop and illustrator being almost 10 years old ! like cumoon ! … oh and u have to buy a dam dongle because it only comes with 2 usbc connections and u know dam welll one is for charging ! … also if u dont have another mac dont eveer open disk utility because u need a secoond one if u erase ur hardrive
I never write reviews but I’m taking time to write this one.tried to save some money on a open box Mac never again with Amazon they have horrible quality control could not even get through setup without it freezing up and then it does not recognize my Apple ID returning and going to bestbuy would of reordered with Amazon but have to wait till return is received and then then they will mail one out that’s going to take maybe two weeks total time I don’t think so never again
Only 8gb ram. The most this thing can do is watch YouTube and send emails
3 hours with apple support  - with no relief in sight - no way to turn off favorites side which pops up when ever it wants - need an additional lap top will not purchase this again
I love my IPad so I thought this would be great but it is not. No touch screen. I am having trouble even using it. Total waste of my money.
I only had this MacBook for two days and the screen started to peel off. there's no screen protector or any other film covering the screen. I noticed there was a bubble on the top right corner and it started to peel off, revealing a white screen.
Good evening. I purchased a brand new computer in March with the hope that i would be using a system trouble free. To my surprize not many days after... i notice the screen start flickering. I would would like this to be attended to ASAP as this is the only gadget for school work.
I bought this just to try Apple and I absolutely hate it the layout, no touch screen, keys are hard to type on bc super small and the worst is trying to return it. Return option is only 1 and its been such a hassle to even return it and you get charged
So far, I've had to have this repaired twice. First time, it needed a new board and screen. Second time, a new Thunderbolt port. Amazon won't accept a return or exchange because it's past the return date.
Very bad contrast. Very bad video resolution.
No instructions what to do when something is not working. I can not connect to the blue tooth and the apple stores are closed in my town. I don’t know how to fix it
The unit is smaller than the original Air, also it has NO USB ports, the description on the page is misleading and they never show the right-hand side of the unit in the pictures, otherwise, I would have never bought it, Amazon return policy is horrible they take 2 weeks to refund your money, took it out looked at it said nope, didn't even registered it.  Waste of time and money.
Item was delivered dented, I’m not sure if it was the manufacture or delivery company but I definitely am not happy.
After 2 months their is a error that I can’t turn my videos at all. I watch YouTube to fix it but didn’t work. I am pretty upset and not happy.
I really haven't used this as of yet.  All the Macs I have had in the past except one were A quality in all respects
It stopped working after 10 months 😞I just don’t understand how in less than a year my computer screen goes black. This computer never fell so I want to speak with a customer service representatives.
I purchased for my son to use for school, it stopped working after two weeks, I spent the past two weeks working with Apple who can't get it to function.  I contacted Amazon to replace, they have refused to replace and continue to re-direct me to Apple.  Don't buy an Apple computer from Amazon, they will not replace it even if defective.
I was able to snag one of these for $700 with the M2 MacBook Air arriving the day after I am writing this review. If it was in this price bracket all the time, it would be a no brainer best choice, and I am having a hard time finding worthy competition even at its $1,000 msrp range.What it does well:Trackpad-  The trackpad on the MacBook Air is unbelievable. Using pressure sensitivity to simulate clicks on a piece of glass, the MacBook lineup puts all other laptop manufacturers on notice. This is a best in class experience.Keyboard-  Say what you will about laptop keyboards but this is a phenomenal typing experience. The only type of keyboard I would rather be using is a mechanical keyboard, but in this form factor, it is as good as it gets. The only complaints I have are that the arrow keys are really small.Display-  The display provides a fantastic viewing experience. I thought this is where the laptop would fall behind its more expensive counterparts with OLED and Mini LED displays, but the color accuracy, respectable 400 nit peak brightness, and 2560 x 1600 resolution are leaps better than anything I have experienced on an HP or Lenovo device. I wish the display was slightly bigger, but do not mind using it at all. This is a very good display for the money.Build Quality-  Apple just continues to excel at building things.Speakers-  Solid speakers with exceptional clarity, volume, and bass. Better than anything I have owned before it.What it does bad:Gaming-  Do not buy this laptop with the hopes that you can game on it. Most games I thought of installing were not available on Mac OS. It is in this category that Windows dominates the market.IO-  You get 2 USB C ports and a headphone jack. This fits my lifestyle just fine, but I cannot speak for everyone. It is up to you to determine whether you can live without USB A, HDMI out, or SD Readers built in.Base Hardware-  At this price point, 256gb is not enough. 512 should be the standard, not a $160 add on.
Came broken still no refund 6 months
I’ve had this for a few months and the SCREEN turning black with lines. Can’t fix it. Keeps glitching and it’s bad performance for the price absolutely not worth it. It’s all just aesthetically pleasing that’s it nothing more. Save yourself some money.
Quut working within a week from purchasing. Screen would freeze up and flicker. Screen eventually went black and would reset itself causing loss if previous work.
If your clumsy get a better laptop
DO NOT BUY. This computer has had issues from day 1. I’ve had to go to the Mac store 3 times now and I’m going again on Monday. It’s always a new issue. USELESS!!!!!!!
I had several problems so took the MacBook Air into Best Buy for help.  I was told I had received "a lemon" and should return it to Amazon.  I had it 3 weeks so was able to return it for a refund which I am waiting for right now.  I have loved my 2012 MacBook Air and am hoping the next one I order will be okay.
Screen broke just a week outside of one year. Warranty. It’s a $500 repair. This is insane.
This piece of junk is unable to connect wirelessly to  my printer.  My 10 year old mac has no problems printing on my Epson printer.  I have tried everything suggested and it still claims my printer is OFFLINE.It won't even find the printer when it is connected to it with a USB cable.  I think Apple has really screwed this product up.
Lasted 1 year and a half and had to pay $692 to replace the logic board. I would buy a laptop with an M1 to avoid overheating
$900 later and the sceeen quit on me. Don’t think I’ll be buying another computer from Amazon.
The Mac is great as a school computer and i use it almost everyday. With that being said I dont have to charge it often and it has little to no problems. Overall a great product.
I don’t like this very much I Kant get the app that I need and like
Excelent product
I PURCHASED A NEW MacBook Air, AND I RECEIVED A USED ONE WITH SOFTWARE ALREADY IN INSTALLED BY SOMEONE IN THE UK. THE CURSER WOULD STICK AND THE COMPUTER WOULD SHUT DOWN, TERRIBLE FOR A PRICE OF OVER $900.
My first Apple product. So far finding it difficult to set up. No instructions. Not intuitive at all. All my android were much easier to use right out of the box. Still trying to figure out how to load a program. Grrr
So far this has been a horrible experience.
Sent it back. Not what I wanted or advertised.
This is a very good laptop and easy to use.  A few things I've noticed is the backlit keyboard is very nice and adjusts automatically.  The keyboard is easy to type on and get used to and the touchpad is great.  The battery is extremely good too.I also use Apple Music and was pleased to find that spacial audio (Dolby Atmos) music songs played back on the Airs speakers and sounds amazing compared to high res stereo tracks.It's these little things I've found out about while using this computer that just amazes me all the time after just two weeks of ownership.  I would have bought it at Amazon but I could pick it up at my local BestBuy for 899 dollars when I got it.
This laptop is not compatible with anything. If you are a DELL user you will HATE it.You have to purchase a docking station or you won't have enough ports. You can't save word docs to your desktop.  The only positive is the battery life.
my new 13in Macbook Air has a lot of fingerprints on the INSIDE of the glass screen. It's on the top left corner down the left side and starts along the bottom. I don't like it .
i cant image how come apple will put such a low resolution camera on a 1000 laptop. i bought it mainly for zoom meeting but it's not to my expectation, so i returned it
This MacBook is excellent. I’ve had it for a year now and it’s impressing me more than I thought it ever would. Every day, straight for 1 year and it’s working like a beast, the only thing is to not eat over it as the keyboard gets pretty mucky and you have to get it deep cleaned. In conclusion, this computer is more than a beast than my old 2015 Macbook Pro
This is the best laptop I’ve ever owned for a few reasons.SPEEDIt’s lightning fast. The M1 chip almost never struggles, opening apps and web pages in seconds.SCREENThe screen is very high resolution with little glare. There’s NO TOUCHSCREEN, but I didn’t even notice until I’d owned it for a month cause I don’t use that.BUILD QUALITYIt’s sturdy, light, and durable. It’s powder coated so it doesn’t scratch easily, but when it’s not pretty.macOSThe operating system is great on its own, but with an iPhone it’s incredible. Messages, photos, websites, and mail from your phone just appear on your laptop.I don’t know if another laptop that hits all these points for under $1000.Now as for the cons…Not enough storage - 256gb is not enough. You can get by if all you do is browse the web and use Microsoft word, but for anything beyond that you’ll need AT LEAST 512gb.Gaming - macOS has a very small selection of gaming options. It’s not a gaming machine, but it’s laughably small.For the games it does have, the fps and speed is reasonable. It’s not incredible, but like I said it’s not a gaming machine.
Fraud.
THIS COSTS TWICE AS MUCH AS A DELL OR LENOVO COMPUTER - AND IT'S SCREEN IS SMALLER THAN MY IPAD!  THE 13" IS A DIAGONAL MEASUREMENT!  ROFL!!!!
i've had my m1 macbook air (16 gb ram, 512 gb storage) for about a year, and it's the best computer i've ever owned. for the majority of users, the base model will be enough, but if you want to upgrade ram, it's not a bad choice. works amazing for everything i do, screen quality is great, audio is pretty good, performance is amazing. all around great laptop for 95% of people.
The MacBook keeps looping and I am unable to set up the MacBook, I just got it today
Not even a year old and it died on me.
They love it and say its perfect.
The battery only lasts a few hours before it is dead, despite being used for menial tasks that do not typically drain a battery much. Not at all what I was expecting based on their marketing.
I read the comments and it seemed legit but when I received my package, I didn’t get a MacBook. I got a broken HP with no charger!!! Now I have to wait forever for my refund
Everything in the boxes except for the laptop smelled  musty At some point the boxes and accessories came in contact with water then dried out.
The 2020 MacBook Air BigSur OS is one of the newest computers on the market at the moment and one of Apple’s best designs. Apple has had many MacBook models throughout their many years of being the best electronic company, but The BigSur OS has many features that other models and other company computers do not have. This MacBook comes with high quality upload speed, all-day battery life, and superfast memory, which makes it the best choice for any computer or laptop right now. For a student and any other user, upload speed is definitely one of the most important qualities on a computer. This MacBook’s upload speed is fast enough that it can be considered a gaming laptop also. It has an Apple M1 Chip with an eight-core CPU which delivers up to almost four times as fast as past generations. This M1 Chip is designed by Apple designers themselves which other companies do not have access to. This BigSur is the quickest computer on the computer and laptop market which puts Apple as the highest revenue electronic company. Battery-life is another quality that is essential to many people, especially a student in the year 2021. Many universities and high schools have switched to using mainly online tests, textbooks, notes, and activities. All day battery-life is important because some students are using their computer up to nine hours a day with school, homework, and studying for tests and quizzes. This MacBook uses lithium polymer batteries which provide up to 18 hours of battery life. These batteries also are good for the environment and conservation. These are the best batteries for computers because they provide the best life and are good for the environment. Good memory and lots of storage are also crucial qualities of a computer. This MacBook can be used for up to ten years if there are not any software problems. This MacBook has eight GB of unified memory that makes everything you do have fast upload speed and responsiveness. Having enough memory and storage is great. For example, a student or a teacher would need to save documents, projects, notes and many more things. If there is not enough storage to do those things that a student needs to do then things will end up lost and not recovered. A lot of storage is also needed for a gamer because there needs to be space to download the games and have room for any spontaneous updates that might occur. Good memory and storage are important to many people and that's what makes the BigSur OS the best computer on the market. The MacBook BigSur has many pros that other computers just do not have and is a reasonable price for all the features it comes with. This model is an amazing choice for students, teachers, gamers, engineers, IT workers, and anyone who uses their computer a lot. The MacBook BigSur OS definitely continues to be one of the top rated computers and gives users a big bang for their buck.
This laptop is the best
One of the ports is defective.
Through the past year and a half, students have had to use personal computers and laptops for everyday tasks, most importantly being school. From my personal experience I believe that the MacBook Air 2020 is the best tool for the job. If you plan to frequently use a personal computer or laptop in the future, the MacBook Air is the right choice because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility that it uses.First, the MacBook Air 2020 is amazingly convenient to use throughout the day because of its ability to hold a charge and how quickly it gets charged. In my school days I did not have very much time to worry about the battery life of my computer. Now I do not have to do that at all because I only need to charge my computer once to twice a week and its 30 hour charge. Next, the apple compatibility that it uses, including Apple music, iMessage, Facetime, etc., makes this product very easy to use while not having to use multiple devices to do actions such as getting a photo from your photos or getting that one picture from a text. This apple compatibility lets you see all of these things and not have to worry about changing devices to do so. Finally, is the processing speed and storage. The MacBook Air 2020 has a processor that is considered to be great for gaming and running large applications within the computer. This makes the computer amazingly fast while doing average school work and using it for everyday life. Although it is expensive, the MacBook Air has been considered to be the best for its price out of all of the MacBooks, including computers such as the MacBook Pro. The strange thing that the MacBook has is amazing showing its slim appearance and lightweight feel. The storage that is available with the MacBook is 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, or 2TB, but most went with 512GB. These large amounts of storage are fantastic, showing that one of the MacBook Air's biggest competitors(Dell XPS 13) only lets you choose between 128GB and 256GB. Now if you want to have a large amount of pictures or apps on your computer that kind of storage just won't cut it. For these reasons the MacBook Air 2020 is the best choice for daily use and school work because of its processing speed and storage, ability to keep a charge, and the apple compatibility.Overall, the MackBook Air has the processing speed, storage capacity, battery life, and the apple compatibility to make it the best choice for a laptop or personal computer. Throughout the last year and a half, I have had to be on my computer a lot to do school work and many other things. Getting this computer has not only helped me do this quicker, but has improved the quality of my work because of its nice layout and convenience.
Yay, spent a G on a new grey screen of death.  A month after the return was received by amazing... still no refund.  Spend the extra $150 and get it from Apple.  Duh?
Computer was not able to charge are a monthe or so. Took to Apple reps stated could not help me that day because Amazon is a 3rd vendor.
neither me or my brilliant techie friends could make it even to the third screen of demands without becoming locked out.  Back to PCs .
product came activation locked, Amazon has no idea what they're doing, now I have to return a brick.i'm sure the laptop is nice though, I've used one elsewhere
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Okay, this is a great MacBook, and a significant improvement over its predecessors, very fast laptop. As a student here are my pros and cons.PROS:-Portable for me to carry, I got a hard case for it and a sleeve and it is very portable at 13"-Battery life is fantastic, I literally charged it to 80% yesterday afternoon at 3:00PM, now, as I write this review, it is still going, at 4:06 PM, with 39%. In the past 10-12 hours, I've been using photoshop and Final Cut Pro, finishing my essay and FaceTiming a old friend, it is amazing-M1, the processor is super fast, even though this thing doesn't have a fan, it doesn't get hot at all, I have not seen this thing get warm a single time.-The keyboard, let me put it this way, it is VERY SATISFYING, many people have many opinions about it, but I come from using a MacBook 2017 and Asus Vivobook, this keyboard is very good, has great travel and it isn't mushy.-Display is also very good, gets bright enough, even in direct sunlight and keyboard backlight is adjustable, something I haven't been able to do on my windows laptops.CONS:-App support, plainly putting it, app support sucks other than applications that are optimized for the m1, even as of 2022, but my main apps work, like Final Cut Pro, photoshop and Lightroom.-Webcam sucks, it's still 720p, and much worse than my Asus, it's serviceable but not good.
So slow and constantly freezing.
Got used crap was supposed to be brand new
I love this computer, just about everything is made so well on it. I have always been a fan of apple products; about two years ago when my old computer stopped working, I decided to get a MacBook and would absolutely recommend this product. One of my favorite things is the size, it is so easy to carry or fit into almost all bags. Due to the fact that I am an avid apple user, it is super beneficial that all my photos, passwords, and documents are so conveniently transferred to each of my devices. The only bad thing is some softwares are not supported within the apple computer which can be inconvenient for someone who may be a college student like me. Otherwise, the computer is great for college students who do not mind emailing the teacher or going through some loop holes to complete the class.
There are lots of ghost images
When I was in college, I used both mac and PC and after I graduated I switched exclusively to PC because of the versatility (gaming and upgradability). When I decided to go back to grad school, I decided to give Apple another chance with this laptop because I heard great things and high expectation with the new m1 chip design. I was not disappointed.This new CPU has great speeds and this macbook air runs fantastic for daily moderate use (browsing the web, watching videos, reading, studying, etc. ). I can go to a cafe and use this laptop all day without having to charge it. Also, it's so compact and thin that it's easy to take everywhere! compared to my old macbook from 2012, it is incredibly light. I always had the notion that apple made heavy laptops, but this definitely is easy to carry around.As someone who used a desktop, the keyboard was a bit harder to adapt to. The keys don't have a deep switch as a normal keyboard has, but considering the size of the laptop, it is expected. I can see it being an issue with its small screen. Although it is convenient for me, the size can be inconvenient for those hard of sight. Lastly, the price is steep for a laptop. A PC variant with this money can be used to buy a gaming laptop where Apple normally lacks, but I have yet to try the Apple Arcade on my macbook air. It is also only USB-C which is a turn-off to many, but with a dongle, it is not a problem for me.I would say if you are looking for a laptop to work or study with, this is an easy grab. Make sure you buy a dongle along side of it.TL;DRPros:- battery life- m1 chip- size (easy to carry around)- weightCons:- keyboard- size (screen is a bit small for some)- price- only USB-C
I was hesitant to get a smaller Macbook after my 15" 2015 Macbook Pro started to suffer from keyboard issues.  I repaired the keyboard twice, so there must have been something wrong with voltage regulation to it.Anyhow, I couldn't resist the idea of an ARM based Macbook, so I went with the 2020 13" Macbook Air since I don't think the Pro model had Apple Silicon yet.  I could be wrong on that.Long story short, it meets all my needs with flying colors!  It turns out that I'm perfectly comfortable with a 13" screen and that I don't need a bigger one.Everything great about this Macbook:- It's *fast*!  Don't let the "Air" moniker deceive you.  Unless you're into heavy gaming, this is the laptop for you.  ARM processors are the future of consumer computing.- The battery life is *insane*.  I still can't comprehend how many hours this thing survives unplugged.  I take it on flights across the country and never need to plug in or get worried that I will run out of power, even when I'm charging my phone off it!- It's slim and light!  Perfect for traveling.- It is completely solid state with no moving parts!  No fan whirring or anything like that.- As an extension of the first point, it runs ARM builds of Windows insanely well with Parallels.  It can even run Halo: CE at near full speed!- macOS is very stable.- The retina screen is nice.- Despite what people are saying about the camera, it's actually better than the one on my old Macbook Pro.  (this isn't to say that the camera is *good*, but it's adequate IMO)- All things considered, the M1 Macbook Air is incredible value and really a great deal for the price.- It has a larger touchpad than my old Macbook Pro but not quite as bit as the one on current 13" Macbook Pros.  I find this preferable because it is just the right size where I'm not constantly hitting it with my palm as I type.  If you type a lot then the touchpad on this laptop will probably annoy you less while still having plenty of surface area.- No touchbar!!!  Halleluja!!!!- Decent sound from the speakers considering the size constraint.There are some cons, but they are pretty minor IMO:- Only the left side has USB-C ports, in contrast to the Pro which has them on both sides.  The right side *does* have an analog audio jack, however, if that's useful to you.  However, I've managed fine without USB on the right side.- It would be nice if I didn't have to click the fingerprint sensor button to get it to sense my finger and wake the system.  On pros, the fingerprint sensor is always active.- If you are one of the 3 people on the planet who want the touchbar, this will not have it. (I however consider this a good thing)- Although the speakers have improved in quality since previous Air models, the Pro is still going to have better sounding speakers.  You may feel like you've gotten a bit of a downgrade in that regard if you are coming from a Pro model.  Personally, I've gotten used to it plus I use AirPods most of the time anyway.- The Air does NOT have an HDMI port, but you can buy an (expensive) adapter that will provide HDMI.- Storage capacity is workable but limited.  Would be nice to get at least 1 TB of storage in the future.  In the meantime I just back stuff up on to an external drive and periodically clear my downloads folder.I'm a software engineer and the M1 Macbook Air exceeds my needs and expectations.  I think I'll just be buying the Air model in the future because it's terrific value for the price point.  $999 might be expensive for some, but I can assure you that it's a robust laptop so you are saving money in the long run.  I've owned many non-Apple laptops in the past and I ended up hating all of them.  On the other hand, I never regret owning an Apple device.  This is coming from someone who formerly used Windows and Linux.  I got tired of both the hardware and software breaking down quickly.  Apple isn't perfect... my last Macbook Pro chugged along for over 6 years until the keyboard repeatedly failed, but that still beats all previous laptops I owned that had numerous problems unrelated to how I treated them.
As a gamer I must say although I love my computer it does not last anywhere near 18 hours. Maybe because I am gaming. But it does not last 5-6 while I am gaming. When I am working or watching tv shows my battery also dies kinda fast. I don't like to use my laptop and charge so I let it charge normally but that's my only problem is the fact that the battery is nothing like they said it would be. But neither are our phones lol. Other than that its a great light way, easy on the go, laptop that works very well for business. Not so much gaming as the battery is low. May be just mine but its the one con I noticed.
This computer was not able to be set up and had an inherent problem. We had to send back for full refund.
Worst computer I’ve used. Screen dead after one month. Battery isn’t lasting long. Freezes and input output very slow.
I am a life-long fan of all things Apple.  That being said, after using this laptop for a little over a month, I am still impressed with how awesome this laptop is!  The battery life alone leaves me in awe.  I bought this laptop to use as an online student.  Starting with the battery fully charged, I am easily able to complete all of my online coursework and have plenty of battery power left to stream a movie or two afterwards.  I actually purchased my MacBook Air M1 laptop directly from Apple so I would get the student discount.  I did choose to upgrade my RAM to the 16 GB for an additional $180, and that did cause delivery to take a little longer.  Totally worth it though!  I have not done anything yet on this laptop to really stress-test it, but I have had multiple webpages in the browser, and multiple documents open in Word and PDF docs open with iBooks and Preview.  I have had no problems at all switching between open web sites, apps, or docs.  The only time I started to notice any hint of a problem, it turns out it was because we lost power and therefore our home WiFi was temporarily unavailable, so it had nothing to do with the laptop.While it is a minor inconvenience that Netflix is not available for download thru the app store at this time (Oct 2021), it is easy enough to access their streaming service thru the browser.  The built in speakers are plenty loud enough, but it is quite easy to use your AirPods if you prefer.I highly recommend this MacBook Air M1 to anyone, especially students, looking for a laptop that has a battery that will actually keep up with them all day long without constantly needing to find a power outlet.
M1 chipset does not support two monitors. Not sure why Apple would do this! And won’t except returns after 14 days.
I love the screen quality even tho it’s not touch screen I love it and it’s so easy to use and perfect for all my classes it’s super light and portable
I've owned this laptop for a year and a half, and felt compelled to take time out of my frantic day to note that I really think this computer is a giant step backward for the Macbook Air model and for Macintosh as a brand compared to my old 2013 Macbook Air running Yosemite.The lack of a mag-safe connection for the charger is really unforgivable, and this computer has wound up on the floor so frequently that I now have placed the dog bed where the laptop is likely to land.  The keys are beginning to stick.  The screen is beautiful, but gives me a terrible headache.  The memory pressure issue with the M1 is also a real problem in Safari, which locks up about every three weeks if you have a lot of windows open-- and it take a LONG time to force quit safely and recover lost work.  The laptop is also too big-- that extra inch or so of width really makes a difference.  The loss of practical functionality in iTunes is really disappointing, iMovie and Garage band have become much, MUCH harder to use in Big Sur as well, and Apple's insistence on trying to force me into using the kloud is both intensely irritating and very dangerous for my business, where confidentiality is absolutely critical.It is true that the processing speed for offline tasks is impressive-- my music projects do sound much better-- and photo and video editing is great.But the M1's speed is not enough of a reason for me to bond with this computer.  As the months have rolled by, honestly, I've come to kind of hate it.  I'm looking forward to refurbishing my old Macbook Air, and I'm thinking this may be the last Apple product that I buy, even though I can't think of a suitable alternative.I am a 64-year old professional health care provider who has been in IT since the early 1980s, and while it's true that I have generally been very unhappy with how gratuitously awful the end-user interface of most tech products have become over the last quarter century, there are some computers that I have actually liked-- my old Macbook Air was definitely one of them.  This is definitely not.
I'm new to Macbooks, having used Windows my whole life. I chose this for going back to school because I knew it would last longer and not get buggy like Windows always does. While the transition was a bit rocky at first, now that I somewhat know what I'm doing, I absolutely love this computer! It's small and lightweight, but still feel solid in your hands. The processor is incredibly fast as well as the load up time. I can get signed in and have my notes up in seconds (literally, no joke!), something I could never do with a Windows laptop (I should mention that I bought my computer directly from Apple and upgraded to the 16BG RAM and more storage, which helps immensely with load up time). For those that say the camera is bad- I don't think so. Is it the most amazing camera ever? No, but if you really need higher camera quality for your job, then you should probably go with a Macbook Pro instead of Air. For a Zoom meeting it works just fine. The price is obviously higher than many laptops- that's why I've never used Mac until now- but just think of it as an investment. I know I'll be able to use this for years to come!If you are looking for an efficient, reliable laptop with great performance, look no further!
I bought my Macbook Pro in 2013 which makes it 8 years old. It's still going strong. I did have to replace the battery a few years back. I did it myself, bit of a pain as Apple locks their stuff down pretty well. It looks like Apple will drop support for this late 2012 model next year. That's when I'll get a new one. Not bad for close to 10 years for one machine. About a hundred bucks a year.
Before I begin, I’d like to clarify that I purchased this MacBook on Apple.com.I was kind of reluctant at first to purchase a MacBook due to the expensive pricing. But it was heard that apple products are long lasting and really good quality. I’ve had. Chromebook for 3 years, and the quality is not amazing. I’ve had to bring it for repair multiple times. It also shut down randomly. But not with this MacBook.The MacBook is soo beautiful, and sleek. The rose gold color is so elegant, and the keys are amazing. At the top right hand corner there is a small button that enables Touch ID which is so convenient and easy to work.By just saying “hey, Siri” my automated assistant is summoned and will help me with whatever I need. It comes with so many apps. And so many ways to customize your MacBook.I changed my profile photo, set a quote on my Lock Screen, changed my wallpapers, made widgets, changed my highlight color, accent colors and much much more.It’s so convenient for me to have my zooms open in one browser and the “pages” app open in another so I can take notes while my teachers gives lessons.As shown in the pictures, if you update your MacBook with Big Sur, you can download “Widgetsmith” and customize widgets! My entire MacBook’s aesthetic is so elegant and I just love it. Comparing this to laptops like HP and Dell, as well as Google, there are limited ways you can customize your laptop to your liking.I asked a couple of friends and family members who have MacBooks, and they have had them for 5+ years, without having to take their MacBooks for repair. I am hoping this will be my case as well.I can now message anyone from the messages app and the mail app.The camera quality is great too! It’s touched up my appearance with zoom and Google meet. and I’ve heard if you want a MacBook to edit, the pro is the way to go because the storage is bigger.The battery life is so great too! I’ve used it for 6+ hours starting at 9am to 4:30 pm. It started at 45 percent and it only went down to 30!!!Buying a MacBook will not water your money! I am loving every second of my use!!! Thank you Apple!!! 💜
This Product is a very tiny device. No power button and lots of confusion navigating the system itself. Very expensive too. Not Good.
Had scratches all over the cover of it when it arrived. Sent it back for a refund.
I didn't like this product at all. It asked for a fingerprint and credit card number.
I got this MacBook Air for work, because my personal laptop is a 2019 Razer Blade, and while thin, it’s heavy and runs hot…like gaming laptops do.I decided to get a MacBook Air M1 256g for a work laptop, and had no real expectations for it. I’ve been very impressed.The quality is what you’d expect from Apple, sturdy construction, I love the keyboard, the display is solid and shows a depth that my other laptops never have. It has handled everything I’ve thrown at it, zooms, huge files of client contracts, browsing of course, I haven’t ever noticed it throttling due to a lack of a fan.It’s operating system is very user friendly too, some tasks that are a bit more difficult in a PC are astonishingly easy. Honestly, I haven’t even touched the Razer Blade in a few months, I will always have an apple laptop from here on out.
fits and protects my new Apple Air.
My son loved his Apple laptop while it worked. The screen has cracked twice. As we can see from the image, it cracks from the top middle where Apple put the camera. My son used the laptop a lot, but he did not mistreat his laptop. I generally do favor Apple products. Apple already repaired this once. I paid nothing for that repair. However, it has now failed twice for the same issue. I feel this is a serious engineering defect. I likely will take it to Apple so they can diagnose it. I don't particularly care if I get the laptop back or not at this point since I suspect it may break again within six months. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the Apple Macbook Air due to this defect. I do expect a laptop to last at least 2 or 3 years. Apple normally makes great products and I hold Apple in high esteem. This product unfortunately is not one of them. Not all of the Apple laptops will face this issue. But if you search the web you will find others who have experienced this same problem. I am hoping Apple stress tests newer versions of their laptops to address this issue in the future. Apple may need to modify the camera assembly or display assembly. Or relocate the camera to a different location like the corner of the display.
Not a good computer
The MacBook Air is a great purchase for a laptop. It has many new features that will be helpful for school and work. The laptop is affordable, portable, and has the new M1 chip. The way the laptop is affordable is because you will be able to pay for it monthly so you will not spend all your money at once. You will also be getting what you pay for with its latest features. It is also portable because it is light weight and slim. This will help you carry it anywhere you need to and will be very helpful if you go to college, since you will be carrying from class to class. Lastly, it has a new M1 processing chip. This M1 chip makes it better than any past MacBooks, it keeps you laptop running smooth and fast, it also gives you long battery life. I really do recommend you purchase the MacBook Air, it is worth buying.
I have both an iPad and iPhone so I thought is would be make sense to have a Mac so everything is in one ecosystem, as it were.  To some extent this has indeed proved true and useful.  I am coming from a Surface Pro 7.  The Mac Air's battery life is much less than advertised.  The claim is around 10 hours, I doubt I get 5, and I am mostly doing internet browsing and Word stuff.  Battery life from fully charged was about 1 hour while on Zoom.  The battery life of the Surface is better.  Word for Mac is a little different than Word for a PC, but the differences are minor and manageable.  But documents open more slowly on the Mac, and mine has the M1 chip.  On the Surface, documents usually open immediately.  On the Mac it might take 5 seconds, not an eternity, but a little annoying.  The Surface boots up much faster than the Mac.  I have a DVD with a number of workouts on it.  I could not get any individual workouts to open using the Mac's native software.  So I downloaded VLC.  It works fine on the Mac, but takes a long time to open, about a minute.  This seems to be true of any software not downloaded from the App store, including Firefox.  There do not appear to be Mac apps for either.  On the other hand, the Mac has a better screen than the Surface.  While the Surface is quite a good laptop, it is a marginal tablet, and I almost never use it as a tablet.  When I am not sitting at a desk, I prefer the Mac because the two parts cannot come apart as can happen on a Surface.  The new Mac keyboard works great, maybe a tie with the Surface.  So a mixed bag.  As I mentioned, I like having everything in one ecosystem, so likely that is enough of a benefit to keep the Mac.  I am mulling over upgrading to the MacBook Pro 13 because of its bigger battery, but don't know if I want to spend the extra money.
This was the best and I'm not even a fan of apple products. Now I'm getting a Apple Iphone!
Never had trouble with a Mac before.  But they refunded my money.
wow
I absolutely love my new MacBook.  When it arrived I answered a few questions, connected it to my WiFi and off I went.  It has been a buttery smooth experience.  Keyboards are one of those things that are dependent on user preferences, but for me it's the best feeling keyboard I have ever owned.  Many professional reviewers agree it's terrific. The multi-touch pad is brilliant, and now that I know the many different combinations of fingers and movements I zip around getting work done.  For example a two-finger swipe right goes back to the previous web page, no need to hit that back button.  It is also custom configurable to your touchpad needs. What I appreciate most is the total cost of ownership value.  I bought Final Cut Pro X when it came out 10 years ago yet there was no charge to get the latest version downloaded from the App Store. It does everything I need without an ongoing subscription fee like others have.  I still can't get used to how fast it works, it took me an hour to render a video on my old Mac but this MacBook did it in just a few minutes.  And it's cool and quiet! I'm using a huge 70" 4K monitor as my secondary monitor.  Battery life is ridiculous.  I plug it in every 2 or 3 days depending on my workload, which is several hours per day.  I think the web camera is fine for me and many notebooks use this same 720p size.  I join one Zoom conference per week, so it doesn't really matter. The one thing I hope gets updated with the next release are the ports.  I'm using a hub because it only has two thunderbolt ports. I recommend this notebook to all my friends and family.
Gave me a MacBook that was locked no way of getting in
Don’t buy stop letting me login in couldn’t reboot either
I love Linux, i can tolerate windows, usually don't like Mac. It's fine folks like what they like for me, Linux gives the most choice is extensible, and runs so fast on even older hardware, you get infinite support you don't get harassed to use cortana, siri, candy crush itunes etc etc.  Mac usually they push you so hard in this echo system for a lot of stuff i really don't like. it used to be just getting music out of itunes was a pain.well here we are in 2021. I mainly work on linux these days, and wanted a unix style mac because working remote i just needed something with microsoft office, i need that. i am not doing windows development these days. I know there is wsl but there are trade offs on windows. not with mac --  for my use case, so i tried it... gave it another shot really. My timing was seemingly really good. these computer are fantastic. You know what i hate about laptops. when they are 150 degrees melting your nuts and it sounds like you have a jet pack on. I hate that i really do. All of my laptops do this. The mac M1 I am pleased to report doesn't. Screw performance i mean that's great here, but the quiet and note heat that's the feature.This is coming from someone that doesn't want to like Apple. They outsource all these jobs, their stuff is over priced right? I'm not so  sure about the price here. You can buy a mac pro 13 inch that's faster than an i9 for 1500 (if you get 16gb), and the battery is amazing, no heat, no fan, the sound is great, the screen is great, the keyboard is great, it's not a lenovo, but other than that it's about as good as you can get. This machine is so well thought out. I got the pro, the reason i take a lot of calls and wanted the slightly better sound, and boosted battery,but if you don't need that you can just get the air which doesn't have the horrible touch bar. Don't get me wrong. the touch bar would be fine IN ADDITION to normal keys. that's where they went wrong here they got greedy. I digress. The only other issue i see here is the connectivity sucks. It needs ports on both sides and at least 2x ports.All these reviews are usually full of crap. It's just people getting free hardware and writing reviews so they can take a tax deduction, or they are sort marketing. This time it's true. This architecture is a significant advance especially in the laptop space. I 'm not sure if this will translate to a desktop-- risc vs cisc isn't new it been going on for decades, but  for laptops, this is a quantum leap. I don't see any reason for the work i'm doing to use a desktop computer a this point. i have complete portability, i can take calls (amazing calls), work on ms office, general development (vscode, all the jetbrains stuff, docker etc)... i mean for a lot of system stuff i'll still use I'd still use linux, but for work this is a great way to go. What a great product. It really really is. This i as strong of an endorsement i can give if you just need to be productive. After 8 months of hell no more fumbeling around with TPM chips, mics, no being able to share my screen, pleading with my computer to use the right audio device. I like it better than any other laptop i have ever had by far.This thing is really just that good. I've been i this industry for a long time. There are going to have to be some changes in competitors product lines, if Apple continues to maintain this price point and deliver a product of this caliber. I have no question this one is going to eat market share fast. I'd imagine there will be a strong response fro Intel, amd and the software companies.  It's difficult to justify purchasing any other laptop at this moment. I mean just get the air for 1200, just get the extra ram. maybe 500 gb. That's all most people are going to need. Who cares if they release better ones in 6 months. they always do they'll probably cost too much. this is all you need.
Apple is not standing behind this product.  We bought this laptop in 12/2020.  We activated it but my husband changed his mind.  It sat in our office for 1 1/2 years  We just plugged it in for my granddaughter for college and it won't charge.  Apple wants $428 to fix with only 90 day warrantee.  It has no trade in value and was never hooked up to the internet.  So sadI have a much older MacBook Air that has been fine.
Nice Laptop
Mac is completely dead.
The product came damage
Not very user friendly not in love with it
Report abuse
Product was broken
It wouldn’t even turn on
This M1 is such a leap ahead for Apple. It has great battery life, no heat, and is fast and versatile. I  ordered the 512 model, but as a casual user, I don’t know if I will ever use all that memory. I think that many people could order the 256 base model, and save some bucks. An external drive is cheaper than built in memory. The fingerprint sensor is wonderful!
I encourage people who have had a bad taste left in their mouth by older (Intel) MacBooks, like myself, at least try out an M1 machine in person and see the difference.Compared to my older Core i5 MacBook: no more ridiculous heat and fan noise, no hit on performance with a bunch of apps open, and I could continue this list but *oh my god the battery.* I will watch a few YouTube videos, listen to music, edit some documents then check the battery percentage... to see it has gone down at most a handful of %, on pretty high brightness. It's a remarkable accomplishment that will surely change the way I use and transport my laptop. App compatibility has not been an issue for me at all, but it's worth I do not use any niche developer / engineering tools.
Unable to remake the installation system
i believe i bought this in march, it’s currently may. when i got it the box wasn’t damaged or anything. but the caps lock button and space bar malfunction. sometimes i have to press them multiple times for them to work.
The move to M1 has made this model an instant classic. If you like MacOS and need a daily driver person or light-load professional laptop, just buy it.Pros:Huge jump in battery life over competitors and previous generationExcellent performance with no fan noise and no heatGreat value for priceLight weight, perfect industrial designGreat displayCons:Higher refresh rate (120hz+) would be niceWebcam is outdated
Purchased as a replacement upgrade for older MacBook. Very happy with screen and battery life. We also own MacBook PRO and one other Mac Air so we're picky! Highly recommended.
Beware:  reliability and customer support is gone.  I bought a MacBook Air about 2 years ago. From the beginning, it malfunctioned, intermittently failing to allow me to access any other apps besides the one I was using.  I worked with numerous Apple technicians who also witnessed the problem.  After hours and hours over months of patiently working with them, I was told we’d try a complete replacement of the OS and if that didn’t work, I’d get a replacement. When it didn’t, I was told I’d now have to take disk images and record dates and times it failed. They’d have the “engineers” get involved.  “The engineers” for one faulty laptop after I’d been patient for two years doing everything they asked, and they witnessed the problem.  Two years, hours upon hours of my life and a false commitment to make it right. I’ve been a Mac user for decades.  No longer.  Given the premium price + AppleCare, I feel cheated and so disappointed.  I’ll be looking for a new non-Apple laptop.
Here’s my in-depth review of the M1 MacBook Air. (Don’t get confused by the color Amazon said on top, it’s a gold color, and bought it off Best Buy).ProcessorThis thing has a blazing-fast M1 system on a chip @3.2 GHz. The bootup times are so short and apps launch instantly. Also apps are incredibly smooth.DisplayThis has a Retina display. It’s the best laptop display. YouTube videos come to life. If you zoom in on this Mac’s screen the pixels are “so small and so close together, that the human eye can’t even distinguish them, so type looks razor sharp”. That’s the moral of the iPad 3rd Gen, guys!Audio and MicrophoneIn short terms, the audio and microphone audio are both REALLY clear. I’m pretty sure these are stereo speakers.DescriptionOverall the best notebook we ever had. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
I couldn't ask for more from a $900-1000 laptop.  The trackpad, the keyboard, the screen, the performance, the battery life, all great 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
The only computers I've ever owned have been Macs, starting with a Mac SE in 1987. This is the first time I've bought one that has mainly made me angry.I quickly discovered that I couldn't plug it into my printer because it doesn't have a USB port, so I had to buy a USB-C to USB adapter: $19.I also can't charge it using any of the chargers around my house from my old MacBooks or my husband's MacBook, so in order to have an extra charger, I had to pay $49. When it arrived, I realized it didn't come with a cord. Another order; another $19.And Apple is no longer using MagSafe connectors, so if you accidentally hit the cord with your foot or whatever, the cord doesn't just pop out of the computer. Instead, it drags your computer with it. Yesterday, just a month after getting my expensive new computer, I dragged it to the floor and broke the screen. It'll cost me $500 to get it fixed, if I don't decide to throw it into a dumpster.I now officially hate Apple. What's especially annoying is that they've successfully addicted me to their products, and I know I'm not going to change brands at this point in my life, so I'm going to keep having to put up with this kind of crap from Apple, plus how they're always trying to invade my privacy and force me to use iCloud and how their software now tries to make way too many decisions for me.I'm writing this review on my old 2015 MacBook Air and, even though it's slower than the new MacBook and the display is smaller and not as nice, I'm wondering if I really want to fix my new MacBook.
I have had this MacBook Air in the gold color for a few months now. This is actually my very first MacBook. I absolutely LOVE it. First of all, it is gorgeous. I am a sucker for cute packaging or a cute product, and this laptop is just stunning. I have never seen a beautiful laptop until I got this.The performance is amazing as well. Super long battery life; I rarely have to charge it. Super thin. Never gets hot. Super fast. The 4k performance is beautiful. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. Definitely worth the price.  I looked at all of the MacBooks in person before buying, and the Air is just stunning with its thin design. Did not like the looks of the Pro models!
The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip is overall amazing! It’s definitely worth the money! The all-new chipset has turned the Air lineup into a beast! My only complaint is the camera. Apple has stuck to the same 720p camera and claiming the neural engine makes it better? I’m not convinced it’s any better, and it’s really a disappointment compared to other notebooks in its class. Also, the inability to adjust the keyboard brightness from the keyboard. It’s adjustable from the settings and easily accessible… but it’s just an inconvenience. It’s a petty complaint but for the money, this should be standard (it previously was on older models). Aside from that, this notebook is amazing! Lightning fast and the best battery life I’ve ever seen! Overall, if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and you’re looking for an amazing laptop with all day battery life - this is the one for you!
Purchased this laptop in November (half a year ago) but did not really start using until the spring semester (end of January). About a month ago, I randomly opened my laptop to find colored lines across the screen. No damage to the phone as most my classes were remote and I was using my computer on my desk. It ended up going away on its own after shutting it down for 2 hours, but lines continue to reappear every few days or so then disappear after I let it rest. I looked it up online and it seems to be a hardware issue but I do not know how to fix this since I did not cause the problem. Never installed anything additional on my laptop besides google chrome and R software for research. Do not go through Amazon to purchase mac products.
The laptop seems fine but the box and laptop and adapter cord wreaked of mold. I would have returned it, but needed a computer immediately for work.
This happened to my buddy Eric
I'm a big techie and after seeing all the benchmarks had to get the M1. It's truly a game changing processor. My wife and I love this laptop. There's a slight adjustment as I'm a lifelong Windows user but MacOS is intuitive enough that it's not too bad. I tried to make the switch with Safari but it lacks profiles so I'm on the Brave browser. Brave works great and have had no issues so far. I also use signal and Bitwarden and both work fine.Apple really knocked the ball out of the park with this machine. The one true con is the crappy webcam. Aside from that this is the best laptop money can buy on the market hands down.
First, I will say I bought this at an Apple store, not on Amazon.  So this is a review of the product.  For many years, I have found Apple products to be overrated and overpriced.  That includes this product.  For example, as others have stated - no good ports (you need to buy all kinds of attachments), no touchscreen, etc.  And, of course, there are compatibility issues with anything not made by Apple.  But my biggest beef is that it is not reliable.  I recently downloaded Monterey - and am having all kinds of problems.  I find all these 5 star reviews hard to believe.
I've been using this laptop for the past month and is working out great! I love the battery life, i've only charged it 4 times😜.

amazing
I traded in my previous MacBook Air for the current version with the M1 chip. I have only had it for four days and all I can say is wow! I didn't think I would notice much of a difference, but I am very impressed with the speed and the battery life of this new edition. I mainly use my laptop for emailing, paying bills, and web browsing, and I purchased this model instead of the Pro because I don't edit or shoot videos. This model is perfect for my needs.
If you purchase the MacBook Air with the M1 chip YOU WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RUN WINDOWS ALONG WITH MAC OS!  If your buying specifically to just use the Mac OS & don’t have a problem not being able to run Windows or any program that runs on Windows, then this system is a good Apple product.  If you are like myself (or want the option like you SHOULD JUST HAVE as has always been offered in the past with processors before the M1 and run Windows on a partitioned drive either with MAC OS, or boot up into Windows instead, the M1 chip now takes that ability to do so away!  The MacBook Air itself with the M1 chip now that they’ve finally incorporated the ability to run iPhone apps on it is in itself a huge breakthrough.  That was overall my biggest frustration with using MacBooks by a long shot.  And it seems they’ve fixed that now, so on one end impressive if your simply not needing Windows or anything that runs in the Windows environment of course.
Brought this from apple directlyDisplay started showing Vertical stripes within 20 days of purchaseAnd yes not in stock for replacementApple was helpful in refunding the moneyI would recommend to go for 512 GM ssd256 GB only gives you to 140 Gb odd space to work with
Absolutely incredible. Apple has outdone themselves with this new M1 chip. If you are Windows user looking for a new laptop, and you are okay with trying out macOS, I would say this purchase is a no-brainer.
Full disclosure, bought from Best Buy open box for a much better price and convenient same day pick up.Shouldn't surprise anyone, build quality is top of the line, feels ultra premium, track pad, screen and keyboard are perfect. Screen is actually amazing, makes a huge different coming from even an IPS windows laptop. Fanless is truly fantastic, laptop stays cool with demanding tasks while sipping battery. I sat there for 5 hours doing some serious writing and safari browsing, and barely lost ~20%. I'd imagine you could get a couple days with casual/moderate use.This laptop solves all the problems of the previous Air's, it doesn't get super hot and the fans kick on obnoxiously loud. Performance is top notch, and the only real downfall is the lack luster webcam, but I'm not knocking off a star because every laptop has at least one compromise. This is a compelling package for the price, especially if you get more than 3 years out of it which is very doable. Overall was very impressed with this machine coming from a Ryzen 3500u Windows laptop.
okay so, pretty great laptop. it doesn’t overheat, the camera is better than my previous macbook, and it runs pretty well. the only problem i have is that extensions like chrome keep crashing. as a student using google meet and zoom for 7 hours a day i really can’t be crashing in the middle of a class. i’m not big on tech, so i’m not that picky, but i hope this problem sorts itself out.
This is our second Macbook Air.  The first one lasted nearly 5 years and was a rock-solid laptop. The new m1 machines are garbage. Do some research on the internet. The screens break and Apple denies there is a problem.  We have had this one for about 8 months and the screen just broke a second time.  I've paid $200 for Apple care and $100 twice to replace a screen.  We did NOTHING to the screen. no signs of abuse, a bump, a scratch, NOTHING. just open one day and the screen is black and pixelated. The break is internal. When its not broken, its a great computer.  Just be ready to buy it several times over replacing the screen.mIf you are already a victim, there are law firms taking cases.  Apple ought to step up and just deal with the defect.  Forcing customers that have been loyal to the brand to join in a class action suit in order to deal with the know and ongoing problem is awful.  Too bad they are so big they just don't care.
Upgraded from Mid 2015 base Macbook Air. This thing is like 100x faster. It is amazing. I got used to the USB-C and bought a little hub that makes it a non issue. Actually like it better since USB C is faster. Battery life on my old MacBook was amazing. This one is literally at least double that. Pro tip do not use chrome on any Mac or MacBook it is energy and efficient and will kill your battery (took me a while to learn this). Webcam is only bad part but all Macbooks have substandard webcams compared to iPhones. I got the base model and do NOT regret it one bet- I saved a ton of money on one less core and I do NOT notice a difference (heard its 10% or less). This thing is razor thin!
Granted I'm coming off a MBP 8/500 dual-core i5, but this thing is read-my-mind fast.  I keep quitting apps out of habit when you just don't need to.  Keyboard is back to pre-butterfly goodness, sound is great, and with a dock like the Anker 7-in-1 you will not mind the port count.  GarageBand and iMovie never miss a beat.  On geekbench, these new M1 units are surpassed only by the xeon Mac & iMac Pros and the 8-core i9 iMac.  Same no-go apps as Catalina, so no real surprises.  Can't wait for more universal binary apps, it'll only get better.
Yes there are bezels but honestly who cares?  This package delivers an extremely strong value as someone who spends most of their time in a browser, working on excel and word.  Chrome has not posed any issues so far with many extensions and two profiles running simultaneously as of the time of writing mid december.  8gb of ram is more than enough to run a multitude of apps thanks to apple's strong os optimization.This one is a keeper, I've been trying out macbooks for awhile and was always unhappy with something. Don't get me started with the battery life, it is so good that I spend most of my time off the charger.Most average joes looking for a daily driver or work from home computer will be satisfied with this.  As long as apple continues to support the first gen of desktop silicon for a long time like everything else, then I have no doubt this will last for a long time.
Yup.  This M1 MacBook Air is everything the online reviewers said it was--amazingly fast, agile, and smart.  It blows away all earlier MacBook Airs as well as most other laptops on the market.  I'm not much of a tech nerd, so the specs and numbers don't mean much to me.  I'm a writer.  So I appreciate the feel, ease, and portability of the machine.  Plus, I'm delighted with the keyboard--heads and tails better than the faulty "butterfly" keyboard on my old 2017 Air.  All in all, this is a great small laptop.  Solid, but light.  Lightning fast and nimble.  It is a great step up from the older Intel machines.  And I'm not in the least bothered that the external design is the same as the older models.  It's a classic and fully functional shape, so why change?  Well done, Apple.
I run 11ish, an investment website and channel on youtube. I was hesitant about whether this laptop will handle video editing or not since I came from a 2016 macbook pro, but this has outperformed it through and through! Fast and reliable. The only problem I ran into was actually migrating past iMovie content over
Best one I had ever
Disclaimer: purchased a special order 16GB/512GB directly from AppleUsage: general purpose web browsing, office work, programming in Python, casual photo editingBattery: excellent. I can go the entire day without charging with my screen brightness turned up all the way up.Responsiveness: quick to do what I want it to do.M1 compatibility: lots of apps are jumping to support M1 natively; Rosetta does the job and I have no complaintsKeyboard: good typing feel
GREAT!!! Came on time!!!
No complains so far. Very fast and performs great. I had a 2020 March version of MacBook Pro and I think this November release is better.  Battery life is much better and also, audio and video seem improved compare to older release.
Apple makes an incredible product. But their contempt for the customer knows no end. This is especially exemplified by the reduction of ports to only two on the MacBook Aires and even some Powerbooks. And EVERYTHING is put into those two. The separate power port is gone. The separate video out port is gone. In some cases, even the audio out port is gone. All they leave you with is two USB ports which they expect you to use for everything. For a lot of people, like myself, multiple ports are needed for constant use. They are needed for external hard drives (especially for file backup where you don't want to use the Apple Cloud which is susceptible to NSA snooping), external DVD and CD burners, special printers that do NOT work with Bluetooth, special mice for people like myself with handicaps that make trackpads difficult, drawing pads, etc. etc. etc. And don't tell me to just get an external hub. I have tried them all and NONE of them provide proper power to external tools that need it. Plus they frequently get hotter than a firecracker. In summation, Apple needs to start giving consideration to the Customer's needs and not just to some fancy "updated" technology. Bluetooth does not work dependably and is a real pain most of the time and is not available for all external tools. We NEED physical ports. Please put them back on the MacBooks, especially the "Aires". And stop taking them off of the Mac Cubes. The last one I bought had no audio port causing extreme problems with my video production work. PLEASE APPLE, BRING BACK THE PORTS. Otherwise I may be forced, God forbid, to go back to Microsoft computers.
I was using a 2015 MacBook Pro for doing video editing for my church, and when I saw the specs on the M1 based MacBook Pro, I upgraded for faster processing.  My existing system has an Apple monitor, wi-fi keyboard and mouse, and a WD 3 TB external drive.The two USB-C ports on the new MacBook Pro are inadequate!  I also bought a new 27" LG monitor because I couldn't figure out how to use the old monitor with the new computer.  The LG monitor has 4 USB-C ports on the back, so I assumed would give me enough connections for my devices.  WRONG!!!!!Only one of the LG ports is Lighting compatible, so I had to use it to connect and power the laptop.  I had to buy a USB-C to Displayport adapter, plus a Displayport to Firewire adapter to connect my external drive, but this wasn't supported over the monitor's USB-C ports, it had to be connected to the remaining Lightening port on the laptop.  This consumed all the easily accessible ports!Then I had to buy a USB-C to USB3 adapter to connect my camera and other devices to the computer.  All behind the monitor.  It's a royal pain!  I've got it working, but I'm unhappy with the cludge.  I don't understand why Apple put together such a capable laptop with so limited connection capabilities.  I'm going to be d*****g with this terrible configuration for years.On the positive side, their claims of faster processing are true.  I can put together a church video, then export it to a file in 1/2 the time as my old laptop.  Even the upload speeds to YouTube seem to be faster.
Junk.  For $1000, I'm gonna need a little more than a 256GB ssd that can't ever be upgraded or replaced because it's soldered to the MB.  When the SSD goes, the whole thing is worthless.  Or inversely, if the MB dies, you can't remove the drive to get your data.  It's like they are trying to fill up landfills with garbage on purpose.
My favorite thing about this new macbook is the ability to listen to music beautifully at the first level of volume. At max volume a theater can hear it.
Awesome macbook
I've tried several wireless mouse and flash drive neither will connect to device.
Owned a 2016 MacBook Air that had display issues from the get-go, but Apple said it might be okay if I was super careful handling it.  I couldn’t go without a laptop for 2 weeks so decided to risk it.  After a couple yrs of being super careful the display became distorted after just a slight bump, and after the warranty period of course.  Used it hooked up to the TV only for about a year, but as that was difficult in itself (overheating, prevented sleep function, etc), had to change course.  Didn’t wanna pay $550 for a new display, so…… bought the M1 2020 MacBook Air instead. Seemed to be operating well until 8 months in, when I wasn’t even anywhere near it and the display went totally out.  Wouldn’t turn on after repeated powering down so called Apple.  They had me power on with that shift-control for 10 secs and it went on again. However, considering my experience with my last laptop took no chances and brought it in to Apple.They ran diagnostics and found that the ambient light sensor wasn’t working.  That’s what automatically dims and brightens the screen when going into dark or bright places, in case you, like I, didn’t really know what it did.  Had never dropped this or mishandled it in any way.Sent in my laptop for repair and it’s now been more than a week without and they’re still “diagnosing” it.  Luckily my old laptop is still semi-functional if I hook it up to my TV.  And I still had a few months left in the warranty.  But what if it didn’t and I didn’t have the old one still functional?Two times in a row MacBook Air with serious display issues in the last 5 yrs, with no accidental damage from me. Aside from this, has superior speed and processing power, doesn’t overheat, but still takes 20-30 sec to power up and the touchpad functionality and the feel of both it and the keyboard are terrible when compared to the 2012 I used to have.If you buy an Apple laptop now Apple care plus is almost mandatory.  Will have to seriously consider going back to Windows for my next laptop.
I gave my wife this new MacBook Air as a gift 3 months ago. She is very careful with it. She opens it last night and the screen is garbled. There's a hairline crack in it leading from the left edge. It wasn't dropped. It wasn't pressed on, sat on, or kept under books. In other words it was NORMAL use when the damn thing stopped working.We took it to Apple store and they want $400+ to fix it. It's 3 months old! The guy says the display is flimsy and subject to crack. I go online to see if he is telling the truth... found a LOT of hits of others complaining about how easily the screen cracks.I'm a big Apple fan but am disappointed and outraged that Apple would sell a product with such a design flaw and expect users to "buy Apple Care" so that they pay "less when it breaks"... even under NORMAL use.Save your money, buy and older model or get an iPad which ironically can take a beating by a 12 year old gamer without fail!
I am one of the thousands that have come back to their laptop the next day only to find black vertical lines.  This has happened twice (I bought the computer in August 2021) .  Apple fixed the screen the first time, but are now asking for 514 dollars, claiming that I damanged the screen.  I did not!  This problem is so common there are two class action lawsuits that have been filed against Apple.  They purposely sold a computer that they knew would develop cracks with opening or closing it.
Apple USED to make great computers... Past tense! I've used them for many (almost 20) years but recently bought this computer in December and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed. How the mighty have fallen!I was always the biggest Apple supporter. I have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself. From the Apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros, macbook airs and phones. I defended them against the Apple haters and always had their backs. I thought I was going to be Apple for life. I even own many shares of their stock, which I will be dumping soon because I see the writing on the wall. I could tell something was up with them as Apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesn't move. It's the biggest slug of a stock. I now think I have stumbled upon the reason why.If you google the recent complaints about Apple you will see. Apple does not have the great customer service they once had. I was mistaken to think they did. They have also started cheaping out... big time. The result? Products that don't last. Couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and I'm sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here... Selling all of my $AAPL stock ASAP stat.Warning, do not buy this computer! Apple's quality has gone wayyy downhill.The MacBook Air cords are absolutely horrendous! I am on my third Apple cord in less than 6 months. I brought the product to an Apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me. He told me I must be doing something wrong. Nothing has changed about my usage of their products. I've always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old. Think years and years. Not months. So you'd think if I was the problem like this guy tried to say I was, I'd be going through computer cords right and left, right? Well I haven't. And looking up my account would prove that. However, Apple doesn't care. They want to charge me for to replace their defective products anyway.Welcome to the new Apple where the customer is always WRONG.Then the guy doubled down and told me that he'd been working at the Apple store for 10 years and I'm the ONLY person who has ever had a problem with their cord. A simple google search has proved that to be completely false. Everybody complains about the quality of their cords. This must be huge business for them selling cords like this.So the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong. If you want to sign on for that, good luck. I hope you never run into a problem and see what I'm talking about but you'll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time. I am DONE! I work too hard for my money and they aren't the only computer show on the road. Lucky for me I speak PC too.Thanks for nothing Apple! Good job burning that bridge. You just lost a loyal customer over $19. Hope it was worth the extra $$$$. It's not the money Apple. It's the principle. I won't do business with companies who treat me like that, period. Peace out!
The M1 chip really is amazing. But it only lasted five days for me. Somehow mine managed to break after using a third party USB C hub. The screen wouldn’t turn on at all, and an Apple repair tech couldn’t figure it out after doing a few quick tests. Oh and then Apple said it would take a month to replace it with a new one.
Be aware the screen is extremely delicate and prone to break for no apparent reason. Apple won't acknowledge the design fault and now there is a class action law suite. Stay away from the AIR unless you enjoy expensive repair bills.
It amazes me how much praise Apple seems to be getting for an out dated design and user interface.  Where is the touch interface and pen input especially since it is supposed to run IPad apps?  Where is the flexibility of a 2 in 1 that we have had available for years?  Apple has basically given us a fast dinosaur with a pretty face.
Overall, I love it. However, with that said there are some serious cons to consider before purchasing.1. Terrible camera--super grainy. This is unfortunate for a time that the majority of us are working at home or are reliant on FT for communication.2. It's important to be mindful, and as most techs will admit, this is easily apple's worst M chip--it will only get better! In the meantime, however, this Mac is super fast!I use it for school, work, and casual browsing. If that's what you're looking for, I recommend it. If you're looking for the best of the best, wait until they fix this camera.
(Heads-up, this review will be lengthy, but I wanted to cover every aspect to make sure you make the right buying choice).The MacBook Air has always been known as a popular choice for college students over the years due to the lightweight, slim design and good battery life. One caveat that has always plagued the MacBook Air of year’s past was underwhelming performance due to underclocked, lower-powered processors (which were always reserved for the “Pro” line). That was why I always got a MacBook Pro in year’s past. This time around, when Apple announced the new M1 chip, I was curious, so I watched hours and hours of reviews and decided to pull the trigger on the new Air (the Air has the same chipset as the MacBook Pro, with the same GHz at 3.2, while saving $300). I am on a budget, but I also didn’t want to sacrifice performance, so I was a little nervous I was missing out by not getting the Pro, but thankfully I have not had to sacrifice a thing.I am a full-time digital design student, so my workflow can be demanding at times with running Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign, etc. I previously purchased a 2017 MacBook Pro and it was my daily driver until about mid-March when I made a grievous error and went out and purchased a Lenovo Yoga C940 with 16GB of Ram, Intel i7 Processor at a whopping price tag of $1500.00. Buyer’s remorse soon followed as the Yoga was plagued with overheating issues, thermal throttling and absolutely horrific battery life. The only thing that I liked was the speaker set-up and the 4K touch screen. Other than that, I was beyond disappointed. I sent it back, and went back to using my 2017 MacBook Pro, until I purchased this Air.So the pro’s:Fantastic battery life—I have a tough time killing the battery on this computer. It will easily last an entire day, and even longer if you aren’t totally hammering this thing with demanding apps like I do. It’s great to know you don’t have to always carry a charger with you everywhere (you can carry from class to class, the coffee shop and back home and it’ll still have battery to spare). A win in my book.Heat management and fanless design—I am super nit-picky about heat management and fan noise when it comes to laptops, which is why I always love the MacBooks and detest Windows (hence sending the Lenovo back).  The fact that this computer is fanless and manages to stay cool to the touch boggles my mind. I don’t have to worry about a computer than will get so hot that you can fry an egg on it, or annoying fans kicking on. I also like that I don’t have to worry about blocking any ventilation grills, since there is no fan. I can sit in bed with covers under this and not worry I’m blocking a fan exhaust.  Again, another win in my book.Slim design—at 2.8 pounds, and having a tapered design, you can throw this thing in a backpack and not feel like you’re lugging around a brick. I also liked the tapered design as it’s a little more ergonomic than my MacBook Pro that has some really sharp edges by the trackpad. It’s a nice change for someone that has to type up essays all of the time.Keyboard—gone are the butterfly mechanisms of MacBook’s past. One thing I really missed when I gave up my 2015 MacBook Pro was the keyboard! Thankfully with the new Air and Pro’s, you get the scissor switch mechanisms back, so my fingers don’t feel like they’re hitting bottom when typing for long periods of time.Trackpad—I love, love the force touch trackpad. I still believe Apple has one of the best trackpad designs of any laptop out there. Hands down. It’s smooth as butter.Performance—This is the little machine that could. It puts my 2017 Pro to shame. It also outperforms the Lenovo that was supposed to be top of the line, at a fraction of the cost. I can have multiple tabs in Safari open, Photoshop, Apple Music, Microsoft Word, and this doesn’t even break a sweat. I also like that I can do some light video editing on this. For most people—especially college students—this computer’s power should be more than sufficient. Keep in mind if you are a professional videographer or photographer, you might want to opt for the Pro as it does have a fan and can sustain heat management better in terms of thermal throttling. Again, that’s if you’re editing like multiple 4K videos on a daily basis, but for college students or the average Joe that may only need to do the occasional video project—no problem! This computer can handle it!Screen—It’s nice and bright, and the color accuracy is on point, which is important if you edit photos or videos in any capacity like I do.Speakers—I am a music junkie, and I have to constantly have music going when I’m working on school projects, and for such a thin and light laptop the speakers on this are actually pretty good. Good stereo separation and punchy. They could do with a little more bass, and when you max the volume it can get a little faded, but that’s to be expected for such small speaker drivers. I am more than pleased with them. They also work good for binge-watching shows on Netflix.The cons (there are few):The webcam—it’s a 720P webcam, and well, it looks like a 720P webcam. It’s a little grainy and washed out. It will do in a pinch, but you’d think in 2020 we’d get an upgrade on the webcam.The lack of ports—in true Apple fashion, the I/O is somewhat lacking. You have 2 thunderbolt 4 ports, of which you cannot plug in an external GPU, and are limited to one external monitor (this is a limit that Apple’s M1 system on a chip, not the thunderbolt ports, which I am sure will be resolved in future iterations). I would have liked to have seen at least one USB-A port for legacy things like flash drives, etc. But that’s just me being nit-picky.M1 chip running Intel apps—because Apple’s M1 chip runs on ARM and most apps are coded for Intel, there are many apps that have not been optimized to run the new Apple chip natively (like Adobe Creative Cloud). You might run into a few glitches and hick-ups while app developers are getting up to speed. So far, I haven’t really run into any issues, but there is that possibility. I am sure here soon it won’t be a problem. Again, it’s nit-picking.--To sum up: this MacBook Air is a winner. I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, and I would absolutely buy it again. You get the performance and the portability, while saving some $ by not buying the Pro line. I am very happy with this computer and think I might just have come as close as I can to the perfect laptop for my needs.Happy shopping!
Like thousands of other people, the screen started flickering after about 2 months. Then it went completly black. Apple store said my only option was pay over $400 to fix the screen. Apple call center said they can only take a complaint and my only option is to pay the money the store said to fix their defective product. Google to find out more. Don't by this defective product, Apple says it is not covered by its warranty because it is the customer fault. But, it is happening to 1000s of people and they know it is actually their fault.
Great out of the box, then slowly the battery life started decreasing, the constant hard reboots to get Safari back up and running, inexplicably running hot, and crashing more often than a Windows machine. Simply plugging in the power adapter is enough to crash the system followed by the necessary reboot.I firmly believe that Apple will eventually get the bugs will get worked out, but for now look elsewhere or wait for either the M1x or M2 processors that will hopefully have this operating smoothly.UPDATE: There are other emerging issues.In Safari, the keystrokes to italicize "Command+I" will randomly switch to opening up a new email message, and the keystrokes to convert text to LaTeX, "command+shift+L" now inexplicably opens the left panel. I am also coming into the known compatibility issue mentioned elsewhere.
Bought one directly from Apple. I was excited to see how nice it would be to use since I had recently moved over to using an iPhone and was impressed at how it had improved over the years. All the positive reviews and videos everywhere made this seem like a great product. Don’t be fooled. Please. This is one of the most disappointing and frustrating pieces of tech I’ve ever had the displeasure of getting to use. Never have I seen or used a computer that had so many options that you will never need. Missing options you should always have. And not be capable of preforming basic tasks without bugging out. To those saying this is one of the best computers you’ve ever used… have you ever used a computer before? Anytime within the last 10-15 years? I’m willing to bet not.
Good speed, but have several issues with printer both Scan & print. Also I am facing issue with external drive back up.  There is no inbuilt flash drive port.
This was the first Apple Laptop I've purchased. My entire life I was so excited to always purchase an Apple MacBook/MacBook Air because of the positive reviews. I tend to review most everything in the most positive light, but this is just horrible. I constantly come back to the laptop and it says "Please report unexpected shutdown to Apple." This has happened at least 8 times with no response from an Apple Technician. Then the camera quality for a 2020 Machine is something out of the 1990s. It's horrible, I look grainy and I bought this laptop for an MBA program. If you want to run many programs at once, even with upgrade RAM and Processor, you will hear what sounds like an airplane trying to take off CONSTANTLY. The. fan. does. not. shut. off. Sure it's portable, sure the "build" quality feels good in the hand. In terms of performance, spend the extra money and don't get this. I'm quite embarrassed I shelled out over $1k for this. Do as you wish, but this laptop is not worth the money and has pretty much ruined my desire to get any form of an Apple Laptop again.
Buyer beware! Like the MacBook Pro pictured here, the screen of the MacBook Air often cracks within a few weeks or months after purchase, entirely without any misuse. The design flaw seems to be the relative inflexibility of the screen's LCD panel.I ordered a MBA, then returned the package unopened after reading relevant articles on 9to5mac and the discussion thread on the Apple support site. With few exceptions, Apple refuses to make the repair under warranty. The user's cost of replacing the screen amounts to half the purchase price.
My 2018 MBA died (logic board).  It was 2-1/2 years old.  Apple quoted $500 to repair it.  The repair came with a 90 day warranty.  They told me that if I had purchased Apple Care, it would have been covered.  If I had purchased Apple Care on all of the Apple computers I've purchased over the past 25 years I could have bought 2-3 brand new MacBook Airs.  Used to be a fan of Apple.
What happens when you perfect a product? You can only go downhill. In 2015 Apple perfected the MacBook. Then, they ruined it.Everyone in 2015: It's great. A bit more battery life would be nice.Apple: We'll make it thinner, make the touchpad so big people hit it with their palms, remove the magnetic break-a-way power cable that everyone loves, replace all the ports with USB-C ports so people have to buy dongles, swap the keyboard for one that barely even functions, and hell (just to mess with everyone) let's lower the battery life.The 2020 does little to fix any of the issues. It's a crap product, but after Jobs died Tim Cook couldn't make changes because he'd basically be admitting he was wrong. And they need to keep changing things because otherwise it is only perfect and not "new" - Whoever decided this was the way to go should be working in an Amazon warehouse sorting returns.
First off I’m giving this one star just so you’ll read this honest review. I brought this Mac book and have been satisfied with functionality and speed but I’m giving 1 star because apple really nickel and dimes us as customers. The usb c cable that comes with the laptop is not even close to being one of the best on the market. I attempted to use it to power my elgato game capture card and the card would not read. Kept saying I need a usb3.0 to work. So I then used the cable that came with my Samsung external hard drive and bang it work immediately. I spent a lot of money on this laptop just to receive a weak cable with it. The cable is literally only good for charging and light duty file transfer which I guess is ok for most people. But for me it was not. Apple already doesn’t give us headphones anymore and they don’t even have the decency to give us a very good cable. 1star because for this price I could have built a computer or brought a prebuilt one. Last apple laptop I will ever buy. O and the camera sucks and there are no setting to adjust it.
Don't let the fanboys sway you, you're a beta tester with this laptop.  Lots of software doesn't function with it, I know, it didn't run of key programs I needed, also what does can be buggy at times.  If you're using this for work or real money is counting on its use DO NOT buy, simple as that.  Lots of things should have been better, the bezel in 2021 is thick.  The lack of ports is ridiculous.  If you planned to use windows, count that out.  If your a grandma using it to surf the web go for it.
This is one of the most expesive laptops and have not Microsoft pack.  Pages &numbers, is horrible to work in it.You need to buy the New Microsoft pack becasue it does not includying it and worse do not let dowlond due the M1 card, I do not find nothing good different neither in the camera with this new macbook air 2020.  At the least my last macbook air had inclided the Microsoft pack and was more easy to work.  The screen is not different neither with my old macbook, so I am vert disssapoinment, I bougth in January 2021 directly from the Apple website.
I've had mine less than 3 months and am unhappy and peeved off. While this is a pretty and nice laptop as well as light and easy to travel with. It LAGS and is SLOW. Every time I haven't opened my laptop an hour after I last opened it nothing happens with the screen and I am forced to hold the power button until it turns off and then on again, if I'm lucky it works the first time. and when you plug anything into it the computer FREEZES! (you also need to get an adapter because it doesn't take USB) Apple is once again charging way too much for a subpar product. If you're looking for fast and streamlined this is NOT the computer for you. Very disappointed and utterly annoyed.
Just as I bought a 2nd M1 Macbook Air... The first one, which I'm currently using to make this review, randomly freezes and then automatically reboots itself after seeing a pink screen. Doing a quick search, you can find ARTICLES about this issue that isn't being fixed with software updates. This must be a hardware issue... God I hope they didn't cheap out again.
Liked:- Long battery life (one charge WILL last all day, i.e. 16 hours. Personally tested true)- Speed (the new M1 processor really is fast)- Quiet (no fan but the laptop still does not get hot)- Light and portable- High resolution & bright displayDisliked:- As with other MacBooks, the keyboard is mediocre especially compared to laptops like Lenovo Thinkpad- Incompatible applications (With the M1 processor still being new, you might experience existing programs frequently crash. For example, Chrome keeps crashing) But I would guess there will be a fix soon
I'm a fan of apple products and I like almost everything about this new MBA. But it has one huge flaw that nobody talks about. It's the camera hardware and it hasn't been updated in ages. My zoom calls are so grainy and bad even with decent light. A $1000 laptop with 10 year old front camera is unacceptable. Camera is very important to me. Especially now that we all are quarantined at home and making zoom calls all the time.
UPDATE 12-15-2020 - After three weeks, I'm still really impressed with the M1 MacBook Air/8 Core CPU/8 Core GPU/512 SSD/8GB RAM. --- My updated plea: MAKE SURE YOU GET AS MUCH MEMORY & STORAGE AS YOU CAN AFFORD. SPECIAL ORDER ONE TO YOUR PROJECTED FUTURE NEED!Remember, Macs live a very long time and the value it holds will depend on how usable it will be to you or someone else in 5 or even 10 years. Not that long ago, 80 GB hard drives were HUGE... and UPGRADABLE. RAM was upgradable. The SSD and the RAM in these machines is NOT upgradable.The one issue for me has been that I am a memory hog! I tend to have LOTS of tabs open at once (I've caught myself with 50 (Safari) open in one browser and 39 (Chrome) in another!), while running Affinity/Final Cut Pro - and YES, the dreaded Beach Ball has reared it's ugly head. Well, this got me to assess what I will be using the machine for and for how long.Storage can be added with external drives, slower, but it will let you scrape by. RAM is another story. When you constantly use up RAM, the system starts using "swap memory" where it uses the SSD to store temporary files. One of the YouTube reviewers (Created Labs) explains it like this: RAM memory is like writing on a white board, it's made to be temporary. Writing to the SSD is like writing on paper with a pencil. It can be erased, but if it's written on and erased for too long, it's going to degrade the medium. It will take years for this to cause problems, but keep in mind that in these M1 MacBooks, none of the parts are replaceable. The SSD and the RAM are soldered onto the board.***As ridiculously expensive as Apple RAM is, when it's not upgradable, get the maximum, in this case, 16 GB.I really doubt that Apple will be making machines with user upgradable RAM after the switch from Intel is complete, except for possibly the very high end Pro models.There is also the fact that if I am going to be doing a decent amount of video editing, a M1 with a fan will be helpful. Upgrading to the cheaper ($699+Upgrades) M1 Mac mini would be the cheapest way to get better performance for the Pro Apps, but I need a laptop, so... So, that is why I'm planning to return this machine and get one (likely the MacBook Pro M1), with 16 GB RAM & 1 TB SSD.***A note on browsers, Safari is by far the BEST browser to run on the M1, at least for now. I always had issues with saving web pages as PDF files in Chrome, where it did not save most of the images/text on the page. In Safari, it's worked perfectly.------I purchased the MacBook Air M1, 8 core GPU, and 8 core CPU model, with 512 GB SSD and 8 GB RAM in person at the Apple Store (11-20-2020), with education pricing. I traded in my (MNYH2LL/A) - 2017 12" Macbook with the Intel M3 processor, 256 GB SSD, 8 GB Ram. I kept my charging adapter & C-cable (which are both compatible with the M1 Late 2020 Macbook Air), so ended up with a $330 Apple Store instant credit towards the M1.The M1 model has blown me away with its speed and smooth running with a large number of apps open, including Final Cut & Logic Pro. Admittedly the 2017 MB was the bottom of the line and I suffered under frequent overheating issues with too many things open and the single C-port fiasco.I likely would have gone with the 7 core GPU model if one had been in stock at the time of purchase, but I wanted 512 GB of SSD space, so I paid more by going with eh 8 core. From everything that I've seen, the lack of more RAM upgrades is not nearly as important as it was with the Intel x86 processors and is really only useful when you have many GPU intensive "Pro Apps" running at the same time.I would never have dreamed of running Final Cut or Logic Pro on the 2017 Macbook, so this has been an amazing upgrade for me.I would say that the bottom line is that if you're someone who only uses a laptop for office & basic web surfing and only has a few tabs open at once, and you never experience overheating or the dreaded beach ball "not responding" issues, or if you have non-Apple programs that have not been compiled for the M1 chip, hold off on the upgrade until more apps run natively on the M1. If however, you really need a machine that is MUCH more capable, faster and cooler running than the Intel models, it's a solid buy and an amazing upgrade from any non-upgradable Mac.
I cannot believe how bad this camera is on the so-called sophisticated Apple product? And no USB ports - how ridiculous  is that? So if you want to use an external mouse you can’t do that - I could go on!
I have big hands. This computer was not made for anyone who has large hands. My hands cramp constant as i type and i cannot get a bigger/better computer because of how much i have already spent. It is extremely frustrating. It is so small. I mistype constantly and have accidentally deleted many important things!!! This computer also glitches ALOT. It is constantly changing my mouse from “single click” to “double” . It constantly opens new tabs and new pages for no reason. Waste of money. Just buy a pc. I am regretful
Theres a serious glitch where you can't use touch ID if drained from dead battery. Then it will ask you for a password. Unclear if this is an apple ID password or whatever, but mine didn't work. Tried every combo I knew. And then there is no option for reset password. Just none at all. And then it won't enter recovery mode. Just a horrible product, stay far away
Dropped about $2500 on 3 of these roughly 3 years ago.  One had battery issues, one had logic board failure which Apple would not cover, and 3rd is doing fine.  Apple has kept up with design quality, camera is top notch, but does not meet quality expectations overall.  With the reduced cost of Windows machines, may be time to step out of my Apple bubble.
Do not buy refurbished/ used laptops from Amazon. Often times they are stolen and when you need software upgraded or fixed the manufacturer will not touch the computer when they figure out its stolen. Amazon will not refund or replace the computer with one that is not stolen. So you are stuck with stolen goods that can not be repaired through the manufacturer
They really should issue a recall on this particular model. The screen cracks on its own and yet Apple denies there is an issue. Going to be exchanging this for an older model that at least will last.
Don't be fulled by 13" description. Its bigger! And much heavier! New Air completely lost its purpose to be small and light laptop that is convenient on the go. If I wanted a bigger and more capable laptop I would have bought a PRO not an AIR. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE make a normal size AIR
Bad Apple! Battery always drop dead without any reason. Sometimes, it is still 90% of battery, but it dropped dead in the middle of nowhere, or freeze, the screen just freezes 10 times a day at least. I have to force it to power off and on 10 times a day at least. I only have the Mac Air for 3+ Years, totally a junk!
If you are planning on using a dock/dongle with this, you might want to wait. Having TONS of issues with USB not working via dock/dongle. Has happened with a few different brand/models of docks/dongles. Very frustrating and Mac forums/Apple customer service have been no help so far.
GRAINY UNUSABLE CAMERA. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP. OR ANY LATEST 2020 MODEL - APPLE REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE. WHAT A DISGRACE FOR A COMPANY LIKE APPLE CUSTOMER SERVICE TO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE FLAW.
cant seem to find a case that will fit the bottom of my new m1 macbook air
Update 09/01/21:Still going strong!Unreal has really smoothed out the bugs. This thing is an absolute beast, beats my old desktop easily.I can run Photoshop, Unreal, Lots of tabs in safari/firefox, and background processes; all no issues. Heck, I can even run a game with unreal engine going in the background. I've rarely noticed slowdowns, and when I have it's always been a software issue (typically memory leaks).I've abandoned windows... Haven't loaded it outside of a VM more than a few times this year. Don't hesitate to get this if you're looking for a new laptop.Update 01/11/21:Well, I had some issues but I love this thing enough I'm sticking with it.I believe a 3rd party USB hub killed the logic board and touch ID for it. I had to wait about a month to go theough the motions, especially with the time of year. Finally got my replacement back today and I'm really happy.Unreal Engine does not run well currently. It gets crashes and will freeze the computer. Everything else runs super smoothly and I never have issues. Really happy with the laptop.Initial post:Let me start this off by saying I was very skeptical. Lifelong Windows user, I've only had an iPod touch (2011) and very briefly an iPhone 6 (I think). I also have pretty demanding needs as far as day to day laptop use goes.This thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. The only drawback is that my current model only has 8GB RAM, but if you're conscious about what you have open it's not an issue; even with more intensive programs like Photoshop or Unreal Engine 4. Neither of which are even optimized for the platform yet, which as stated in the title, is really impressive.Gaming has been equally impressive. To be fair, I haven't thrown a next-gen game at it yet, but I threw games that I thought would be able to max it out. Nope, Civ 6, Borderlands 1, and Oxygen Not Included all ran at Ultra with FPS staying at steady 60+ in each game, even in more intensive portions of each game. I'm not saying it'll be able to play every game at ultra, but it's definitely been able to handle more than I though it would. It almost seems to be outperforming my desktop, which has an i7@3.4, and a 970ti. I think it might if I had the extra GPU core and 16gb ram, which is crazy for a laptop at this price.Overall, it's worth every penny. I could rant about all the small features that make the OS amazing as well, but you can find videos of that online/may already be familiar.
The first one I received got bricked trying to restore after the initial setup failed.The second one is fine.You can google the issues.Apple support said I'd need to bring the first one into the apple store for a firmware update to get it working.Not great for a brand new 1000$ laptop.Anyway the second one came already updated and everything has been fine so I'm happy now.It's snappy and has that new macbook smell.
This laptop is very good for students and people wanting to do basic work as well as people who are going to have this laptop under EXTREME loads. I've ran heavy games and video editors and its done amazing! it's even beat some of my other $8,000 MacBooks! It's very light weight ( 2.8 pounds ) and is very thin but yet durable. It doesn't feel cheap like some laptops at this price point, It feels very premium with the metal body and soft keys and the retina display. The track pad is VERY large for the size of this laptop. I also love how it's fan-less so it never makes any noise which is another reason why it's good for students. ( video calls, etc. ) My one and only complaint is the camera quality. It looks nice if you have good lighting but if you're in bad lighting it looks like a potato filming. But if you can get passed that it's great. I also love how the keyboard is backlit, it helps a lot if you're in a dark environment. The screen is also very good, it's nice and bright and has amazing colors which is very good for photo editing! The package even came several days early and shipped very fast! Although the costumer service isn't very good. they didn't answer the questions I messages them about. ( I'll try to answer some questions I had ) It does come sealed in the original Apple packaging and it does have the M1 chip. All around I highly recommend this. It's amazing for the price tag.
I love everything Apple did to update the Air. It’s, by far, the best laptop you can buy right now. That’s especially true if you were a Mac user before. I wasn’t, so I had to learn where everything was and what not, but it didn’t take to long.The battery life is PHENOMENAL and I have had 0 issues with the thermals. When Apple said it would cool passively, they weren’t lying. I’ve had 8-9 programs running simultaneously and it was obviously warmer, but nothing compared to any other laptop I’ve used. The fact that it’s dead silent when running is a nice perk as well.I like how they kept a lot of the tried and true design on the outside because I don’t think many people saw anything wrong with it to begin with.The screen has amazing clarity and, in true Apple fashion, all of my Apple devices connect seamlessly.Absolutely the best laptop one can buy right now.
This is a great desktop. I have it paired with a Dell hi res display I purchased with my old Mac. My old Mac was getting unreliable (2015). This air is very similar to the Mac but faster, reliable. I like the larger touch pad and don't have to use a wireless mouse. I have a USB type C HUB to get more connectivity. Keyboard is great.
I decided to treat myself this year to this. Ordered it on the Apple website and was told 1-2 weeks. I ordered it on Amazon and it was here in 2 days for the same price! Love this! As for the product ... you can not go wrong with Apple. I was a little shook by the price but its worth every penny.
Works like an Apple should
works great
I love it
Long battery life. Fast performance.
great mac for everyday use
Very good seal pack
IntroAs a college student, having a reliable and portable workstation is extremely valuable. The New MacBook Air powered by the M1 chip is one of the most exciting devices recently released by Apple. Although it looks just like the previous models, the M1 chip delivers insanely great performance.Design and buildSince its inception, Macbook Air’s design and build were one of its core selling points, and the Macbook Air M1 is no exception. It has that Signature Aluminium body that you’ll see with the other Macbook Variants. The laptop not only looks premium but it definitely feels like your money’s worth. You can easily open this laptop with only one finger, this is possible because of the incredibly engineered hinge design done by apple. One of the things that the original Macbook air lacked for a while was a decent display, gone are the days of a 720p panel. And brought is a beautiful P3 Wide color gamut 2560*1440p panel, The overall viewing experience is awesome! The bezels are the same size as last year's model, which was kinda disappointing when compared to other laptops recently released, but it's not something that will ruin the overall viewing experience. The updated magic keyboard has better travel and also the gigantic mouse pad is always a blessing, I’m yet to find a trackpad on a laptop that I like better than the ones made by apple. The dual speaker grills on this laptop produce pretty decent sound, however, there is some slight distortion at high volumes.StorageStorage is also very important as a college student. As you're going to need some space to store all your documents, files, and Zoom Lectures. The MacBook Air comes with up to 2TB of SSD storage. This specific model I have only had 128GB of storage which honestly should be fine for most students, and if you don’t want to spend a lot of money you can always buy an external SSD or hard drive. This will cost you way less than what Apple offers.PortabilityAs a College student in 2021, because of Covid, it's been kinda different, (Very small pause)all of our classes nowadays are held on zoom or some other online platform. So if you wanna use this laptop outside of a typical campus setting, then portability starts to matter. The MacBook Air weighs in at 2.75 pounds and is 15.6mm thick. This laptop will easily fit in most backups without feeling a noticeable weight difference. This is important to a lot of students, especially if you have back-to-back classes keeping in mind the average textbook weighs just over 4.6 pounds. This Laptop also easily fits in most handbags for women who were wondering.Reliability and BatteryThe Apple MacBook Air has proven itself as one of the most reliable laptops for a student this past decade. The Macbook Air is going to be a more compelling laptop for the students this, because of its insanely reliable performance for its price, but let's talk about the chip that’s made all this possible.The biggest change this year is no doubt the M1 chip, the ARM-based chip is fast,  like stupid fast. Applications open up real quick and the performance is consistently reliable. Not only can it easily fly through day-to-day tasks like browsing the internet and typing research papers, but it can also handle intensive tasks such as 4K video editing, in fact, I managed to edit an entire 4K video on the M1 MacBook air and the performance & exporting times were very impressive. Anyway, that was sometimes impossible on the previous-gens of Macbook air. Now if you are considering this device for video editing then I would highly recommend the 16 Gig variant.The next best thing aside from its insane performance is the incredible battery life, I think this is the best battery life I have ever seen on a laptop of this form factor. The laptop lasted me multiple days of light usage with the usual workload being typing, browsing, and streaming content. I can pull a full day of heavy usage with tasks like editing photos and videos.ConclusionOverall there’s a quote that says, “Speed is irrelevant if you are going in the wrong direction”. (Mahatma Gandhi). The Macbook Air M1 has set a new benchmark for consistent performance and delivers insanely awesome battery life which makes the overall experience pretty fire. Its Portability, reliability, and speed not only make this a great investment for a student but also for anybody who’s always on the go, and I’m personally really excited for the direction that Apple is heading towards with their new M lineup of processers.
Great quality and price. Beautiful screen, easy to use
No problems with the mac air. Easy to transition from my old 2104 MacBook Pro. I also bought an external HD which was cheaper than upgrading from old 256 to 512. My warning is about Office 2019. There was stuff on the web that 2016 would not work, needed 64bit, but while there seemed to be workarounds, I just upgraded and bought 2019. There is a scam site posing as Microsoft Office/setup that looks legit once on it, but you get an error message and phone number to resolve. After half an hour he explains that it is the firewall and can fix it by downloading one costing only hundreds of dollars. The url isn't Microsoft but rest looks like it. While I didn't fall for it, it is preying on the few who might. So thought I would mention it. The mac is good and worth upgrading especially if, as with mine, hardware faults are developing in old one.
I JUST GOT IT TODAY I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION ORDERING IT HERE. I HAVE NO ISSUE BOUT IT AT ALL I GAVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE THERE IS A TINY DENT NOT A BIG DEAL.
i love it! i’ve had it for about 2 weeks now and it’s the best laptop i’ve ever owned. i do play games on it (mainly sims) and it doesn’t lag or mess up which i’m happy with. great buy and i’m happy i bought it!
Purchased for my daughter in college and she loves it. She used one before and knew exactly what she wanted for a college digital graphing classes
It was very nice 😍 good price I got it on Christmas and Amazon dealAwesome sauce
this is my first mac although I have had my iphone for a couple years. This mac was a piece of cake to set up.love it
I really liked this laptop - it has all I needed! Really appreciate the really good packaging and on-time arrival. It is also working very fast.
I use this for college and it is great! It was really difficult to learn how to use. It is so different from an IPhone. But it loads quick and is beautiful. It picks up finger prints more than your phone does and you can really see them too so make sure to wash your screen but besides that it is amazing! Especially for the price I got it for of $850!
This is a phenomenal laptop and not just at its price point. The M1 chip is snappy and fast, the battery life is amazing and the screen quality is excellent. All of that is bundled in a thin, light and quiet (fan-less) form factor. I’d highly recommend this MacBook Air unless you want to run high intensity games (they just aren’t native to Mac OS and won’t run as well as they will on Windows).
I'm new to the Mac world, at least since the early days in the 80s. So far it has been a pleasant experience and I like the stock software and layout. I haven't really had to purchase any additional apps to be able to do the things that I've become accustomed to on PCs, so there is a nice learning curve. I do have a couple of constructive criticisms, that are not specific to the MacBook Air, though. In the future, I'd like to see touchscreens included on their laptop models (being a former teacher of persons with autism, they really benefit from the additional input method). Also, the Retina display is awesome, but maybe in some of their higher priced laptops like the MacBook Pro they can start using OLEDs as model upgrades. Other than that I'm a fully satisfied Mac devotee now (though I still love my PCs)!
Arrived quickly packed in harder-than-normal, fitted cardboard box...that was inside another box containing a coat we ordered. (Excellent packing). Waited to unpack it until new cover/screen & keyboard protectors arrived. This is the first Mac I have bought online and the migration looked easy. But it hasn't worked. I've taken down(and since put back up) the firewalls on both new and old laptops, as advised, but  it never did migrate. But signing into everything Apple was easy and I LOVE having finger ID...I'm also looking forward to better battery life and appreciate a slightly larger screen. Great discount. Husband gave me a new iPad in September and I'm anxious to see how I can use that as a secondary screen with MacBook Air.
Love it. I wish they would upgrade the damn cameras but it does the job. I’m not using it to take photos. But as far meetings go it would be nice. I didn’t realize I was running like 6 different programs. This thing performs without any slow down. I learn something new about it everyday. I love that my phone, my watch and my laptop all talk to each other. So no matter where I write it is saved to the iCloud. Happy with my purchase. Got the headphones and Magic Mouse too. No complaints here.
It’s just overpriced for what it is. An equivalent windows computer is $400 cheaper with the same specs and functionality.
I have purchased at amazon many times, I am satisfied with all products, about this macbbok air m1 works very well and the price is very good, I think I should hurry to own it, this can also be a gift.
Does what is promised and more. Great laptop
I’ve read amazing things about Apple’s new chips but I was still blown away by how well everything worked.  Zero fan noise (possibly zero fan, period), can play all the games I care about (Factorio/FTL/Rimworld/LoL/FFXIV), and everything is snappy as hell. I even bought a Windows Laptop for the same price to compare it to and there was no contest.  Even at $1000 the windows laptop constantly felt cheap, loud, and underpowered.  Needless to say I returned the Windows Laptop and have been enjoying the MacBook Air ever since.
Coming from a long history of Windows computers, this is by far the best laptop I have ever owned for home use. The price could not be beaten at $850 at the time, and I couldn't be happier.
It's just amazing !! this one with the m1 chip is a game changing , but i highly recommend to get the extra storage and the 16 gb ram i mean am not saying that the 8 gb ram won't work but i highly recommend to get the 16 gb ram if you're looking to run multiple tasks on this MacBook or playing games from steam .
This is just the update I needed for school and my graphic/marketing job. Lightweight and perfect to travel with.
Thank you
an excellent option, for work, have some problem with docker!! (for developers guys) the rest all very well, the screen, and the sound, and options are good, we only recommend a base for MacBook, for some heat in the down of the laptop, but I think is because don't have Forced ventilation for the Processor.
I wood buy it again. I’ve been a PC owner all my life and thus is my first Mac. I think I will stick with it.
I am very pleased to have my new iPad.Great to have!!
Good buy
I love my computer
Performance is extraordinary. My first Mac Book and I am absolutely  in love.
Great product for what's it's purpose.
Replaced a previous MacBook Air with the new version. Same sleek design, upgraded performance. The computer is quick and easy to use. Plus it is lighter than the 2011 version I replaced.
Report abuse
I love this MacBook...beening using it for two months and total worth the price and effort ❤️
I order the gaming programs and haven't been able to use it not sure why
I expected more speed from it.
Not much to say here that’s different from what’s been said elsewhere. Build quality on point per usual with Apple. Feels as slick as ever. No problems thus far about app compatibility with the M1 chip. As with almost all apple products, you can purchase with your eyes closed.
I am nearly 60 and have never had a Mac.  A friend of mine talked me into it, and I love it.  It is not only user friendly but Apple offers ongoing expert customer support for ANY question or tech issue you have.  I am not tech savvy and these people are miracle workers, able even to straighten me out quickly every time I call.  Love the unit and love customer support both.
The screen and color really looks good, but the removal of USB port made me have to pay extra money for an adapter 😭
It’s a total beast. Performance, battery all seems amazing.
This is the best laptop I have ever used. I got this product a week ago and works amazing. Highly flexible, stylish, long battery life, and better screen quality. I personally highly recommend this product. Thank you Apple products for making my life easy.
very light, very convenience to carry, work very well for all my laptop use....
This is my first Mac ever. I had to go through a small learning curve to get used to the OS and the keyboard layout and shortcuts. But now I am so happy with the purchase.Really good screen, trackpad and keyboard. Amazing battery life. So compact and light. The only thing that I miss from my previous laptop is a touchscreen.I would without any hesitation recommend this for anyone looking for a handy and powerful laptop.
Love it
First let's start with the overall look of the MacBook Air, it's thin, sleek and super light.  I got the gold color one and it took me a while to decide between the silver & gold. But after receiving my gold Mac, I'm so happy I went with it. The color looks so much BETTER in person, it seems to have more of a rose gold color in person but if you take a picture of it, it looks gold.I use my Mac for some web searching, emails ( when I do so the battery does good) and if I'm doing some photo editing and downloads it dies faster. I spent all day on it and it does not get hot, so that's a plus. I don't feel like I have to give it a break.I got the standard memory and just got a hard drive to upload my photos on there ( if needed)Now the camera! it's terrible LOL but that doesn't bother me much because I won't be using or doing any zoom calls. But i wish apple would make it better since it's not a cheap lap top.I also came from not having a lap top, So far is perfect for me and what I use it for. I love that apple connects everything for you and it makes it that much easier to see emails, txt , calendar etc......I also love the vibrant color and sharpest of the screen.
Pros: Battery life : 5 stars, this machine last all day and I don't even know howScreen: 2560x1600 in a 13 inch screen is remarkableLook: It's apple so I got nothing to complainSound: You can hear this from your bathroom with curtain and door closedHEAT: DOES NOT HAVE ANY FAN SOUND AND HEAT PROBLEM AT ALL. THIS THING IS QUIET !!!Keyboard: No more butterfly keyboard!Cons: Apple got the same deal for student but they attach FREE airpod so sadly I have to return this to amazon so I can that dealSmuge spot due to fingerprint or sweat on keyboard is unavoidable and very annoying to look at but I guess it is what it is.All in all, I highly recommend this to any college student especially comp sci major to buy this. I was always a window users except for my Iphone and I also have a fair share of laptop from gaming to everyday but this M1 laptop right here beat everything else at this price point.
Excelente MacBook
No more waiting for  updating.
Love my new laptop. I use it every day for work and it’s great!! Zero complaints.
I needed to upgrade my old desk top computer and synch it with my iPhone.  Perfection.  Everything about Apple is the best and this MacBook Air is delightful.  There is so much more I can do and I can see the possibilities are endless.
Really like this laptop bought this as a gift for my wife to do her Masters and she loves it, very easy to use, super fast, screen quality is exceptional, Keyboard feels lovely and very affordable the M1 chip really made a difference only one thing if you can afford it try to bump up to the 512GB will worth it.
So happy with my purchase. Love my new MacBook Air
It's a good computer by all standards. It's pricey but you get what you pay for. Great screen and its fast. Just wish....like all electronics, that the battery lasted longer.
My daughter is a budding photographer and got this computer to edit her photos and for college. She loves everything about it, it fits her needs perfectly.
This thing is beautiful! I love it! My first MacBook 😍😍!!! BUY IT
Love my M1 laptop
Very solid laptop for its price,very satisfied with my purchase,ships and delivered the same day as well.
Just a heads up- the item is rose gold, not gold.  I'm actually happy that it's rose versus yellow gold.
I purchased it to parallel windows, however it will not!Very disappointed
This is my first Apple laptop and I LOVE IT.  It is so quick and easy to use.  There is a learning curve but luckily I have my kids.
This is the first time I have used a Mac product for an extended period of time. I have owned it for a couple months now and must admit I am very happy with how well it performs. My apprehension at buying a Mac product was in getting used to the OS, as it is considerably different from Windows. However it did not take long for me to get used to macOS, it was easy to learn and use, with much better organization than Windows.
My wife loves this little laptop and it compliments the features of her iPhone.
Love it
Like how lightweight this laptop is. Also, it is swift, In my opinion. The only thing I miss is a touch screen. Coming from a Lenovo to mac, it did take some getting used to, but I love it so far. I would recommend it.
it’s thin not too heavy a nice sleek look is the perfect laptop for school, really fast and overall great quality. my only complaint is the camera terrible quality but i don’t really use the camera overall a 9/10 connects to iphone and u can see ur messages
After years of using nothing but PC laptops, the M1 chip compelled me to try Macs. And let me tell you, the hype is justified. The new silicon MacBooks are simply incredible. The ARM-based silicon chip is so amazing that I was able to forgive the laptop for its downsides, which are the 720p webcam, lack of SD card slot, and not being able to upgrade RAM or SSD. Despite these drawbacks, the battery life is insane and the machine is completely silent because no fan is needed since the laptop is so heat-efficient. You're also getting a powerful laptop that outperforms the vast majority of Windows laptops in the market. To top it off, you get a touchpad that puts other laptops to shame, a beautiful aluminum design, and build quality that will last. Well done Apple.
I’ve wanted a MacBook for the longest time, and Amazon surprised me having the cheapest option for buying this one! So I finally took the plunge. I’m upgrading from a very tired HP. Never having experience with MacBook before, I’m in love with it. It’s awesome how much you can personalize this little laptop. Lighting fast, too. Getting to know the touch pad and all the little features is mind boggling in the best way.

Amazing and shipped fast!!!
I love the battery life. It lasts so long that I charge it sparingly. I love the instant on feature when I lift the lid. I am impressed with the biometric scanner that allows me to log in without my password. The MacBook Air allows me to log in with my Apple Watch as well. The speed is fantastic. I am thoroughly impressed. I have an M1 Mac mini as well. I am hooked.
This laptop si so light and powerful, hard to believe is something like this on the market. With fan free technology you have no noise as well nothing hot anymore under your keyboard.My daughter loves it. Battery is very good si lasting more than 8 hours. She is using it daily at HS and at home. This is a great laptop for the price.
so beautiful made. fast delivery.  It is like a new toy for me.
Item description is exactly what I got!!! Love, love,love!!!♥️ Super fast shipping and super happy with everything so far!!!!
Works amazingly. :) No complaints from me!
It's a Macbook. Slick design lightweight. Never had any issues with any of my Macbooks. The M1 chip is nice.
Apple products never let me disappointed
I was worried about the compatibility of the M1 processor but by now i can tell that at the moment all My stuff is running flawless on this Mac: all Office programs, FTP clients, compressors, vpn software, database clients, etc. Even games like CS in Steam.
The laptop is so lightweight and has a great display!
I use this to teach online. Overall extremely satisfied. Fast, reliable and looks nice. The only two things I’m not crazy about are A) the camera isn’t really HD and B) I ordered gold and it looks more like a rose gold color.
Love the size
Purchased for college
Battery life is great
Great 👍🏻
Granddaughter is using for school.
Zoom calls perfect and beautiful. Video quality is excellent.  Performance is amazing.  Running Parallels and Windows 11 preview. Screen looks beautiful.  Movies look amazing.  Audio is loud and sounds spacial.  Battery lasts easily all day and sometimes two days.Blows away my 2015 MacBook Air.  Blows away my 2016 MacBook Pro.  Don't miss the Touch Bar.Ports are enough.  But wish there was one on each side.As perfect a laptop I have owned.And this M1 MacBook air run Windows 11! I use Parallels and Windows runs super fast and looks amazing.  No impacts to battery life.  I saw some reviewers say it won’t run Windows and this is not true.
First time Macbook owner. Really happy with the MacBook Air. Don't let the lack of a fan be off-putting. The only time it gets even remotely warm is when rendering a video in iMovie. Even then, it's by no means hot to the touch. This is probably the most fail proof laptop out right now and dare I say, ever. The lack of a fan eliminates the last mechanical part and means this laptop have no moving parts. The soldered in m.2 storage and committing to your RAM choice for the life of the laptop is my only complaint. So far I'm not finding 8gb of RAM to be an issue. Most of the programs for Mac OS are pretty well optimized for the M1 chip. So Everything feels to work pretty smoothly. The battery life is next level. Over all it's more powerful, cooler and the battery lasts longer than ever. If you have been wanting to get your first MacBook or have been batting around the idea of an upgrade. This would not be a bad choice.
This is the bargain deal of the Apple lineup at the moment. The M1 chip gives it crazy power management which equates to ridiculously long battery life, incredibly low temperature operation which needs no fan so also absolute silence. All this while running circles around the competitors offerings which don’t stand a chance of keeping up with this incredible product. With their M1 chip Apple has not just revolutionized the capabilities of a laptop but turned the whole computer industry upside down! And yes it is extremely well made out of a solid chunk of aluminum, is very light and has a world class screen and a redesigned keyboard that feels wonderful. Incase you couldn’t tell I like and recommend this laptop!
Graphic designer. Great laptop.
beautiful.
I was really hesitant on making this big purchase through amazon, but this store came through. My laptop came in great condition with no marks or damage done during packaging and shipping. It came in the right color and everything. It works like a charm.
I bought my first Mac in 1986 and my first 100 shares of Apple in 1992. No one could have dreamed what Apple was to become. And I never believed that I'd get a job working for Apple, and add to those shares over the next 14 years through the employee stock ownership program. Every 3 months, I get a dividend that's 4 times what I originally paid for those 100 shares, which have now become 6428 shares through reinvesting those dividends.Which brings me to this review: The reason Apple is approaching a 3 trillion dollar market cap is because they make the greatest products in the world, and everyone wants them. And I'm writing this on the laptop in my review, and it's just an unbelievable value!
replaced the 1st one on day 4 and 2nd one dead after 9 month of very light use.  Fkin apple
It’s simple , clean aesthetically, and really powerful compared to older models . The m1 chip has really put this laptop on another level. Easy to carry and can handle simple and even hard tasks .
I love my MacBook!! But it was delivered by a over packed uhaul and left in its side out side without knocking to let me know it was there,?to sign for it, not any safeguards in place. I am grateful for the thoughtful packing on your part because it was shipped in an oversized box and no extra packing, it moved freely within the box.
I was looking to upgrade from my current dual core intel i7 Windows laptop and tablet. The 2020 MacBook Air M1 screen is sharp, the M1 processor performance is similar to intel i7 quad core for most uses . This laptop is fan-less and gets very warm/hot only when constantly exporting very large 5Gb+ files - otherwise it runs cool to cold. I edit photos on this laptop and my editing software opens much faster and the edits occur very quickly. The 8Gb ram/256 Gb ssd combo in this laptop is fast and responsive. The Mac OS memory management allows 8Gb to be more than enough for my projects. The M1 cpu performance and battery life for the MacBook Air M1 easily exceed those of my dual core i7 Windows laptop and tablet. My photo editing software runs faster and is more responsive than on my Windows devices. Also, the MacBook Air M1 performance seems the same whether on battery or ac power unlike my Windows devices. This laptop is a fantastic entry-level device but hard core gamers and video creators should upgrade to the Pro models for the larger/more vibrant screen, richer audio, cooling fans, additional usb-c ports, sd card slot, dual monitor capability, and more ram/ssd options. I purchased this used base model used at a substantial savings over the list price which made it a fantastic value. I would suggest most users get the 512Gb or larger internal ssd so you won't need an external ssd for video/music storage. I currently use external ssd drives to store my large files so the small 256Gb ssd size in the base model was not an issue. The only possible drawbacks for the MacBook Air are there are only 2 usb-c data/charging ports so you may need to purchase a dock if you need multiple connection options, (or use older usb accessories), there is no sd card slot, and software apps are still being updated for the M1 cpu. I run Microsoft Office 365 on my MacBook Air. I notice that Office 365 takes a second or two longer to load but once loaded Office 365 runs as fast as it does on Windows.  I don't use this laptop for gaming, video editing, or to connect multiple monitors so I can't comment on those uses. I was not expecting this level of performance from an entry-level device. Don't get caught up in the hype that this base model can replace the MacBook Pro models for heavy work loads or professional use - it doesn't have the heat distribution (fans) to dissipate the heat to prevent thermal throttling under heavy computing or gaming. For most users, just use and enjoy your 2020 MacBook Air M1!!
What you would expect from Apple
Love love love this MacBook just as described I order two of them one for me and my grand baby  apple is all I know....thank you so much
I play the sims all the time on it now. I can also get my work and homework done. This is a great laptop. It costly but it's worth the money.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Been wanting a MacBook for a decade-I love this one! I thought rose gold was discontinued in this model, but mine was rose gold -Love it!
I like it
Perfect as expected.
What a beast
I bought this laptop in December 2020. I was actually debating myself between this one or a similar Windows computer, I almost went for the Windows because the processor of the MacBook Air 2019 wasn't good enough (intel core i3), but I decided to wait and two weeks later this one was launched. It's way superior than any intel core processor, I just love it. I have been using it for almost two years now and it's as good as new. The other features are just what you expect them to be: super light, portable, hi-res screen. Would buy again.
If this Mac lasts as long as my old MacBook Pro (15) years, I’ll be one happy camper!I love the slimness and the gold color. ❤️
takes a bit getting use to but it's ok I guess
My first day. I’ve used MacBooks since 2006 when the first Intel processors were used. The M1 chip is amazing. I now understand why 8 Gb of RAM is perfect for this model. Crystal clear text rendering. Silky-smooth touch pad. Nice tactile response on keyboard— big improvement over the troublesome keyboards of the last 7 years. Speakers are lovely. Very pleased. Battery fully charged. Was able to easily migrate from my old 2016 MacBook Retina 12. Easy to connect with iCloud and Mac account. A couple of my non-Apple apps required Rosetta to run with M1 processor—smooth download of Rosetta. Anyone needing a high end camera might go for the MacBook Pro but this is fine for my needs.
Liked: battery life is really efficient, screen quality is also great.Disliked: some applications aren’t compatible
I purchased this as I see this was the almost 'perfect laptop' for everyday task and its a big yes!Its all about the new M1 chip that speeds up and gives a great battery life. Performance is so good that I recommend this.
An apple product that doesn't break the bank but performs well. Got this gift for the girlfriend and she absolutely loves it. Screen is amazing with vivid colors. The battery life is pretty closed to advertised, lasts the whole day without fail. It also runs adobe programs pretty smoothly so that's a plus for working professionals. Would recommend to anyone needing a portable travel buddy that can put out work too
Fast, reliable, and great!
The device is silent because it has no fans, the screen isn't Oled but it looks incredible for watching movies with vibrant colors and is very sharp making it great for text documents with small fonts. The battery life is incredibly good I can constantly get over a day with moderate to high use and yet somehow still manages to be an incredibly light device. It has a good dac and plenty of volume making it a good choice for audio lovers, especially if you use open backs since it makes no noise, and if you don't use headphones the speakers can get very loud and sound really good for a laptop. It runs mac OS which can be hard to adapt too but it is alot less power intensive than windows so you rarely have to worry about overheating or battery in daily use. If you are a professional video or photo editor or run intensive task look towards a pro computer and for everyone else this is a great choice.
loved the fast shipping and excellent price, I surprised my boyfriend with this computer and he was ecstatic, super cool!!
I chose to purchase this on Amazon since I have credit they them, it’s makes the monthly payments quite doable!  Quite happy !
I needed a fast little laptop, something light, that could work with my Cricut machine, watch streaming shows, research for my book, write my book, play some games on, and not take 20 minutes to load. This does all that, and apparently it has a touch screen! I didn't rate it because I haven't used it! That aside, it's fast, boots right up, runs my Cricut through Bluetooth,  is small and light, and I love it! The only thing is that so much still comes with a regular USB plug and I just had to buy an adapter to go from reg USB to a USB C. Anyway, love it!

As a long time windows user. I used to not really want an apple laptop at all. As I suppose apple item were so interior and always so heavy compared to premium line windows machine. However, I will admit in USA, apple give you the best choice all around. It is just lovely, indeed, it is about 50% heavier than the old I gave to my girl friend one year ago. But most others are just admirable. I list four points here.1. The BEST touchpad. Support all gestures, most rookies have no idea how to use quick way but they know we'll about touchpad, it is far more intuitive and easier to learn. And it is smooth and nice to touch. Big enough to put the whole palm upon it.2. Cheap. It only costs me $949 and I will say it is just a bargain. It cost about 1/3 compared to the Fujitsu laptop of mine or about the half price I got for her last year. Almost all premium windows machine on the same class cost more than Mac. (Even if we consider MBP14in, it is still way cheaper than those Nippon machines) and not a dime less than those laptops. Besides, apple have the best residual value after 18month usage. You can get more than 60% in an used market.3. Super super marvelous battery life. I thought 50Wh not a big deal but it actually outlast my 73Wh Panasonic CFSV1, which cost more than 4times of this machine and provide even more juice than the Intel core. Lol.4. It is very good to use with other apple items. As I basically buy a bunch of apple items for my girlfriend as she need some good items to help with life but google cannot provided. Therefore, I took a look on apple. Airpod pro connect to ipad pro, sharing same song. Switch player to Mac or switch back to ipad, iphone. All so smooth. One apple item is good, a bunch of apple is affordable and stunning (As a long time Sonyer, I envy apple fans as I can never afford a whole SONY system, facepalm)Only one two drawbacks.1. The screen quality is not a top notch any more, it is a good panel in less than $1000 but it is not belong to the premium line.2. The weight is really over exaggerated. 1296grams really too heavy these days.All in all, just buy it for good once Amazon restock it. Actually I bought another one for myself as I want to try apple once, maybe I will switch to apple also as it saves tons of money.I highly recommend it.
I've owned my fair share of laptops and let me tell you.. Nothing even comes close to this. Spectacular battery life, incredible display, tactile keyboard and haptic track pad with all its' gestures and features which makes multitasking a wonderful experience. to top it all off, Big Sur (os) wraps it all up and makes your workflow the greatest pleasure. Only thing I would change is the camera. It is decent in a well lit environment but struggles in the dark. Putting a bigger sensor is a hardware limitation and I understand that. Having a display this thin comes with its' sacrifices. If I could give this laptop 10 stars I would. Don't hesitate on purchasing it, you won't regret it.
I don't get the hype about M1 chip. Half of my programs aren't compatible with it and some aren't updated anymore so there is a little hope for a fix. The camera is horrible as well, picture quality is worse then what my 3 years old smartphone produces
It delivered in perfect condition after shipping a long way. I fell in love immediately. The keyboard is easy to navigate, the screen size is perfect. It is very light and perfect for my needs
This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I truly love it, and believe it is the best air ever made. No plans to upgrade anytime Sumer. Truly revolutionary in the laptop genre. Cheers Apple!
excellent
My daughter loves it
I’ve always wanted a MacBook, no complaints here, it’s dope.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
This has everything I could possibly want in a laptop and more! I love being able to use my fingerprint to access my laptop! It is thin and light for easy portability as well! Definitely recommend!
awesome product, hope it can lasts long.
I purchased this at the beginning of March, and for the past month, I have found out that this has been really efficient for me. I have been able to use this laptop for multiple school purposes and even stream movies and tv shows which has been really nice for me. The battery efficiency is also really nice I must add.
Bought it on sale. Works well. Did not need the pro version. Price should fall closer to the release date of newer model.
This is what I'd hoped for w/ the MacBook. Great typing, fast and super media performance. A perfect stay at home compliment to my Pixelbook Go.
Such a beautiful laptop! It’s an adjustment going from an Hp to a Mac, but I am loving it!
It’s an M1 chipped MacBook Air, has the previous version and this is the best one so far battery lasts a long time, even with hours of straight use, does not get hot while charging and no fans to hear !! Yippee.
Have been needing a new computer for months. researched this Apple MacBook Air. Read many positive reviews. Was delivered two days ago and am very happy with my purchase!
I've had a variety of Apple equipment in my life-- but also Microsoft Surface, Surface Laptops, Chromebooks, and more. I'm an open minded technology user and tend to go with best of breed or technology that pushes the envelope of what is possible. I like well designed hardware that looks and feels good, and works well.I bought this one open box, that shouldn't matter at all, and it doesn't. It arrived from Amazon Warehouse Deals as "like new" condition with "like new box" and the unit had no scratches/scrapes on it and was missing 3 months of warranty-- I'm happy to have the remainder.The latest Macbook I had was the 12" Macbook from several years back. It was quite nice but was too small for me. This one has continued to improve on the screen, battery life and CERTAINLY has improved on the performance front.The unit is thin, svelte, and HEAVY. I mean, it could be a solid block of metal and I would expect the same heft. It's solid. This is not a bad thing for a device that is this thin & small to add some durability to what could otherwise be a very delicate device.The keyboard is very solid with a nice clickety-click, I am not able to tell a difference from this keyboard to the generations that were rather "controversial" and I very much do appreciate the touch ID in the power button.Having two USB-C ports is very welcomed compared to my previous which had only one.When looking at the performance of the M1 chip and all previous models, especially the 12" Macbook, and comparing to the prices those still sell for, it was a no brainer to go with this model. Even compared to the Macbook Pro M1, there is a very slight difference between the two and for a rather light user the cost here was really an incredible value.I love Windows for some things. I have Windows running on this unit as well with Parallels-- easy and simple-- do note you will need to download ARM Windows 10 media for this unit-- I was not able to find a way to migrate my previous VM from Intel based.  It runs very well here and with no issues. Very fast.One thing that didn't work great for me-- maybe it's me-- maybe it's Mac OS-- was plugging it in to a USB-C dock. I have a standard setup at home with 3 monitors, USB based external bose speakers, keyboard, mouse, and typically as I cycle through Chromebooks and Windows devices, I'm able to plug in and fairly easily extend / activate those monitors, use the peripherals and printer/etc. In this case I haven't had success getting this Mac to work with my USB-C based dock and accessories-- to be determined.The screen is beautiful, the hardware is unbelievably solid, the speed is amazing.  I also have a Surface Laptop that I love, but for the Mac variety, this is my perfect equivalent.

I needed a new laptop quickly after I accidentally drowned my previous MacBook Air (reached for a bottle of water without taking my eyes off the screen, didn't realize the bottle was uncapped, and...sploosh! One waterlogged keyboard, plus one soaked and angry cat who'd been napping peacefully beside me on the couch.) Ordered this one quickly on someone else's computer and it arrived the next day. I'm no computer genius and am way older than the generation that grew up with assorted devices in their hands from babyhood, so there are still a lot of things I haven't figured out how to do. But I quickly (for me) got the new one filling my basic needs, and am working on what else it can do.Not a very useful review for those who want technical details, sorry! More of a reassurance that if you need a laptop that is user-friendly when you're not a knowledgeable user, this one will do the job nicely.

I recently bought a MacBook Air after my 2011 iMac had to be retired. I saw reviews about the new M1 processer in the new mac line up so out of curiosity I had to try it out for myself and I have been a fan of Arm processors for many years. It has exceeded my expectations and then some when it comes to programming, audio, some gaming and everyday computing. This is an excellent machine and the craftsmanship that went into it and its overall design is second to none. This the fastest mac I have owned. I have been an apple user since 1984. It deserves an extra star. TY Amazon.
What can I say, it's a Mac, and our SEO copywriting team wanted it...so now everyone has one. I'm a Surface Book fan but have to say that this is a solid machine, easy to use and fast - perfect when buying in bulk for your team members, it helps improve employee experience.Now..it is definitely overpriced for what you get tech-wise because of the Apple hype, the correct price point for it should be about $200 less than what it is. Then again, when you look at that rose gold color and the apple logo - it's all sunshine and rainbows, and the world becomes a better place again.
the MacBook is well worth the extra money. Is a lot more compatible with iPhone then the other makes. like other apple products you don't have to pay for security like on other makes which offer different security options for a price per year and most of the time their security is never as good as apple.  great product lots of features 5 stars.
Showed up packaged well, no dents no cracks and was more than i was expecting. I had a 2010 macbook air before and this just exceeded all my expectations!! Love it :) Price was even better and arrived in a timely manner!
I love it
By the looks of it, the M1 chip only supports ONE external monitor. if you are planning to use more than one monitor with this machine, please do not. it's too late for me
After almost 10years with a MacBook Air, I thought it was time to upgrade to the latest model.  I loved the previous one.  So far though - not in love.  Although I do find it nice and fast and like the features, there have been issues with the trackpad right out of the box.  A quick look at some forums to try to resolve the problem indicated that this is a known issue for Apple, so I'm considering returning it before it becomes a hassle to fix.  For the price of a Mac and the length of time the model has been on the market, I feel like something right out of the box should work like a dream and I'm not wild about spending a lot of time on fixes or workarounds.  Also, thunderbolt port is great and all, but since the rest of the world still uses USBs, could they not have just added one port, to alleviate the need to purchase an adaptor as well?  Disappointed, Apple.
Best battery life
air drop does not work even after two hours with apple tec support.Will not save log in details even after save log in pop up appears.Tells me there is an update one day but refuses to download it, then the next day says its up to date and no updates available.I have been a mac book user for ten years and would be returning this macbook air if I was at home in Canada. I guess that I am stuck with it as I am out of country for a while.
the m1 MacBook air is the best bang for the buck no windows laptop will come close  you can photo edit et do video editing on it . super long battery life and same performance plugged or from the batteries . last around 15h of web browsing and 7-8 on heavy usage
Just getting the hand of it after windows but all good
This laptop is just WOW. Great for students, and for minecraft when I have a long break between classes.
so far so good, my first apple laptop was previously a windows only userreally enjoying my macbook airfastlife changing battery lifei do miss having a usb port but not the end of the world, just get a bluetooth mousesuper portablelove the key board
Excellent!!!!!
Package came late and box kinda damage but works i guess
AM HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE
Absolutely love my new MacBook after almost a month of use. It's smooth, sleek and that M1 chip makes the air a beast 🤗
This new MacBook is fast and reliable. I was having troubles with the new Windows-based computer I bought, and I need a compact, fast computer to meet all of my business needs. I'm very happy to be back with a Mac, and this one is so light and 'Airy' not bulky at all (size and ease of use)! Much better than the older, clunky MacBook Pro I had in the past!
All good
I bought this machine to watch movies on the go and it's perfect. The Midi setup lets you connect more than one set of a variety of different headphones, including, but not limited to Airpods. It's light and has a slim profile. I picked space grey because I reasoned it would hold up better in the long run and not reveal scratches. So far, so good. Also, the price was right.
Teams application caused a number of problems like graphics glitches and performance issues.  They're still working out the kinks in the OS for Apple silicone, but Apple support has been great since I am under warranty. They will repair as necessary if it is hardware issue.
I like the fact that it's easy to use and long battery life
Bad don't buy,Ihate hackers and apple products
couldn't even load a blank unity project cuz the specs are that bad. I tried refunding it 10 days ago and still haven't gotten my money back.
I am satisfied with this MacBook Air. I noticed that as MacBooks age, some keys get disappointingly sticky. This was true with the 2016 MacBook Pro--and I had to give it away after getting the Air. The typing experience on this MacBook Air is by far superior, compared to the Pro 2016. It's also way much faster.
Excellent investment as quality product and price.
My Asus Zenbook decided to crash on me in the middle of my finals week. After 5 years with me, the battery died and the charger was not charging the laptop anymore. I figured the cost to get it fixed would amount close to purchasing a used Macbook and I needed a computer ASAP. This Macbook Air M1 chip is a dream and to have purchased it used at a reasonable price was the ultimate cherry on top! It came within 2-3 days with its original packaging and in excellent condition with about 80% battery upon arrival. This has been one of the best last minute purchase I've ever made and I'm beyond happy with it so far!
2 days after receiving the laptop it stopped working - after logging in the screen was just black.  Would not connect to apple server to reinstall, then when was able to it gave more error messages.  Returning it. Appears as though this laptop was a managed device for a business as all kinds of restrictions in place.
I got this item Damage display and dent on it
After a week  of using this 2020 M1 air I must say the performance exceeds my expectations compared with the 13" MacBook Pro (2017) home office computer its replacing. Great value considering the latest MacBook Pros with roughly the same specs run nearly double (fan included ;)
Won't let me load my music. also, for some reason my I-pad keeps asking for passwords and user names repeatedly when trying to get music to play. I don't know if these are related. Other usability problems. Track pad very touchy. Would only recommend this to someone I disliked. I didn't want a window machine but I guess I need to get one. Under the hammer for this one.
I like everything about this laptop
MacBook Air M1 as expected, prompt delivery in excellent condition.
could use a larger screen
Excellent investment as quality product and price.
Nice and fast shipping!
just impeccable!!! i love my macbook!
"(upbeat music)"
"- So when these new Mac Pros got announced,"
"my first thought was,"
"""Huh? I wonder if we can retire the Travel iMac."""
"'cause some of you might not know this,"
"but whenever I'd go for the past couple of years"
"to a tech event that I planned on making a video at,"
"I literally packed up a maxed out iMac Pro,"
"put it in a huge Pelican case and lugged it with me."
"Like there's countless times y'all would catch me rolling"
"this huge box behind me through the airport."
"And that's because it's been the smallest machine"
"that I could take with me to one of those events"
"that could render and edit and export a video"
"that wouldn't take overnight."
"Now this Apple Silicon transition for Macs"
"has been pretty impressive."
"And I think this is the first time"
"I can truly say something is actually next level."
"These laptops have been next level."
"So these are the new 14 inch and 16 inch 2021 MacBook Pros."
"And they're incredible for a number of reasons."
"Now, at the end of the day,"
"they're just tools used to get a job done."
"And the fact is everyone has a slightly different thing"
"that they want to get done."
"For me, it's making these videos."
"So we'll get to that in a second,"
"but man, they have made a big jump both on the inside"
"and the outside of these laptops."
"So let's start on the outside."
"So these laptops have a new top-notch design,"
"it still looks like a MacBook Pro,"
"but I like pretty much all of the changes they've made."
"So the whole shape is squared off a bit"
"and it resembles those old aluminum Powerbooks,"
"just more modernized."
"And just aesthetically, you can see they've made"
"these laptops thicker, like noticeably thicker,"
"and that is totally fine with me."
"And it has plenty of benefits"
"and it also stands up a little bit higher"
"on those taller feet,"
"which seemingly gives it a bit more room for those back"
"and side vents for better ventilation."
"Although I've never heard the fans spin up audibly"
"on these laptops."
"The Apple logo on the back, slightly larger."
"And there's a little engraving at the bottom now"
"where they carved in the MacBook Pro text."
"That's kind of nice, but functionally,"
"as you've probably noticed, yeah, there's ports now."
"There are real ports and this really shouldn't"
"be a big deal, but this is one of the few things"
"that Apple has actually walked back from the last few years"
"of MacBook Pros that haven't had these ports."
"So while it feels like kind of silly to celebrate them,"
"I am happy that they're back."
"So on the right side, that's a full-sized HDMI port,"
"welcome back."
"And you have one of the Thunderbolt 4 ports"
"and a full-size, half-depth SD card slot."
"This is beautiful."
"I use an SD card for audio"
"every time I make a video."
"I use 'em all the time"
"and it's been a long time since I just plugged"
"an SD card straight into a computer."
"So this is fun."
"Then around the left side,"
"you have two more Thunderbolt 4 ports,"
"a headphone jack and the magnetic MagSafe charging port"
"has made its return."
"So, okay a couple of thoughts on this port selection."
"First of all, MagSafe has made its return,"
"but it's different."
"I've never used a MagSafe machine full-time in the past,"
"but this is a newer, thinner and actually stronger MagSafe."
"It's got a lot more lateral strength that it takes"
"to pull it out of the machine."
"So the second there's any angle on it,"
"it snaps out much easier,"
"but still feels pretty MagSafe to me,"
"definitely safer than just if USB-C was plugged straight in."
"And then you get this huge charging brick."
"So this is the 96-watt power adapter"
"that comes with the 14 inch MacBook Pro,"
"which is already an upgrade from the 67 watt"
"of the base model."
"And then there's this huge rectangular 140-watt"
"charging brick for the 16 inch MacBook Pro."
"But it is pretty nice that the brick is separate"
"from the braided USB-C cable with MagSafe on the other end,"
"but I am not sure why the space gray laptop"
"doesn't also come with a space gray MagSafe connector."
"That would have been a nice touch."
"140 Watts though that is a lot of power."
"And so you can fast charge these laptops through MagSafe"
"if you want to."
"It's about half charge in half an hour,"
"which is pretty convenient, but even if you don't want to,"
"you can unplug and just plug in via USB-C."
"If you're a one charger for everything kind of person"
"like me, it'll still be about 96 Watts."
"So not as fast, but still pretty good."
"Now the headphone jack,"
"you might've caught during Apple's presentation"
"that they mentioned that the headphone jack"
"this time would support high impedance headphones."
"What does that mean?"
"Well, if you have to ask, it probably doesn't apply to you,"
"but there's a whole ecosystem of headphones out there"
"with much higher levels of power required"
"to get real volume out of them."
"They're known as high impedance headphones."
"I've got a couple pairs here at the studio."
"So normal pair of wired headphones,"
"just think about like your Beats or ATH-M50s"
"might have 20-50 Ohms impedance."
"The high impedance headphones can go well over a 100 Ohms."
"And so they won't really sound like much."
"They'll be very low in volume if you plug them"
"into almost anything with a headphone jack."
"And so people who use these headphones will have to carry"
"an external Thunderbolt deck,"
"just a little thing to plug in."
"And so if these headphone jacks are high powered enough,"
"in theory, that's one less dongle you have to carry, right?"
"So for my audiophiles out there,"
"the pre-amps here are impressive"
"and there are definitely pushing out more power,"
"but this isn't some incredible, super clean deck"
"or anything crazy."
"With these Beyerdynamic DT 770 PROs for example,"
"which are 250 ohm headphones, MacBook Pro M1"
"at absolutely maxed out hundred percent volume"
"sounded comfortable."
"And these new MacBook Pros hit that same level"
"at about 65% volume."
"So there was an improvement."
"They don't sound better than the dedicated amp"
"you would have to bring, but in a pinch,"
"if you've only brought one pair of headphones,"
"you can plug them in straight."
"And that's kind of neat,"
"which is just saving you a dongle."
"And that's kind of the theme of all of these ports,"
"to be honest, like the HDMI port is only actually HDMI 2.0,"
"not 2.1, I don't know why."
"And it's kind of annoying that such an expensive computer"
"doesn't have the latest, highest end part,"
"but HDMI 2.0 still does 4K 60."
"So it's great for any projector or TV."
"It's good in a pinch, one less dongle."
"The SD card slot is XDXC."
"It's only UHS-2 speeds."
"So it doesn't support the newer faster UHS-3"
"but UHS-2 is still 300 megabytes per second."
"That's pretty good in a pinch, one less dongle."
"So it's an expensive computer."
"I could have easily had the higher end ports."
"It's definitely a knock on them, but like I said,"
"it's kind of just like the convenient in a pinch type thing."
"And you know what?"
"I might as well since we're talking ports,"
"you know what would've been cool?"
"EtherNet on the power brick."
"Remember what they did with the M1 iMac"
"where they have like gigabit ethernet built into the brick."
"I think MacBook Pro users would be more likely to want"
"ethernet without a dongle on the laptop like they did here,"
"but they didn't."
"But anyway, there's just something hilarious"
"about them going backwards on the last four years"
"of MacBook Pros and actually adding ports back to it."
"It's not something they do all the time."
"So I'm giving a thumbs up on that."
"Speaking of going backwards though, no touch bar."
"So there's a new keyboard on these MacBook Pros"
"and it's all buttons, all real physical keys."
"So they've replaced the touch bar with a full row,"
"full height, physical function keys at the top."
"It's really a shame the touch bar never reached"
"its full potential and I'll miss the like two times"
"I thought it was useful with audio fitting shortcuts inside"
"Final Cut Pro or fast-forwarding scrubbing through Instagram"
"videos on the desktop, but these buttons really are better."
"And the whole keyboard is an improvement"
"from previous year's too."
"It's backlit, the keys feel good and travel decently well"
"like their keyboards from five years ago,"
"the touch ID button in the corner works super quickly"
"and reliably and it's subtle,"
"but the whole keyboard is inset in this black,"
"anodized rectangle and I love it."
"It's a nice touch."
"Black keys will definitely still show fingerprints"
"and a little bit of skin oils"
"more than the lighter keyboards out there on other machines,"
"but I'm willing to deal with that."
"The speakers absolutely incredible,"
"especially on the 16 inch, still the biggest, fullest,"
"best speakers I've ever heard in a laptop on the bigger one."
"And the studio microphones are also now improved,"
"but that brings us to the front of this laptop."
"So let's talk about the front."
"So these new displays are on paper and in real life,"
"pretty incredible."
"They are 10 bit panels."
"They're mini LED, HDR, 16 x 10,"
"almost 4K high refresh rate displays."
"I mean, it's just all of the boxes checked"
"and then there's the notch up top."
"Okay so the screens are amazing."
"It's basically a mini pro display XDR,"
"but with even higher pixel density and higher refresh rate,"
"I mean it doesn't look that different"
"from previous MacBook Pros."
"Most of the time you're using it,"
"but it does hit that 1600-nits max brightness while watching"
"HDR content, which is awesome."
"And the thinner bezels all the way around"
"were long overdue and underneath the menu bar,"
"I'm also happy that it is still,"
"it's the taller 16 x 10 aspect ratio."
"And then ProMotion is interesting."
"So we know this as the adaptive refresh rate."
"It's not always maxing out here at 120 Hertz,"
"even when flying around the UI,"
"Max, we're already decently smooth at 60,"
"but I can tell this is not going to 120 Hertz all the time."
"So like scrolling in Safari, for example."
"Apparently Safari still needs an update"
"to support the highest of this adaptive frame rate."
"But there are a couple areas where you really notice"
"a higher refresh rate."
"I mean, moving your mouse around a lot,"
"moving a lot of bigger animations,"
"like swiping between spaces and other big flowy stuff"
"like the genie animation for minimizing that stuff."
"I mean, it's awesome."
"Moving around a Final Cut timeline."
"That's very smooth too."
"That's where the higher frame rate is noticeable"
"and the extra smoothness is appreciated."
"So this isn't the first mini LED display."
"This isn't the first HDR laptop ever."
"It's definitely not the first high refresh rate screen"
"in a laptop, but just combining all of these things,"
"the 10-bit display the thinner bezels, all of it,"
"it is a great display."
"So let's talk about the top notch design, shall we?"
"There's only a few things up here in the notch."
"It's the new 1080P webcam,"
"which looks perfectly decent now,"
"thanks for catching up Apple."
"And there's a little ambient light sensor"
"and a little LED light, and that's pretty much it."
"There's no way the notch needed to be this big"
"for that hardware."
"I mean, I'll wait for the iFixit teardown,"
"but there's no way you needed this much space."
"So it's an odd choice."
"And it's really easy to complain about this"
"when you're not actually using the laptop, but two things."
"One, I think Apple is actually finding this"
"to be like a part of their design language now."
"Like this is a recognizable laptop silhouette"
"because of the notch."
"However, we feel about that, it is what it is,"
"but then also turns out it's okay to put a notch right here"
"in the part of the screen"
"that you really don't notice very much"
"when you're actually using a laptop."
"The mouse goes underneath it for those who are wondering,"
"and the software seems to basically treat"
"the screen like there is no notch."
"Like if you take a screenshot or do a screen recording,"
"it's still drawing the display there with all of its pixels."
"And anytime you go full screen with anything,"
"it just turns the entire menu bar black."
"And it looks like the bezel at the top basically"
"gets slightly thicker and it's very deep black"
"with the mini LED."
"The notch literally never cuts into any content."
"Basically think of it as cutting into the extra display"
"that you actually didn't have before."
"And they've just shoved the menu bar up there"
"into that extra display."
"You know, there are some weird quirks when you have an app"
"with enough menu bar items,"
"it runs those things right underneath the notch"
"and things clearly to be patched up with a software update,"
"maybe making them scrollable or like adding"
"an expansion button or something like that."
"So at this point it's like,"
"oh, people are making the custom apps"
"to totally black out the top part of the display"
"to hide the notch, which I mean,"
"if you hate it that much sure you have that option."
"But like I promise you when you actually start using"
"the laptop and you're in apps and thing's full screen,"
"it never cuts anything off."
"Like you're paying attention to what's on the screen."
"It disappears even more than it did"
"on the smaller screen of the phones."
"But that being said, if the next version of this laptop"
"still has a notch this big and doesn't add face ID,"
"I'll wear socks and sandals for a day like Linus."
"They gotta be planning on putting"
"it there eventually, right?"
"It almost feels useless to talk about how it feels"
"just spinning around Mac OS Monterrey,"
"because of course, it's fine."
"Like I got the improved notification management,"
"it's got the rounded corners up top."
"It's got the quick, mouse-over at the bottom corner"
"to get to Quick Notes."
"We get all that, those nice features,"
"but we're here for the performance."
"We want to know if it's actually as great as those graphs,"
"Apple suggested at the Apple event."
"Spoiler alert. They're both really that good."
"So I've got a couple of different specs here."
"This is the M1 Pro in the 14 inch."
"I've also got a maxed out 16 inch that I've been testing."
"So I get to the differences between M1 Max and M1 Pro"
"and all that in a second, but just know that yeah,"
"they are very, very good."
"So when it comes to performance benchmarks,"
"I feel like everyone's more or less looking"
"for the perfect benchmark out there"
"that will confirm to them"
"that it will work best for their own workflow."
"Like I said, these are tools and from what I've seen,"
"it feels like that benchmark result exists"
"for pretty much every use case so far for these."
"So as far as synthetic benchmarks,"
"it dropped the highest single score Geekbench CPU score"
"I've ever seen from any Mac."
"And multi-core lined it up right around the maxed out"
"18 core iMac."
"I also ran it through Cinebench"
"and it had, again, very impressive single core scores,"
"and here's how the multi-core stacks up."
"But when I say, when I tell you these laptops"
"are next level, I mean that"
"because the real world performance"
"and the real world capabilities of these laptops"
"is dramatically better than they have any business doing."
"So obviously we know about the way higher memory bandwidth."
"We know about the way higher number of GPU cores."
"And I love the 10, 15, 25% improvements that come across"
"the board with all of that stuff."
"The vertical integration worked right?"
"But there are parts of this chip that Apple has built"
"with specific purposes in mind."
"And for those purposes, it's next level."
"So these laptop chips have a media engine"
"and there's a ProRes accelerator as part of that."
"M1 Max has two of them."
"Video professionals, you can see"
"where we're going with this."
"Working with ProRes at all with these laptops"
"is dramatically better."
"I think an example was like encoding a video with compressor"
"is 10 times as fast as it was with the Intel MacBook Pros."
"That's the next level. So like I said, these laptops are,"
"that's why they got me excited."
"I work with video too."
"So let's see how it does with Final Cut Pro."
"So as I mentioned, I did edit the last video,"
"the entire AirPods 3 review"
"on the 16 inch M1 Max Mac Book Pro in various locations,"
"both around the studio and at home,"
"plugged in and on battery."
"And it handled it incredibly well like shockingly well."
"Keep in mind, this is 8K REDCODE raw footage."
"It's a mix of low and medium compression shots"
"from the V-RAPTOR."
"And I'm able to bend the color and raw data"
"and move all around the timeline and chop everything up"
"pretty quickly and seamlessly without hiccups,"
"just like on the desktop, on the Mac Pro."
"So playback was in high quality instead of high performance."
"So I'm getting a ton of resolution and really only dropping"
"a couple of frames here and there"
"again, just like the Mac Pro."
"One of my ways to measure if a machine is choking"
"or struggling at all is like how long the delay is"
"between pressing the play button,"
"the space bar on unrendered footage."
"And when it actually starts to play back,"
"and this delay, as you can see it's like less"
"than a quarter of a second."
"That's as good as I've ever seen it in Final Cut."
"So the only thing that's caused me any concern was that"
"a couple of times the audio waveform previews"
"took longer to load when I was pinching and zooming"
"into parts of the timeline."
"And I suspect that's RAM related."
"Of course, M1 Max only has 64 gigs of RAM"
"versus the Mac Pro I've edited on has 768 gigs of RAM."
"So it makes sense that I saw a difference there,"
"but when the edit was finished"
"and it came time to export it,"
"I of course, just for fun, copied the project"
"across to multiple computers"
"and just did the same export on all of them"
"to see how it went."
"So the M1 Pro Mac Book Pro, the 14 inch,"
"exported the whole thing in 6 minutes and 40 seconds."
"It's pretty good."
"The $50,000 28-core Mac Pro did the same thing"
"in five minutes and 42 seconds."
"And then the M1 Max Mac Pro or MacBook Pro,"
"did it in four minutes and six seconds."
"So the Mac Book Pro beat the Mac Pro"
"handily at exporting the project."
"And it's not even like export times really matter"
"all that much at this level,"
"four minutes, five minutes, whatever."
"But the fact that it beat the Mac Pro already is ridiculous."
"And I also did that while not plugged in,"
"which doesn't lose any performance on battery."
"And the battery dropped 2% from 96 to 94% while exporting."
"So you might've heard"
"there's different performance profiles."
"And this is true on the 16 inch MacBook Pro"
"was interesting playing with these."
"Most of the time, I just left it on automatic"
"because it would just do its thing, no hiccups at all,"
"and I could edit fine."
"But when I went to go export just for fun,"
"I turned on the 16 inches high power mode,"
"which in theory should let the chips run full throttle,"
"more often, spin up the fans a little bit more, et cetera."
"I still never heard the fans ever,"
"but the export time was even faster,"
"three minutes and 49 seconds, Jesus."
"And on top of all of that,"
"the plugin suite that I use Motion VFX,"
"is updating steadily all their stuff"
"to support Apple Silicon, which is great."
"At this point honestly, I think it's a no brainer."
"The Travel iMac is now retired."
"I can safely edit everything on a laptop,"
"but Final Cut Pro is just one use case."
"There's plenty of other stuff."
"If you watch The Verge's review,"
"they did a lot of Adobe stuff and you can check out their"
"incredible findings with the newest version"
"of After Effects really finally taking advantage"
"of multithreaded GPU rendering."
"They also showed it outperforming the mobile RTX 3080"
"when editing in Premiere."
"And there are some glowing reviews for music producers"
"and sound designers who love having a whisper"
"silent computer that can also process way more audio effects"
"and that they can take with them."
"And Tyler Stalman did a great video,"
"reviewing the laptop for photographers,"
"where the M1 Max's laptop is importing and generating"
"previews, et cetera, twice as fast as a 2018 MacBook Pro."
"And he also opens up every single app at once"
"and streams a bunch of ProRes videos all simultaneously"
"next to each other, and you guessed it."
"It doesn't even blink."
"And then there's also a great tweet"
"from a staff engineer at Reddit."
"The machine is cutting build times for their Android app"
"in half and a little napkin math says"
"that buying a team of them, a bunch of these laptops,"
"would end up saving them a lot more money than they'd spent."
"Basically these experiences are of course,"
"all dependent on the apps you use as a professional"
"and how optimized they are."
"All of Apple's apps are the first ones to be updated"
"right out the box."
"So Final cut Pro that I use is great, but over time,"
"more of them will continue to be updated"
"and see those gains as well."
"And I didn't even talk about battery life,"
"but it does all of this high-performance stuff"
"while also being incredibly efficient."
"So you have the fast charging already if you want it."
"But I found that the 16-inch with the 100-watt hour"
"battery lasts a bit longer than the 14 inch"
"with a 70-watt hour battery and M1 Pro"
"will last a bit longer than M1 Max."
"It turns out those GPU cores do run a little bit hotter"
"and use more power."
"But ultimately if you want the longest possible battery"
"life, that would be 16 inch M1 Pro."
"Nevertheless, they all get around the same battery life"
"I've found as the M1 MacBook Pro,"
"which is to say all day best in class."
"You can still kill it in like four hours"
"if you're just sitting on battery editing video"
"in high power mode the whole time, then yeah,"
"then you can crush it."
"But again, the fast charging turns out to be very useful."
"So, you know what? Here's the recommendation."
"If you are a professional that works on your laptop"
"and you're on an older version,"
"or you find yourself reaching the limits of one of these,"
"and you're thinking maybe you should try"
"to look at one of these new MacBook Pros."
"I feel very confident saying, yeah,"
"you could pick one up and be very, very happy."
"I think the real choice is between M1 Pro and M1 Max"
"and 14 inch and 16 inch."
"Now for me, I'm going with a 16 inch M1 Max,"
"just because I take advantage of the extra GPU cores."
"And I wish I could go with the 14 inch maxed out,"
"which you can max out to the same exact specs"
"as a 16 inch with maybe just small thermal differences,"
"they'll perform about the same,"
"but I really like having the bigger screen"
"for editing video."
"So I'm going maxed out big laptop."
"So then for M1 Pro versus M1 Max."
"M1 Max is the most powerful,"
"but it does nick a bit of your battery life."
"So I would upgrade only if you need those extra GPU cores"
"and you'll know if your app supported."
"And I won't even pretend to game on a Mac."
"Some people do though."
"And if you do theoretically, the M1 Max"
"would also handle that better."
"But like I said from the beginning,"
"this is a tool and it happens to be a really,"
"really good tool at what it does."
"And it happens to be next level at a couple specific things"
"that it's been designed and optimized for."
"So there's gonna be a lot of professionals like me"
"who are really happy with these."
"There's also gonna be a lot of people"
"who totally don't need this power,"
"but just have a lot of money to spend"
"and just want to get a nice laptop."
"And it is a nice laptop."
"So I wouldn't blame you."
"That's fine too, but I'm just happy"
"I can finally say that this is,"
"I will be editing videos on a laptop,"
"which is that's awesome."
"And yeah, I haven't been able to say something's"
"truly next level in a really long time, but these are."
"It's one of my favorite products of the year, to be honest."
"I also really, really can't wait until"
"the Apple Silicon Mac Pro desktop,"
"that thing's gonna be wild."
"Either way, that's been it for the review of the laptops."
"Thanks for watching."
"Catch you guys in the next one, peace."
"(conclusion chiming)"
"hey everyone tim scofield here and we"
"got our hands on the new macbook pro"
"which features the first processor from"
"apple silicon this has the m1 processor"
"inside and i have to say if this"
"processor is as good as apple makes it"
"sound like intel and amd should be"
"getting a little worried now apple has"
"already shown on their iphones and ipads"
"that they can make their hardware and"
"software work fairly seamlessly and now"
"that they control the processor they can"
"pair it up with mac os and again i think"
"it will be a fairly seamless experience"
"anyways we are going to unbox the new"
"macbook pro show you real quick what"
"comes inside and then of course boot it"
"up get some hands on with this new"
"laptop let's get started funny enough"
"after i just shot that intro i got"
"another package delivery so the mac mini"
"is here stay tuned for a video on that"
"be sure to subscribe so you're notified"
"but they also dropped off the other"
"color of the macbook pro so we're going"
"to be able to take a look at both the"
"space gray and silver now if there's"
"anything you'd like to see in an"
"upcoming video be sure to drop a comment"
"let me know about these m1 chip laptops"
"now on the box you'll see the different"
"colors have different colored"
"backgrounds but also i did get the eight"
"gigabyte model with the space gray and"
"the silver model has 16 gigs of ram so i"
"can kind of compare those two in terms"
"of ram also notice on the box the silver"
"has more of silver writing whereas a"
"little bit darker on the space gray so"
"let's begin with the unboxing see what"
"we get inside this would be the silver"
"macbook pro a little bit chilly actually"
"i'm going to set that to the side for"
"now let's see what else we get designed"
"by apple in california these should just"
"be some booklets so you'll see macbook"
"pro your getting started welcome guide"
"some extra information and there should"
"have been stickers yes there they are so"
"there are apple stickers inside might be"
"a different color depending on what"
"model you get i'll open up the other box"
"and compare believe it or not inside you"
"do get a charging brick and this is a 61"
"watt usbc power adapter it has an apple"
"logo etched into the side it is usb type"
"c and in case you're wondering the"
"prongs do pop out and also this piece"
"does detach from the adapter and finally"
"your usbc to usbc cable for charging or"
"data transfer this is actually two"
"meters long which is just over six and a"
"half feet and that's everything that"
"came in the box you will get the exact"
"same stuff in the space gray model"
"besides the stickers i was right so the"
"stickers are actually a different color"
"the ones on the right are silver and"
"these are the more space gray colored"
"stickers on the left all right onto the"
"macbook pro let's go ahead and take this"
"plastic off the silver model i also want"
"to make a note that this silver model"
"has a two terabyte ssd"
"inside whereas the space gray model that"
"i got only has 512 gigs so the the"
"silver model is definitely the highest"
"end macbook pro you can get with the m1"
"chip right now and don't worry you can"
"get the same config in the space grey i"
"just happen to choose it on the silver"
"model so here is a look a side-by-side"
"look at the two different colors pretty"
"classic color choices from apple let's"
"take a close look so on the left side is"
"where the two usbc slots are it is"
"thunderbolt usb 4 connection and then"
"moving along this is the 13.3 inch"
"model by the way there's a look at the"
"front with a slot for your finger to"
"open it up and on the right side is only"
"a headphone jack you would have liked to"
"have seen more usbc ports just a little"
"bit of a bummer in my opinion on the"
"back you will see there is some"
"ventilation and just a comparison of the"
"bottom there are these black grips in"
"all four corners another quick"
"difference in the colors that's a little"
"bit harder to notice is that the apple"
"logo is a little bit darker tinted"
"on the space gray whereas the silver"
"seems like a straight up mirror and a"
"little bit more of a tint to the space"
"gray logo all right let's open up the"
"laptop with the one-handed test passed"
"with ease so you can easily open it up"
"and there's that classic apple sound"
"let's let's hear that again on the space"
"gray"
"so we are on the startup screen i'm"
"gonna run through the setup process and"
"only talk about anything that's"
"noteworthy it does prompt you for"
"accessibility settings i'd recommend"
"going through all of them in case"
"there's some that you'd like to turn on"
"maybe you want to turn on some closed"
"captions uh under cognitive you can"
"change it from light to dark mode or"
"have it's turned on auto which i"
"actually like so i switched it over to"
"auto you can have speak selection typing"
"feedback hover text there's a lot of"
"great accessibility options in here you"
"do have the option to transfer info from"
"a mac time machine backup startup disk"
"or a windows pc we're going to set up as"
"fresh for now next to the touch bar up"
"at the top is your power button which"
"also couples as a fingerprint scanner"
"for touch id so to set that up just set"
"your finger down lift it on up and"
"continue through"
"capture some of the edges of your"
"fingerprint from my experience this"
"fingerprint scanner is very fast"
"accurate it gives you an example of what"
"the display looks like without true tone"
"display which i prefer to have off i"
"wish i could just turn it off right now"
"but i have to actually go into system"
"preferences once i skip through the"
"setup process to turn it off and we are"
"all the way through the startup process"
"on our home screen this is mac os big"
"sur with their very colorful bubbly"
"icons let's go into about this mac there"
"is big sur you'll notice it says apple"
"m1 and 16 gigabytes of ram then if we go"
"over to storage there is two terabytes"
"so out of the box"
"1.97 terabytes available out of the two"
"in display settings this has a 13.3 inch"
"by"
"1600 retina display now this is my first"
"time actually seeing big sur i haven't"
"updated any of my macs to it just yet so"
"i'm pretty excited to actually dive into"
"this os"
"now let's go ahead and actually maybe"
"run a benchmark or two i'd also like to"
"let's go into safari very quickly and"
"maybe do a quick search for cinebench"
"just so you can kind of see it running"
"through"
"there's cinebench"
"and i'd actually like to switch windows"
"and open up the app store"
"these are all the first time i'm opening"
"these apps as a quick side note so not"
"only do i want to run a quick benchmark"
"i'll actually also render some 4k video"
"footage in final cut pro because that is"
"what i use to edit my videos so let me"
"get that installed so final cut pro is"
"installed however before we even open"
"that i'd like to run a cinebench but"
"just keep in mind that i did just boot"
"this up for the first time and just"
"signed in and nothing is really fully"
"transferred over or installed yet all"
"right so let's run the benchmark i will"
"let you know the results"
"all right as our test finishes up let's"
"take a look and see what the final score"
"is i do want to make a note that the fan"
"actually did turn on"
"and it really wasn't that loud you could"
"barely hear it when i sat at a normal"
"distance from the laptop there we go"
"7770 let's begin the single core"
"test and the single core benchmark just"
"finished at"
"15.05 and i did not hear the fan turn on"
"with this test and keep in mind this is"
"apple's baseline processor for apple"
"silicon now let's open up final cut pro"
"and actually get some 4k video files on"
"the macbook pro and render out some"
"video and check it out right when you"
"open up final cut pro for the first time"
"it is optimized for apple silicon so it"
"is already having improved performance"
"and efficiency on mac computers with"
"apple silicon so we've got our files"
"transferred over let's just do a real"
"quick test let's start a new project"
"call it test"
"import media and once we allow it access"
"let's go into test and select all"
"and hit import selected and they are all"
"ready to go that was actually really"
"quick uh importing those files now let's"
"throw some of the video files into the"
"timeline to kind of give you an idea of"
"how quick or laggy that it actually will"
"be uh so far so good and in comparison"
"to be honest i've been using my"
"2016 macbook pro my 15 inch macbook pro"
"for a while now for video editing so"
"this does feel"
"fast and snappy here's a little bit of"
"you know scrubbing on some video seems"
"to be very accurate uh and precise with"
"it all right so with no edits made here"
"is about a 10 minute video of just 4k"
"video footage so let's export that and"
"see how long it takes for us as a side"
"note i'm not going to render this in"
"prores we're just going to do h.264"
"all right and there it is finished at"
"about nine minutes 30 seconds for like i"
"mentioned a 10 minute 4k video no real"
"major edits or anything going on but uh"
"yeah so just about a 10 minute video all"
"ready to go in nine and a half minutes"
"that's actually very impressive uh and"
"and really cool to see actually from"
"apple now keep in mind this is a fresh"
"computer with not many apps installed"
"anything like that so after all that"
"testing this is very promising now i"
"will be using it more of a desktop i'll"
"connect it to a monitor use it in that"
"way so a lot more testing coming soon"
"again drop a comment let me know if"
"there's anything in particular"
"you have questions about or anything you"
"want me to cover in an upcoming video"
"anyways be sure to subscribe a lot more"
"m1 coverage with the mac mini macbook"
"pros coming very soon be sure to give"
"this video a thumbs up and as always"
"guys thank you very much for watching"
"so the internet is filled right now with"
"people positively spaffing themselves"
"demented all over that new apple silicon"
"now seriously there's so much fappage"
"friction going on right now that i'm"
"kind of concerned that the entire web is"
"just going to spontaneously combust"
"but is apple's new all-in-one m1 chipset"
"really"
"as spooge-worthy as everyone seems to"
"make out well to find out i grabbed one"
"of the 16 gigabyte models of the new"
"macbook pro with apple's m1 chip"
"that's almost 2 000 quids worth a kit"
"and that came straight out of my whiskey"
"fund and you know how"
"much i love whiskey kitties for 1 900"
"bob i could have bought"
"a lot of whiskey so for the last several"
"weeks in between my other laptop reviews"
"i've been using the macbook pro"
"m1 to be doing pretty much everything"
"video editing photo"
"and script and all that good stuff so is"
"it actually worthy"
"of all of that praise well here's my"
"real world macbook pro"
"m1 review and from all the latest"
"greatest tech please do plug subscribe"
"and hitting that notifications bell"
"cheers so let's start with the design"
"and anyone who's bought a macbook pro"
"these last few years will really be"
"struggling to see any proper external"
"differences with the m1 model"
"it's definitely a real shame that given"
"the changes that have taken place inside"
"of the macbooks that apple didn't take"
"the opportunity to also freshen up the"
"design on the outside and really"
"differentiate these new"
"m1 laptops from the older intel models"
"but then the aesthetical part of design"
"doesn't seem something that apple's"
"really concerning itself with"
"much these days i mean have you seen the"
"new iphones i mean"
"my kid has a barbie phone that looks"
"more legit than this thing regardless"
"though that metallic chassis is at least"
"as robust as ever proven well up to a"
"life on the road"
"and while this 13-incher is seriously"
"hefty compared with dell's rivals for"
"instance"
"at least it's kind of compact for a"
"professional laptop of course one issue"
"with the smaller laptops is definitely"
"the limited space for ports and that is"
"certainly a weakness here"
"the macbook pro m1 serves up a pair of"
"thunderbolt 3 ports sadly not the fresh"
"new thunderbolt 4"
"as found on the new tiger leg version of"
"the xps 13"
"and a lot of hp lenovo and azusa's new"
"laptops"
"although that's only really an issue if"
"you want to get a dock connected to your"
"macbook pro in order to hook up a lot of"
"peripherals and different drives and"
"things like that"
"sadly both of those thunderbolts are"
"crammed together on the left edge which"
"is less than ideal but it is a minor"
"grumble at best so"
"suck it up junior moving on you've got"
"that now standard combination of"
"keyboard and touch bar"
"and so far i'm more than happy with this"
"this is apple's so-called"
"magic keyboard and the magic part of it"
"is that all of the keys still actually"
"work"
"two months later that's definitely a"
"massive improvement of my old 2017"
"macbook pro wear and i wish i was"
"kidding here"
"by now the space bar had already started"
"packing up"
"this keyboard offers a very comfortable"
"typing experience the keys have got a"
"good bit of bounce but they don't feel"
"spongy and they're very well sized for"
"touch typing"
"adding some excellent backlighting and"
"you've got a solid all-around board"
"and it's the same story for the macbook"
"pro's touch id sensor built into"
"that power button as well once again"
"this works with charm fast and"
"responsive as always"
"likewise the touch bar is a lively"
"dynamic alternative to function keys"
"that's really coming into its own now"
"that devs have had a bit of time"
"to make use of it it's a fast and easy"
"way to control your media"
"adjust the display brightness all that"
"good stuff and also access essential"
"features when you're using apps"
"and that spacious touchpad is definitely"
"another winner admirably filling that"
"palm rest"
"to the full extent it did take me a"
"little while to get used to apple's dual"
"click"
"methods you just got to push softly for"
"a left click and then push harder for a"
"right click but once this method"
"clicks sort of speak then it all just"
"works perfectly and no complaints either"
"when it comes to that 13.3 inch"
"ips display the 2560 by 1600 pixel"
"resolution means everything looks pin"
"sharp and despite that compact design i"
"thought i could still comfortably edit"
"photos and video"
"or enjoy some depressing real-life"
"murder documentaries to further sink"
"into my 2020 funk"
"colour reproduction is typically natural"
"which is ideal for creative use"
"100 of the srgb and an impressive 86"
"of the adobe rgb are ably handled plus"
"the maximum brightness tops off at 480"
"nits which is more than strong enough to"
"comfortably work out doors"
"you've got full dolby atmos support here"
"and those stereo speakers pump out a"
"decent"
"beefy bit of audio once you pump the"
"volume all the way up you've also got a"
"headphone jack hazard plus some reliable"
"bluetooth support for gold wire free now"
"if you want to do some zoom in or"
"whatever to actually see your friends"
"and family at some point you've got a"
"perfectly bold standard 720p"
"hd webcam stuck there above the screen"
"it doesn't have a privacy shield or"
"anything like that when it's not in use"
"but you do at least get this dinky"
"little green led which pops into"
"life whenever the camera is being used"
"by an application just in case you know"
"you want to get up to something dodgy"
"and you're having to completely forget"
"that you're live streaming to the"
"internet"
"and as you can see the picture quality"
"as standard for this sort of laptop is"
"generally kind of sort of soft"
"and grainy and it is thrown by harsh"
"lighting as well but it'll do the job"
"for a basic web chat"
"as for that built-in mic well it's okay"
"but you will have to speak up to be"
"properly heard and it also picks up on"
"all the background noise going on around"
"you so i'd highly recommend"
"using an actual proper headset but of"
"course the whole reason i was so"
"curious about the new apple macbook pro"
"was that"
"m1 chipset which apple has crafted in"
"collaboration with arm"
"ever since the launch apple has been"
"absolutely brazen its own beef about the"
"performance"
"of this m1 chipset claiming that these"
"new macbook devices are more powerful"
"than 98"
"of all windows laptops out there and"
"unsurprisingly"
"that's not true so if you're using a"
"program that is actually optimized for"
"that m1 chip then they"
"tend to run well here on this 16 gig"
"macbook pro"
"but certainly not all of them run"
"perfectly in final cut pro for instance"
"i was constantly seeing dropped frames"
"when editing just a single stream of 4k"
"video and that's without adding any"
"fancy extra elements"
"and that seems to be because i shoot in"
"the standard mpeg format rather than"
"apple's own pro"
"res format and that's so i can actually"
"edit using a variety of software"
"and devices when needed so lesson one is"
"this kiddies unless you play"
"absolutely by apple's rules using only"
"m1 optimized software and using only"
"apple's own format you can expect to see"
"judders and shonky behavior"
"from these new macbooks i tried using"
"software like [ __ ] and was absolutely"
"appalled at the so-called performance"
"even quite basic windows laptops like"
"microsoft's surface laptop go which i"
"only recently reviewed offered a"
"smoother experience at a third of the"
"cost"
"although at least fairly demanding games"
"ran with a respectable ish enough frame"
"rate on the macbook pro m1 as long as i"
"kept the graphics settings low"
"but those detail levels up high and"
"everything usually becomes a hot god"
"damn mess"
"and as a rough indicator of performance"
"on the default high settings on rise of"
"the tomb raider the macbook churned out"
"average frame rate of 27"
"21 and just 23 frames per second with"
"noticeable drops throughout"
"the one key area where i did actually"
"notice a performance increase on the"
"macbook pro m1 compared with my older"
"2017"
"macbook pro is the video processing"
"speed on this thing"
"you can get a video processed in about"
"sort of three or four minutes compared"
"with around 15 to 20 minutes"
"on the older device so again as long as"
"you temper your expectations and use the"
"macbook pro m1"
"exactly how apple expects you to then"
"all is gravy but to be honest if you've"
"got a macbook pro from the last three"
"four years with the radiant graphics"
"then i wouldn't rush to upgrade anytime"
"soon as for the mac os experience well"
"big sur has proven reasonably stable so"
"far only crashing a couple of times in"
"the past two months"
"it's an incremental update of course"
"with a few little aesthetic tweaks"
"thrown in and of course the ability to"
"run ipad apps if you"
"ever feel the need the new control panel"
"effort is mostly redundant as a lot of"
"those features can be fast accessed on"
"the touch bar but it will please those"
"with older machines"
"however i'm definitely not a fan of how"
"you can't uninstall quite a lot of"
"apple's pre-installed apps including the"
"likes of chess"
"not exactly a vital piece of software"
"for the overall running of the macbook"
"you'd have thought"
"and yeah queen's gambit might have been"
"a pretty decent show but it hasn't"
"exactly inspired me to go play"
"virtual [ __ ] chess on my macbook all"
"the time thankfully i've had bugger all"
"issues when it comes to the internet"
"connectivity on the macbook pro"
"m1 though thanks for that dependable"
"wi-fi 6 support i've actually seen some"
"really nippy upload and download speeds"
"which is obviously great when you're"
"dealing with whop and great files going"
"onto youtube and stuff like that"
"as for the storage well the base model"
"of the macbook"
"pro m1 comes with a measly 256 gigs on"
"board which when you're video editing is"
"about as useful as a condom machine in a"
"nunnery so i naturally said bollocks to"
"that and sparked up another 400 quid"
"roughly 10"
"bottles of your finest 12 year old malt"
"on the one terabyte version"
"and this registered read speeds just"
"over 3 gigabits per second"
"and just under that for writing files"
"which is a solid effort overall"
"comparable to rivals like the dell xps"
"13. and i gotta say while my"
"expectations certainly weren't met on"
"the performance front mostly thanks to"
"apple's ridiculous boss"
"and the ceaseless parotin online the"
"macbook pro m1 definitely did impress me"
"when it came to the battery life i found"
"that even when i was video editing"
"in final cut pro i would get around nine"
"hours of non-stop use from a single"
"charge and again when i was working in"
"the likes of google chrome i used to do"
"a bit"
"scripting or whatever while streaming"
"media again i would get around sort of"
"nine"
"hours of use which is definitely better"
"than most windows rivals"
"and so after actually using the apple"
"macbook pro m1 as my full-time laptop"
"in between other reviews naturally would"
"i recommend it to"
"fine fork well i know i've dumped on it"
"from a great height quite a bit"
"in this review but that's only because"
"my expectations were rather high"
"because of apple itself and naturally"
"the echo chamber that is the internet"
"the fact of the matter is the macbook"
"pro m1 is a perfectly fine"
"creative laptop especially thanks to the"
"fantastic battery life"
"on this thing definitely really handy if"
"you want to be editing on the go"
"at some point in 2021 when we can"
"actually leave our houses again and the"
"performance is good"
"as i stated before if you actually stick"
"to apple's own rulebook but if you want"
"to be using third-party software and the"
"like you're not going to get any"
"benefits from the m1 that you wouldn't"
"get from much cheaper windows devices"
"so that's what i personally think of the"
"macbook pro m1 would be great to hear"
"from you five volk as well though"
"definitely please uh leave your"
"experiences down"
"in the comments below any little foibles"
"that you've found or if you've been"
"absolutely loving"
"every minute of it be great to hear from"
"you and please do poke subscribe and"
"ding that notifications bell for more"
"on the latest greatest sec cheers love"
"you"

"foreign"
"okay so i just came back from the apple"
"store with the brand new empty macbook"
"pro and"
"obviously this is the most underwhelming"
"product from the apple event but i do"
"want to try a few things i want to see"
"if the speakers are any different and"
"the microphones the camera and most"
"importantly i want to see the"
"performance of that m2 chip but first"
"let's quickly unbox it the wallpapers"
"are technically the same the reason why"
"this one looks different is because this"
"is the silver whereas this is the box of"
"the space gray but if you look at images"
"of the silver boxes for the m1 they"
"actually haven't changed the wallpaper"
"at all it's the same box i want to see"
"if there's anything different inside the"
"box if we get any changes in terms of"
"the manual or the accessories so i've"
"had a look at all the accessories and"
"everything is exactly the same as on the"
"m1 model with one exception and that is"
"the charger so there's a new charger"
"which has 67 watts of power delivery"
"compared to 61 watts which is what the"
"m1 model have in fact this is actually"
"the exact same charger that we get with"
"the base 14 inch macbook pro more about"
"the empty macbook pro right after this"
"this video is sponsored by banverg and"
"their luxury line of apple accessories"
"including premium maxi phone cases"
"bespoke watch straps in a variety of"
"styles and the perfect air tag keyrings"
"they can even use the same material for"
"multiple items so that you have all of"
"them matching perfectly check out"
"bandwick's lineup by using the link"
"below and now back to the video so that"
"was the unboxing now let's get to the"
"testing and these are the three macbooks"
"that i want to test the bass m2 the bass"
"m1 and the bass 14-inch okay so this is"
"a microphone and a camera test on the m1"
"13-inch macbook pro and now this is the"
"m2 13-inch macbook pro"
"the sensor is exactly the same but the"
"image processing might be a bit"
"different because of that m2 chip so let"
"me know if you see any improvements over"
"the m1 and now this is the 14 inch m1"
"pro macbook pro this should be the"
"overall best because it does have a"
"1080p sensor compared to 720p on the"
"other ones but maybe the processing is"
"worse than on the m2 so let me know how"
"does this compare to the m2 and the m1"
"now let's do a speaker test and see if"
"there's any differences between the m2"
"and the m1 and also the 14 of course so"
"this is the m1 macbook"
"someone said pro"
"stupid swipe right now i'm watching what"
"you did i put down now i'm at a"
"disadvantage"
"but i think that is"
"[Music]"
"honestly i couldn't hear any difference"
"between the m2 and the m1 of course the"
"40 inch was significantly better so now"
"i want to open up a few apps at the same"
"time and see if there's any difference"
"between the m2 and the m1 i would expect"
"the m2 to be a bit snappier"
"in day-to-day use and we should be able"
"to see that in this test in three two"
"one go"
"so i think the m2 was a tiny bit faster"
"than the m1 but the difference was like"
"very difficult to see and now let's see"
"how it stacks up against the 14 inch in"
"three two one go"
"but to me they looked pretty much the"
"same okay and now i want to do some real"
"world tests and see what the difference"
"actually is between all of these three"
"macbooks so first off i want to test the"
"disk speed to see if there's any"
"differences between the m1 and the m2 i"
"would expect the m2 to maybe be a tiny"
"bit faster than the m1 and wow i am"
"quite surprised because"
"we're getting about one gigabyte to 1.5"
"gigabytes per second slower speeds on"
"the m2 than compared to the m1 now our"
"m1 model does have 512 gigabytes of"
"storage but even when we tested the 256"
"it was actually getting similar speeds"
"to the 512 which means that"
"maybe apple has put in a slower drive"
"inside the m2 macbook pro than we had"
"last year or maybe our model has some"
"sort of issue but we are seeing"
"considerably slower speeds on the m2 and"
"then looking at the 14-inch model we're"
"seeing over five gigabytes per second"
"right and about the same in terms of the"
"read speeds which are about double the"
"ones on the m1 and uh like what four"
"gigabytes per second higher than on the"
"m2 so in blender i rendered the"
"classroom scene using the cycles cpu"
"renderer and the m1 rendered in 14"
"minutes and 24 seconds the m2 in 12"
"minutes and 41 seconds and the m1 pro 14"
"inch in 12 minutes and 12. so the m2 was"
"almost as fast as the m1 pro so even"
"though they have exactly the same core"
"counts the m1 pro has six high"
"performance cores too low performance"
"whereas the m2 has four and four"
"something else that i've noticed was the"
"battery drain so the m1 lost eleven"
"percent the m2 lost ten percent and the"
"m1 pro lost 13 so the m2 was by far the"
"most power efficient out of the three"
"now doing the exact same test but now"
"using the gpu every single machine was"
"considerably faster the m1 took 5"
"minutes and 30 seconds the m2 took 4"
"minutes and 11 seconds and the m1 pro"
"took 3 minutes and 49 seconds the m14"
"lost six percent and then the m2 and the"
"m1 pro both lost four percent so what"
"about video editing well here i have a"
"15 minute 4k h.264 project one of our"
"previous camera comparisons uh this is a"
"very demanding project by the way and"
"the m1 took 1 hour 2 minutes and 57"
"seconds to export the m2 took 44 minutes"
"and 2 seconds so it was considerably"
"faster but then the m1 pro took 16"
"minutes and 18 seconds a huge difference"
"from even the m2 and in terms of the"
"battery drain the m1 lost 35 percent the"
"m2 lost 32 percent and the m1 pro lost"
"18"
"so if you're video editing on a daily"
"basis and you have some complex projects"
"then uh definitely go with the 14 inch"
"then in compressor i'm going to"
"transcode an 8.65 file uh to prores 4k"
"the m1 took 2 minutes and 53 seconds the"
"m2 one minute and 13 seconds so big big"
"difference and the m1 pro took one"
"minute and 14 seconds so the m2 was"
"actually faster than the m1 pro by one"
"second but the interesting thing here is"
"that the m1 lost two percent but the m2"
"and the m1 pro didn't lose any battery"
"at all so it looks like having dedicated"
"hardware engines for this task is not"
"only quicker but also way more power"
"efficient if you do a lot of transcoding"
"then the m2 and the m1 pro would be a"
"big bump from the m1 now when it comes"
"to converting an h.265 file to prores 6k"
"in this case a six minute clip the m1"
"took six minutes and 59 seconds the m2"
"two minutes and two seconds and the m1"
"pro 2 minutes and 19 seconds so the m2"
"was once again faster here but now by a"
"larger margin also the m1 lost four"
"percent m2 2 percent and m1 pro 1"
"okay and now i want to do a logic pro"
"test essentially i have a selection of"
"loads of tracks here and i want to see"
"how many they can each play uh until"
"they crash so for example this is the m1"
"with 68 tracks and as you can see it"
"crashed but if i remove one track"
"now we're at 67"
"it seems like this one can play"
"67 tracks"
"perfectly now on the m2 model i was able"
"to play two more tracks so we have 69"
"tracks in total so very small difference"
"over the m1 and on the bass 14 inch i"
"was able to play 118 tracks which is"
"very interesting because the core count"
"is exactly the same as on the m1 and the"
"m2 so the only difference is the memory"
"in this one this has 16 gigabytes so it"
"seems like the memory does actually help"
"these chips"
"uh play more tracks now let's try some"
"gaming so here i have word of warcraft"
"which is one of the few games that"
"actually run natively on apple silicon"
"so this is the best case scenario the m1"
"pro got 31 frames per second the m2 got"
"41.5 so that's a pretty significant bump"
"and then the m1 pro got 71. okay now in"
"shadow of the tomb raider which is at"
"this point of you know the default mac"
"gaming test if the m1 got 12 frames per"
"second the m2 got 17 and the m1 pro got"
"27. now shadow of the tomb raider does"
"not run natively but it does use apple's"
"metal api so it is more optimized than a"
"lot of the other games and the two extra"
"gpu cores did make a difference in terms"
"of gaming but"
"unfortunately the m1 pro has four more"
"gpu cores than the m2 which are vastly"
"superior so in the end should you get"
"the m2 macbook pro over plus adm1 or"
"even the m1 pro well i think that if you"
"already have an m1 you shouldn't upgrade"
"unless you do transcode a lot of footage"
"because in that case the m2 was"
"significantly faster than the m1 also"
"since apple is not selling the m1"
"macbook pro anymore"
"and you're just looking to buy a new m2"
"mac then this is a pretty good option"
"however if you can find a good deal for"
"a refurbished or a used and one macbook"
"pro then i do think that it should go"
"with that one instead definitely be on"
"the lookout for a 16 gigabyte of ram"
"model uh on ebay or amazon or apple"
"refurbished as that one would give you a"
"tiny performance bump over the standard"
"m1"
"and they would also be more future"
"proofed in the long run now if you do"
"want to buy it brand new the base model"
"is pretty good um i would actually avoid"
"upgrading because the moment you start"
"upgrading this you will actually get"
"very close in price to the 14 inch model"
"from the start there's a 700 difference"
"between the two but if you bump the ramp"
"to 16 gigabytes and the storage to 512"
"to match the 14 inch the 14 inch would"
"only be 300 more in which case i do"
"believe that a 4k inch is definitely"
"worth it you get a significantly better"
"display uh pro motion and mini led you"
"also get more ports and extra"
"thunderbolts max safe fast charging you"
"also get a better keyboard or at least"
"with the lack of touch bar and of course"
"significantly better performance in the"
"graphics department but only do so if"
"you really need that extra performance"
"that's the 14 inch has to offer if you"
"consider yourself a pro"
"then you go with the 14 inch what i'm"
"really curious to see is how the m2"
"macbook pro will compare to the new m2"
"macbook air i do have a feeling that"
"this year we will be seeing a bigger"
"performance difference between"
"the air and the pro in fact when we were"
"testing the m2 macbook pro we actually"
"heard the fan being on almost all the"
"time during the blender test whereas the"
"m1 model or even the 14 inch"
"they were pretty much silent so yeah"
"definitely stay tuned to the channel"
"subscribe to see the macbook air video"
"as soon as we have it and if you are"
"interested in purchasing any of these"
"feel free to use the affiliate links"
"below as they do help out the channel as"
"well i'm daniel this means enough tech"
"and i'll see you guys in the next one"
"cinema tech signing out cheers"
"[Music]"
"all right so the macbook pro 13 m1 has"
"been my daily driver now for the past"
"six months"
"and i thought i'd give you some insight"
"into what my experience has been like"
"so let's go"
"[Music]"
"the purpose of this video is to give you"
"some insight into whether an m1 device"
"is worth buying or not"
"i'll cover how the chip has held up over"
"the past 6 months and if there have been"
"any issues that have shown up over time"
"also revisit some of the support issues"
"that i had back in december with the m1"
"chip and how the native apple silicon"
"support scene is looking today and also"
"give you my recommendation for whether"
"to buy this or not"
"one of the main things that i was"
"excited about before i got my hands on"
"the laptop was the idea that the company"
"that's creating these super powerful yet"
"cool to the touch tablets known as ipads"
"is now going to develop their own"
"processors for"
"laptops which gave the promise of an"
"ultra powerful laptop that never gets"
"hot"
"essentially the couch developer's dream"
"and when i first got the laptop this was"
"the first thing that i wanted to test"
"and in my early testing it definitely"
"held up to the promise"
"it never got hotter than what i would"
"call slightly below lukewarm and this"
"was also after"
"heavy use but the question is how is"
"this held up six months later"
"with updates and software installs and"
"basically never turning the laptop"
"off ever well it still never really gets"
"hot and"
"i would say that it gets like lukewarm"
"but never really hot"
"and to me this is just such a huge thing"
"because"
"generally i will actually use a laptop"
"in the way that it's intended judging by"
"the name at least"
"which is on top of my lap and the m1 is"
"by far the most comfortable laptop to do"
"this with"
"compared to any other laptop that i've"
"tried none of them even come close"
"yes it gets a little bit warmer after"
"several hours of use but compared to"
"literally all other laptops it's cold"
"and the fan noise is still non-existent"
"i've heard the fans"
"twice in six months now if you're in"
"like a completely silent room and you"
"put your ear like right next to the"
"laptop then yes you could probably hear"
"something at some points"
"but what i'm saying is like if you go"
"about your working day as you normally"
"would"
"then no you will never really detect the"
"fan noise"
"when i say that i've heard them like"
"twice in six months"
"what i mean here is that i've like been"
"able to detect"
"any sort of noise or noticed that the"
"fan started increasing in speed"
"so this is not to the point where like"
"all i could think about was the fan"
"noise it's just to the point where i was"
"able to detect that there"
"was some sort of noise which you know by"
"itself is really impressive i think"
"but couple this with the performance"
"that this machine is actually capable of"
"and it actually becomes like it really"
"becomes unfathomable what this is"
"all right so i tried to build or like"
"hold some sort of tension about like"
"whether i would recommend this or what i"
"think of it has it held up has it not"
"held out but"
"by now you probably know that i would"
"definitely recommend this laptop but"
"either way let's take a look at some of"
"the negatives of this laptop"
"so if we look back at when i first got"
"the laptop there were definitely some"
"things that were not"
"ideal about it mainly third-party"
"software not supporting apple silicon"
"so let's take a look at what i said"
"about that okay so in the video i"
"mentioned that homebrew wasn't supported"
"yet and that meant that"
"installing certain things wasn't as easy"
"as just typing brew install"
"but i didn't really have to wait too"
"long because this was fully supported by"
"february of that year so i got the"
"laptop in mid december"
"and it was supported in february which"
"means that right now"
"homebrew is definitely supported fully"
"supported on the apple silicon the next"
"thing that i said in the video was that"
"flutter worked which"
"was not quite the case it worked but"
"only via the rosetta translator"
"process thingy which means that i was"
"able to work with it but not"
"natively so how does this look today six"
"months later today flutter is"
"almost a hundred percent natively"
"supported some things still use rosetta"
"to compile"
"so it's not fully optimized yet but i"
"should also mention that flutter even"
"via rosetta has worked really well ever"
"since the start and i haven't really"
"noticed any like performance issues or"
"anything like that"
"nor have i actually noticed any real"
"performance gains over time as like"
"flutter started natively supporting"
"apple silicon more and more"
"which i think is really a testament to"
"how good apple silicon actually is"
"that it's able to like deliver this top"
"of the line performance even via a"
"translation process"
"like rosetta after this i mentioned that"
"certain python libraries weren't fully"
"supported on apple silicon yet"
"and this was actually quite a big"
"problem for me because it meant that for"
"like"
"several months i didn't even bother"
"trying to program in python on my apple"
"m1 and this is because like any time i"
"tried to it was just such a horrible"
"experience because of"
"the stuff just not being supported and"
"it just meant that i was like"
"running into bug after bug after bug"
"however now most python libraries seem"
"to work for the things that i've tried"
"scikit-learn for instance which i"
"mentioned in the video now has full"
"support and if there are any like niche"
"python libraries out there that don't"
"work"
"yet then they will actually work via"
"rosetta and like i said i haven't really"
"found any performance issues or anything"
"like that using rosetta"
"and to me it's just been super smooth"
"even though i would say like i'm not the"
"most rigorous python programmer out"
"there that uses"
"tons of obscure libraries or anything"
"like that but right now i work in python"
"without any issues and i've been doing"
"so for the past couple months so the"
"apple silicon support system has grown"
"really rapidly in the past six months"
"and i would say that probably in like"
"another six months"
"it will probably be hard to find things"
"that don't actually support apple"
"silicon"
"and also i would say that all the"
"problems that i mentioned are very like"
"developer specific"
"meaning that if you're like a regular"
"user then you wouldn't have even"
"noticed any of these issues if you"
"bought your laptop in the past couple"
"months"
"all right so now let me just take a"
"quick second to talk about brilliant who"
"very kindly agreed to sponsor this video"
"if you haven't heard about brilliant"
"brilliant is a website and app designed"
"for learning about math and science"
"they have tons of really interesting"
"courses on computer science that i think"
"you guys would really enjoy"
"when i was in school me and a lot of my"
"classmates would use brilliant to learn"
"about certain complex topics"
"in computer science like certain"
"algorithms or math concepts"
"that we felt our teachers didn't do a"
"great job of explaining"
"so brilliant really earns its name by"
"actually being a brilliant way to learn"
"if you're interested in computer science"
"math or science in general"
"then i would highly recommend going to"
"holden to sign up for free the first 200"
"people will get"
"20 off their annual premium membership"
"okay so the next thing that i want to"
"mention just quickly is the battery life"
"and this is again of course quite insane"
"which"
"like i mentioned at the start i never"
"turned off my laptop really in the past"
"six months i've turned it off maybe like"
"four times"
"so it's basically always on and the"
"battery life is really really good and i"
"think it's really worth emphasizing"
"because"
"in terms of everyday use i don't even"
"know how long it lasts because i charge"
"it so rarely"
"now that's not to say that it's like it"
"lasts several months or anything like"
"that it's just that"
"it lasts so many days that i forget when"
"i charged it last"
"it's to the point now where it feels"
"kind of foreign to get"
"the low battery notification i feel like"
"this whole video basically comes across"
"as pretty much as biased as it gets"
"and it probably seems like i'm like the"
"biggest apple fanboy out there and"
"i'm really not that at all i like apple"
"but i also really like"
"dell i like lenovo i like racer hp"
"and all those laptops i get really"
"excited about it's just that"
"now none of them really seem to compare"
"in my opinion one might be slightly"
"faster in a specific test"
"and one might have slightly longer"
"battery life or faster wake up time but"
"none of them seem to be able to combine"
"all these features in one machine the"
"way that apple has done here and knowing"
"that the"
"m1x or m2 or whatever apple we'll call"
"it is probably right around the corner"
"it just feels like"
"amd and intel have a lot of catching up"
"to do in order to beat"
"apple also as a side note the wake up"
"time is still crazy fast"
"like i said i never turn it off and it"
"still wakes up before i"
"finished opening the laptop up so would"
"i recommend this laptop"
"big reveal coming"
"no i would never of course i would"
"recommend this laptop"
"of course i would recommend it a"
"thousand percent i would recommend this"
"laptop i would recommend you to get"
"any apple m1 laptop that you can find"
"actually"
"whether it's the macbook air or the"
"macbook pro uh"
"really i just think that it seems like"
"it's the best choice of laptop that you"
"can get right now"
"and the reason for this is i really"
"believe that this laptop will hold up"
"for several years to come"
"famous last words but in all seriousness"
"i really think that apple went out"
"quite hard here to really distinguish"
"themselves as better than intel and amd"
"so they probably poured almost all they"
"were capable of into this chip"
"to make sure that it was a success i"
"mean their entire 2 trillion"
"yes that's 2 trillion dollar business"
"at least somewhat depended on this chip"
"being successful so my guess"
"is that the m1x or the m2 or the mx"
"whatever apple ends up calling it will"
"probably not be"
"that big of an upgrade compared to the"
"m1 and i'm not an expert or anything"
"like this but"
"i'm just thinking that like if the next"
"chip is as big of an upgrade as the m1"
"was"
"then we basically probably need to look"
"into what kind of dark magic"
"apple has developed that basically"
"allows them to put themselves"
"this far ahead of everyone else anyway"
"that's it for this one i hope you"
"enjoyed it"
"and i also want to mention that i'm"
"actually creating courses over on"
"patreon right now and one of my most"
"recent ones is how to build a trading"
"bot"
"which is available in full on my patreon"
"account which means that you can just"
"basically"
"sign up once and then you can"
"unsubscribe straight away and you'll"
"have access to the full course"
"if you want to but also no pressure to"
"do that i really just appreciate that"
"you watched this video"
"and that you watched it this far so yeah"
"thank you for watching and i hope i'll"
"see you in the next one"
