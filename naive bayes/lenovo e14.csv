Bought from seller OEMGenuine. All things are fine regarding Seller and Condition. I would purchase another Laptop from OEMGenuine if I needed to.The Laptop itself is bad. Thinkpad E14 model.There is no CD/DVD Drive, you have to buy an external One if you want to do something as basic as watch DVDs on it now. I guess Computer Manufacturers have decided for Us that "nobody wants that anymore."There is no Number Pad. Some people don't care about Number pads, but this Laptop doesn't even give you the Option to ignore it. There just isn't One! You will have to buy an external Number Pad if you want One.There are bright white LED Indicators for Key Locks, and also for the Power Button, and they cannot be disabled. When the Laptop is in Sleep Mode it will slowly pulse its white Light and illuminate the whole Room at Night. Only the Laptop can sleep through this. The LEDs are eyesores even with normal usage. White is an inappropriate color for an LED Indicator on a Laptop.The keyboard has chiclet style Keys in an "island style", so they're built into a plastic Frame with individual gaps for each Key, and the Keys rise out of the Gaps. Proponents of this Keyboard Style sometimes say that it helps keep Debris from getting under the Keys. But they are wrong. Debris will get into the Keys unless you are Computing in a Sterile Laboratory, and when Debris does get under one of the Keys you can't pry the Key up to remove the Debris even a little bit, and you can't shoot compressed Air underneath the Key to dislodge it. You will just have to mash the key around and try to crunch the Debris into slightly less intrusive Grit. (Bear in mind that we suggest NOT removing the Keys manually for cleaning - Chiclet Key Retainers love to break when lifted from Above.)Very poor design Decisions made for such an expensive Laptop. It used to be that spending more Money would get you more or better Features. Now it just buys sharper Build Quality and prestigious Brand Name.
As a teacher in the realm of distance teaching, I have a lot of programs that I need to use at once concurrently with live streaming, so multi-tasking without lag was a must when I bought a new PC.  I've believed in Intel i7 processors for many years now, and 32GB of RAM was my goal.  Even in a matter of a day, my programs are all zooming along at once, as I reinstalled Windows on an NVMe SSD in the m.2 slot near the standard SATA III SSD, which acts as storage in my setup.  I've never had a more potent or quieter laptop!The 14" display is a perfect size for me, and having the ThinkShutter to block the camera is a big help in terms of privacy.Longevity and durability is always a waiting game, but I believe in how well this PC was crafted.  I recommend this ThinkPad E14 i7/32GB RAM/1 TB SSD setup wholeheartedly.
I was looking for a relatively quiet (low fan noise) laptop that had enough power to run some occasionally heavy load software like simulators or compilers. I also didn't want to pay for a touch screen which I know I'll never use. I detest finger prints on the screen. Although not the fastest machine on the market, this 15W  I5 processor allows the machine to quickly chew through many tough applications and do it quietly. It was delivered ahead of the original estimate and arrived in perfect condition. I'm very happy with the power and size of this machine and would recommend it to anyone looking for a small quiet laptop that looks like it's built to last.
The E14 has lived up to its brand so far. It is excellent all-round, except that it is not touch screen. I an quite satisfied.
light on unnecessary bloatware (maker-installed software)has lots of important port types, such as HDMI, USB (Older) and USB-Cboots to login screen in under 20 secondshas ethernet portblack is sexy
Issues with headphones jack.. doesn't work well with iTunes.. you have to plug headphones in first before turning on iTunes for it to work
Bought to replace a cheapie laptop. I need a good processor for school and work. Set-up was super easy and it was updated. Battery life isn’t anything to write home about, but overall I’m pleased with it.
The Thinkpad E490 by Lenovo is a great computer, very impressed. The keyboard is perfect and a dream to type on. I just got a new larger laptop and my Lenovo, now a backup machine, is still my favorite to type on. If your a writer or do a lot of writing I'd say check out this line of laptops. I would have gotten a new Lenovo 15" but their 15" all have a keypad on the keyboard which makes the unit to wide for lap use.
Excellent laptop. Needed 32Gb for local kubernetes development, so far so good. Linux ready.
I bought the computer in July and in November my HDD died. I consider myself as a normal standard user, I dont change anything in computers settings and mostly use the computer for preparing classes I give.Computer was working pretty nicely until I turned it off and the next morning I got into a boot loop and the system couldnt boot at all. Why? No idea, I didnt do anything special as I did the other days. I took it to the local technical service where I was told that the HDD is somehow damaged and to get at least some of my data it requires a WinLocker password.I immediately contacted OEMGenuine and their technical support. They answered once on my email and didnt provide any asnwer related to the password-protected HDD and since then it's week of silence.I do need help and I kindly ask for it. Please, be a responsible company and let your customers at least know that you are alive and try to solve something.I dont have very expensive computer working, nor my data, nor any response.IT'S FEBRUARY 2021 AND NO ONE ANSWERED! 3 MONTHS! PLEASE BE CAREFUL! SUCH A SHAME!
Crashes Frequently. Main reason for sudden shutdown is Kernel Power Event ID 41. Never experience any laptop like this. Very bad performance
I bought this laptop under the impression it was new, however three months in and randomly the laptop DIES and never shuts back on. I take it to our company's IT and a Lenovo service center and the experts tell me the slated drive has been switched from the original and isn't under warranty. I was completely blown because the product was NOT listed as refurbished and I had work files open during the time it died. I would highly recommend to avoid buying products from this seller.
This a well built computer; easy to use.
Computer served its purpose for 14 months. Operating system failed. Purchased new hard drive. Could not update firmware.Disappointed.
I was surprised at how lightweight this computer is! And a powerhouse, as well. I do graphics work, with multiple movie and sound clips at once, and it handles it really well.
Very  Good
Loving my new laptop. Works fast, screen color is so clear and it’s lightweight. Using it for online classes right now.
Like everything about it, exceeds all my old laptops that I had. Finally able to get work DONE!
Exactly what I had ordered! Been waiting a while to save up for it and I’m glad I made the purchase.
I've only had this laptop for a few days but it has been great. Runs fast and does everything I need it to do. We'll see how longevity is and I'll update later if there are issues, but for now I can recommend it as a good purchase.
Terrible product. Slow, outdated, overpriced, graphics lacking, cannot support even basic functionality.
Something is wrong with this laptop. After 5 months replaced motherboard and then 2 weeks later needed to replace again.
The laptop ran unbelievably slow, even after updating Windows and all drivers. It took upwards of 10 minutes to start up and took about 5 minutes to open any program, even just a simple browser.When I called technical support, they asked me to update Windows and the drivers (I already had done that). After that, they said I'd have to send the laptop in for repairs (a brand new laptop).When I tried to get a refund, they said it was past the 30 day policy (the laptop was purchased by my brother in November and given to me as a Christmas present - it was past the 30 days before I even opened it) and that I couldn't get a refund.I would not recommend this laptop, as it did not work as expected even brand new. Moreover, I wouldn't recommend any Lenovo products as their technical support and customer service is very difficult to work with. I did not feel like I was taken care of as a customer.
Product as described and fast delivery
This think is a super quite powerhouse. I recently had my Alienware 17xR3 stolen and needed another laptop, time for a upgrade anyways. This thing is legit one of the best laptops I have ever owned. Wanted something a bit smaller than the 17in that I had and this laptop is great for the price. Super thin and super light.
I have owned this laptop for over a year and use it everyday for work. This is an excellent machine for typical business users. The machine has plenty of CPU power, memory, and disk for my needs. It boots Windows 10 fast and I have had zero hardware problems. I really like the Battery Charge Threshold feature. This sets the maximum charge on the battery to 80% which prolongs battery life (not runtime) if the laptop is mostly used while plugged into AC. The screen is clear and crisp. We have kids in college and this is my 4th Lenovo laptop purchase. I have a gaming rig desktop so I cannot say if it runs games but it does run Roblox just fine.
these come with USA power adaptors!  so not useful in AUS
The Lenovo ThinkPad E14 is an office laptop, which is not as slim as the devices from the X-series and there are not as many features as on the T-series, but the laptops often cost only half the price and they offer all the important things you need to work. Lenovo also fixes one major complaint and equips the new ThinkPad E14 G3 with brighter displays and there is also an optional screen with 100% sRGB coverage.
Lenovo did not change the chassis and the black design might appear a bit boring, but it is definitely functional. You can notice the low price in terms of materials because you get a combination of plastic and aluminum (lid and bottom panel). The stability is still good and you cannot twist or dent the base unit (no creaking sounds). The lid itself is also sturdy, but we can quickly provoke picture distortions with concentrated pressure on the back and twisting attempts. The hinges are well adjusted and there is only minor bouncing.
The E14 G3 is the heaviest and largest device in our comparison group; it is noticeably deeper in terms of footprint. The USB-C power adapter tips the scale at around 360 grams.
The port situation is still the same, even though we would appreciate some updates. You get a USB-C port including charging functionality as well as DisplayPort and a full-size HDMI output, but a slow USB 2.0 port is not really appropriate for a laptop in 2021. More expensive ThinkPad models (like the T-series) definitely have an advantage in this regard.
Lenovo uses a Wi-Fi 6 module from RealTek, but the transfer rates are lower compared to , which was equipped with the Intel AX200. It is now a 1x1 module (160 MHz) with a maximum transfer rate of 866 Mbps. The signal quality was always good during our review period. The E14 G3 also offers a Gigabit Ethernet port, but there are no WWAN modules available.
As expected, you only get a simple 720p webcam (0.9 MP) with a mechanical shutter (ThinkShutter), which takes pretty bad pictures. There is also an IR camera for facial recognition via Windows Hello.
Similar to previous ThinkPad E laptops, you can remove the whole bottom cover, but the process is not simple. The panel is still extremely tight after you have removed all the screws and there are plenty of plastic clips that can break easily. Other ThinkPad models are much easier to open.
The warranty once again shows the entry-level position of the ThinkPad E14, because our test unit only comes with a one-year warranty. You can still extend the duration for an additional price. Some models of the E14 are also sold with a two-year warranty.
The ThinkPad E14 G3 still gets the familiar and excellent keyboard with 1.8 mm travel and rich feedback. Despite the low price, the E14 has a big advantage over much more expensive ThinkPad X models, which are now equipped with shallower and flatter keyboards. You will definitely be happy when you write a lot and the E14 G3 also comes with a two-stage background illumination.
The displays have always been a problem of the inexpensive ThinkPad E14-series. The picture quality was okay for an office laptop, but the brightness was hardly competitive at around 250 nits. Lenovo now improved the situation, and our test unit is the default IPS screen with an advertised brightness of 300 nits, and our test unit even manages 330 nits. There is also an optional panel with full sRGB coverage if you want to edit pictures. Some regions also get an inexpensive TN panel with a brightness of 250 nits, but we would not recommend this option.
We analyzed the display with the professional CalMAN software and the grayscale is already very accurate out of the box. There is only a minor blue cast, but it is not visible with the naked eye. The colors on the other hand clearly show that it is an inexpensive IPS screen with limited color gamut (~60% sRGB) and we can see huge deviations compared to the sRGB reference color space.
We calibrated the panel (X-Rite i1 Pro 2) and the corresponding profile can be downloaded in the box above. The grayscale improved a bit, but the colors still show high deviations.
The additional brightness is definitely appreciated outdoors and you have a little bit more headroom, but you should still get a place in the shade for the most comfortable viewing experience.
Our review unit is equipped with the  with 6 cores (12 threads) and a maximum clock of 4 GHZ. More technical information about the CPU is available .
The new ThinkPad E14 beats the rivals in multi-core benchmarks. Tiger Lake based laptops are much slower and even the 45W processor  in the  is slower than the AMD chip. If you only stress one core, however, the Intel chips have an advantage. We should mention that Intel CPUs often benefit from high power limits for short peak load, which is not the case for the AMD chip in the E14. The performance is not reduced on battery power.
Talking about the overall system performance, the new ThinkPad E14 G3 leaves a great impression. The results in the synthetic benchmarks confirm our subjective impression; the device executes inputs very quickly and there are no bottlenecks in the system configuration. You can expand the memory up to 40 GB (8 GB onboard + 1 RAM slot up to 32 GB).
Our standardized latency test (web browsing, YouTube 4K playback, CPU load) shows increased latencies for the ThinkPad E14 G3, so there can be problems when you use real-time audio applications.
The ThinkPad E14 G3 has two SSD slots. Our review unit was equipped with a compact M.2-2242 module from SK Hynix (BC711) and a storage capacity of 512 GB (435 GB free after initial set-up). Both drives are attached via PCIe-3.0 x4 and the transfer rates are good. Thanks to the empty M.2-2280 slot, it is very easy to upgrade the storage capacity if necessary. More SSD benchmarks can be found .
The Ryzen 5 5500U is equipped with the integrated Radeon RX Vega 7, which is basically the old  we already know from Ryzen 4000 chips. More technical information about the iGPU is available . This is also the case for the performance, which benefits from the dual-channel memory configuration, but it is on the expected level in general. Intel's integrated , which is also available in the Intel model of the , for example, is a bit faster in the synthetic benchmarks.
The difference between the Vega 7 and the Iris Xe Graphics G7 (96 EUs) is much smaller in the actual gaming benchmarks. Gaming is possible on the E14 G3, but you are usually limited to low or medium settings to get smooth gameplay. More gaming benchmarks with the Vega 7 are available .
The new E14 G3 still uses a single fan and it is a very quiet device overall. Compared to many Intel based laptops, there is no high power limit, so the fan usually does not start spinning in short peak load scenarios. The noise level is still convenient when you stress the CPU and the iGPU simultaneously and there are no annoying frequencies. We did not notice any other electronic sounds like coil whine on our test unit, either.
The ThinkPad E14 G3 is not uncomfortable warm, despite the quiet fan. We can determine almost 50 °C at the bottom during the stress test and you should not put the device on your lap in this scenario, but there are no limitations in everyday situations. The fan speed is a bit lower when you play games like Witcher 3, so the chassis is even a bit warmer.
We can once again see that the consumption levels off at 30 Watts during the stress test. There are some fluctuations after about 10 minutes but the performance is very stable in general and there is no major drop. The processor runs at 6x 2.6-2.8 GHz and the iGPU at ~450 MHz. There is no performance reduction immediately after the stress test.
The two stereo speakers once again carry the same Harman branding and we cannot notice a difference from the previous model. The result is surprisingly good for an inexpensive office device and you can easily enjoy some videos or some background music. Conferences benefit from the good representation of high tones, which is great for clear voices.
Our consumption measurements show slight improvements, because the idle values are comparable or even slightly better compared to the ThinkPad E14 G2 (both Intel as well as AMD), despite the brighter display. AMD system behave differently under load since there are no increased power limits for short periods, so the consumption is stable. We determine up to 55W during the stress test, so the compact 65W power adapter (USB-C) is completely sufficient.
Lenovo increased the battery capacity to 57 Wh and this obviously has a positive effect on the battery runtime. Almost all the rivals including the two models of the ThinkPad E14 G2 (both AMD as well as Intel) are clearly beaten. Our Wi-Fi test at an adjusted brightness of 150 nits results in almost 11.5 hours and still more than 8 hours at the maximum brightness. It seems that AMD laptops with shorter battery runtime are a thing of the past. The video test benefits from the more efficient video decoder with a runtime of almost 14 hours.
The third generation of the ThinkPad E14 is once again a good office laptop with a great price-performance ratio. You do not get the most high-end specs or best materials, but the notebook does not disappoint in the important sections and it is once again equipped with an excellent keyboard, which is not the case anymore for many more expensive ThinkPads. The keyboard is also a big advantage compared to the rivals.
A good solid laptop for work from home or doing school work and it&#39;s under $1000. 🤓
Is it good for autocad?
good video bro... just what i was looking for
That’s my work laptop.


I have E14 Gen 3 and using it for games and media. Awesome!!


Qué modelo es amigo?
Hello, I am the person in charge of a laptop battery factory and would like to cooperate with you to promote our laptop battery bran
Nice video bro keep it up. Hope you are doing well man.

Is keyboard light💡💡💡 support
You made you video universal by mentioning weight in kilograms unlike other Chanel’s 😂, like for that

Does it suffer from coil whine or not? And great video! I love your greeting at the beginning. What does it mean? 😁
He threw the documentation away. I SuBsCrIbeD Immediately !!

That’s the same as my work laptop, but intel core i5 11th Gen processor. I personally own a similar laptop, the Lenovo Ideapad flex 5i, intel core i7 11th Gen processor. I think it would be a great comparison between the E14 Gen 2 and the ideapad flex 5.

Since the vent is located just behind the hinge, I am curious to know the problems in the long run...How are the thermals ?
Should I go for the E14 (11th gen) or X13 (10th gen) ?

Would you tell me price?
Hi, between a thinkpad E, T or L, wich one is the best please?


I watched your review just a day after purchased this laptop. No regret except at the brightness of the screen. I think it is too dim and a bit hard to see
Hi there! Great video. I am probably going to buy this Lenovo E14 Gen2 with i7 11th gen, 16GB Ram and MX450 graphics card but the issue is 14 inches. I haven&#39;t used any 14 inches laptop before so do you think the screen is too small or is it considered to be normal? I am going to study CS this year and I am assuming this laptop with high specs(intel i7 and discrete graphics card) should be okay for me for 4 years. I would be happy if I can get an answer. Thanks!

Bad unboxing

does it have backlight

Got this laptop for &quot;free&quot; from my college
Is it any good for 3D modeling with all the upgrades?

Why do you remind me of a Chinese version of Ross Geller ?

Hello Sir,<br>Can you tell me main difference TN vs IPS?<br>I am also planning to buy it.<br>But there is only one option TN panel.<br>I am little be afraid TN panel quality.<br>Is TN panel really bad?

I&#39;m confused, some model have backlit keyboard, some only have built-in fingerprint security
Liked. Subbed. Shared
Thank you for the review. Bought this laptop with additional RAM stick.















Please E15-Gen2 review
Hello.<br>I bought this laptop. I notice that on my laptop, the screen has no magnet.<br>So when I close the computer, and put it vertically (in a bag for example), the screen tends to open slightly. You too? Or have you noticed that your screen has a magnet that allows you to firmly hold the screen closed?<br>Thank you for your answer.
Is this model compatible with Lenovo&#39;s own Thinkpad USC-C dock? I&#39;m unfamiliar with how Usb-c expansion works when it comes to AMD processors
Grabbed the intel version because of thunderbolt 4, thank you!


The Thinkpad E14 Gen 2 I bought, did not have a fingerprint reader and back-lights, in the U.S. at least. Great review though.

You just made my day u explained everything i was searching for in your detailed review now i know I&#39;ll buy this laptop until stock are back again here in India <br>Oh man I&#39;m glad i found ur channel although through other channel



stop cosplay dave 2d))))))


Great review! Do you think that this one is better choice than yoga slim 7 with the same specs? Thanks
Does the I light up on all the Thinkpads ?
Hi! does anyone knows if the display can be change?
Just bought one a few months back, I have zero regrets
















After I used disk partition, the typical wallpaper of this laptop gone.😢
Bios no legacy boot ! Problem ?
Buddy what&#39;s the difference between e14 and e14 gen 2 ?

I&#39;d recommend buying the 8GB model and then installing an additional 8GB Stick into the DIMM slot yourself. An additional 100 dollars for 8 gb of ram is ridiculous


Lạ thay có thể kết nối với với english. Hiểu biết 1 chút sp.
E series is the poor man&#39;s thinkpad

Bought this laptop last month. Within 2 weeks the screen started to bend / warp. Probably because the lid couldn&#39;t handle the screen heat. Now back to Lenovo for repair.




The laptop I got has backlight bleeding in the corners should I get it replaced?
This video helped me in my purchase of this laptop, thanks man!













Thanks for the video uncle !👍🏻

Hey dear ur explation is awesome❤️love from india

Hi Mr. BsianDad!<br>Question: In this one can we put a normal USB-C docking with power and hdmi ports and plug a monitor in it? <br>My previous laptop was an IdeaPad s340 and doesn&#39;t support video over the USB-C port. Something related to &quot;DisplayLink&quot; or something like that. <br>Thanks! have a nice holidays!

Please mention the model number of the review laptop?
does it comes with backlit keyboard?

Does it come in 15inch?
What kind of ssd upgrade does it support M2 Nvme or M2 sata or both

Man, he went to town rubbing on that computer.

From the lenovo website. Does the charger came by default or you have to choose to add charger in the accessories?


Hello!<br><br>My school is offering Lenovo E14 ThinkPads with a Ryzen 7 4700U Processor, 14&quot; FHD, 16 GB DDR, and 512 SSD for $871.<br><br>Is this a good deal?





Hey mate, thanks for the review! Keep on smiling and happy :) Love from NSW!

What graphic card does it come with? Radeon vega 8?

It&#39;s like Ideapad with different keyboard

Just got one in Australia for 850

Nice video!<br>Btw, how&#39;s the display on this thing? Is it bright enough?

I&#39;ve read reviews claiming this laptop has issues waking from hibernation.


Love the vibe excited for the review

Thank you for the unboxing, great work, as always!<br>The laptop looks nice, we&#39;ll see what this fan is offering during the review! I generally stay away of near-screen vents in case I need to use the laptop closed but connected via a docking station.

hi. doin great work :) keep up the good work
Cheers, the country I live in uses the metric system so it something that even helps me out and my original intended audience 😃


Thanks, if we need help we search online anyway =), but I think they include it as legal requirements...

Definitely! 👍


All comes down to budget. The X13 is lighter and thinner but in terms of performance the E14 11th gen is way more powerful especially the graphics department.


ThinkPad T is the most premium but the E series isn&#39;t far behind the T series.
@BsianTech thank you a lot for your response !!


I think the 14inch is a good sweet spot of screen size and weight. Even though 15 inch displays are nice but the weight of 15 inch laptops you do feel as for 17 inch well that&#39;s completely another story. As for the configuration looks good to me for Computer science.

Is it so?

It can be configured with backlight or it can be configured not to have it. You have to double check the place you purchasing it from, if you purchasing at the Lenovo website this is one of the option under the keyboard section.


It can do it but not ideal, I would be looking for something that has a discrete graphics for much better performance for 3D modeling.

Wow thank you, a few past comments has said the similar, this will make my wife happy as one of her all time favorite shows is Friends =).

It is very bad... You need an IPS panel to be satisfied.



So, how is your overall experience? I&#39;m looking forward to buy it.
@Kermit DA Phrogge Goos choice to work, i also extend ram up to 40Gb (with one 32Gb 3200Mhz stick)
@Ihor Surkov have you got any display issues?
@Kermit DA Phrogge nope, looks like i got model with good ips display.
@Ihor Surkov thanks, Bro.
@Kermit DA Phrogge and just small question, are you going to use linux? If yes, you need to suspend laptop before Fn keys start working in OS, with MS Windows all ok, all functions working good.
@Ihor Surkov I&#39;ll use linux in it. I was thinking of buying a NVMe 512GB and install Ubuntu there. <br><br>Brother, you&#39;re saying that I have to keep lapto on and leave it like that for sometime after installing linux for the function key to get working? Is that right?<br><br>Did you install linux? Did the touchpad work?
@Kermit DA Phrogge touchpad working - for using Fn keys you need suspend laptop - only after this action Fn keys working perfectly. FYI I bought laptop with one nvme driver on 512Gb - so just i upgrade it is RAM stick. From scratch in my model i got additional port for secondary nvme ssd - and not bad ssd from a scratch
@Kermit DA Phrogge You just texting me in privat message and I provide all needed information that was helpful for me
@Ihor Surkov ok. Instagram?
@Kermit DA Phrogge yeap, try @ihorsurkov
@Ihor Surkov hey, how its battery life.  i am a CS student so is it recomendable
@Samay Navale Up to 5 hours - it depends on the brightness level and CPU load. With 33% brightness level and with opened VSCode, gnome-terminal, Slack and Chrome with ~10 pages I got ~ 5 Hours - but it with low cpu level. If you want I can test battery in real-life tasks this weekend and provide you my results.
@Ihor Surkov Ya that&#39;s would be great😍 and is display decent
@Samay Navale Ok.




Hey man! Did you get this version of the laptop? It has 1165g7 Cpu. I&#39;m a little bit concerned because in that review it&#39;s mentioned that the laptop has coil whine issues. I just bought the version with a nvidia gpu.<br>Could you tell me if you have experienced something like that?<br>Thx<br><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-E14-Gen-2-Laptop-Review-Intel-s-Tiger-Lake-quad-core-beats-AMD-s-hexa-core.515944.0.html">https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-E14-Gen-2-Laptop-Review-Intel-s-Tiger-Lake-quad-core-beats-AMD-s-hexa-core.515944.0.html</a>
@Blue69Tube mine had coil whine as well, wasnt annoying tho. i5 version

Hi Michel great to hear you received delivery of this laptop and I hope its been going well for you. The Thinkpad range is very configurable and so different shops or countries will change the configurations of the fingerprint, back-lights, webcam, smart card reader, display type, etc. but these can be configurated into it as custom order, many businesses do this. The unit version I reviewed was from the Black Friday sales via the Australia Lenovo site. Thanks for the feedback as well.

I am glad my review was able to assist answering some questions about this laptop and good to see you manage to make an informed decision akash rathi =). One day YouTube will smile on my channel and give me some good ratings and hit it big.
@BsianTech ofcourse bro in no time i hope
Akash How can I buy E14 in Pakistan

I can only pose, I don&#39;t have the charisma nor the smarts as Dave2D does =) he is absolutely great!
@BsianTech &quot;yes, You can! Just DOOOO IT!!!&quot;)))




Still no regrets? Looking to get one
@H3ft still no regrets, go for it
Hey. Does it open slightly when you keep it in a bag? As someone here said
Is Tn dispaly not a considerable factor??
@B live for me no, it looks good enough. For some people tho it could be a factor.
Is it made of plastic or metal?
@B live both
@Pinakin Kale does  this have speakers tuned by harman.
@Pinakin Kale does it have 1920×1080 p resolution.?
@B live yeah
@B live yeah, just go to Lenovo’s website
@Pinakin Kale thanks man 💥
@Pinakin Kale Is yours a notebook?
Ordered one mate! My first ever laptop going to be this one!
@Imtiyaz sakil   is your laptop still rocking... I will buy one recently.
@Pinakin Kale  is your laptop still rocking... I will buy one recently.



Intel wise Gen 1 is intel 10th gen, Gen 2 is intel 11th gen, and now comming soon in late 2022~early 2023 Gen 3 intel 12th gen. Gen 3 AMD version already released in late 2021 it looks exactly the same as Gen 2 on the outside, but the processor is different.

Me too, I&#39;ll also increase the storage to 512GB
or alternatively, install 16 extra gigs for 24 and it will still be cheaper than the 16 gb model


E is the entry model but from the feel of it and the build plus materials its right up with the rest of the thinkpad range and I have played with their T, X and P series. The new E series is not very far behind.

How has your repair experience with lenovo been?
​@Dr Zaius Many back and forths over whether this was customer damage or not. In the end they agreed to repair under warranty (no charge). Laptop was away for almost a month.
@Jan Smit Yikes. That&#39;s exactly what I have heard about Lenovo&#39;s customer service. Sorry you had to go through that experience. After this experience, do you think you would buy another Lenovo?
@Dr Zaius They are great laptops. All is fine now again. Probably would go for the more robust X1 next time


Glad this was able to help you out Raouf. In my review video I provided the link to unlock the AMD graphics for the screen brightness.
Hey looking to buy this one. How&#39;s it working for you?
@Akshit Asrani its a great purchase man. It&#39;s been 4 months and i still get excited every time i turn it on. Go for it
Is TN panel a downer?
@Akshit Asrani Nope not at all, never had a problem with it. But make sure you get the model with a touch id on the power button. I bought mine from Lenovo China and found out that model doesnt have touch ID. Despite being E14 Gen 2
@Raouf Razak Thanks a lot
@Zwei whats about screen resolution its 1920×1080p?
Speaker are tuned by harman?
@B live yeap, screen is 1080p, and the speakers sound amazing. Loud and clear
@Zwei in terms of battery should we go for 45wh or 56wh
@Sara The processor is really great at power management. I can use it for work the whole day without charging. So don&#39;t worry too much about the batter capacity
@Zwei hey man, I’m a finance major in college. Would this be a good devise for me?
@Leo Ephrem Yes, can never go wrong with a Thinkpad!

Welcome Deepanshu Gutpta, hopefully useful to you.

Thanks very much Ali Haider, glad I was able to make it easy to understand and be valuable in your search. Keep safe =)

You mean thunderbolt 3 or 4....


No, in india


I think M2 Nvme

Main thing is, he knows where the TrackPoint is

The charger comes with the laptop, if you see the charger added in as extra that should be a second charger if you wish to have two.
@BsianTech Thank you for the reply.

yes it is an amazing deal. The 4700u is really fast and 16gb ram is more than enough. Can you please send me the link, I am not able to find it anywhere

@EZart2015 oh so isn&#39;t there like a bestbuy link for something? anyways thanks for the reply
That is a good deal and the computer is really really good performer being the Ryzen 4700U, getting 16GB RAM makes it great for the future. That is fantastic bang for the buck =).

Cheers VaveBytes, this was just unboxing. I now uploaded the review video of this laptop. Sorry I am so far behind in processing all these review videos. You can find the review video here for this laptop <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMXADnpyIHA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMXADnpyIHA</a>

If I recall correctly the Ryzen 5 4500U comes with Radeon Vega 6.

Yes a little but the thinkpad range go though a bit more tests to get the higher ticks for durability.

Fantastic to see you got also a great deal on it! Hello from Brisbane.

He said its bright enough for indoors but a bit to dark if you want to use it outdoors. I think its about 250 nits when that is the IPS model

While doing some long benchmarks I have notice the same thing, I am having same issue waking it up from hibernation too and have turn that feature off. Will be reporting this to Lenovo so I expect a BIOS update or something to patch this issue up soon.
Perhaps disable the fast start-up mode in Windows? 🙂

Thanks very much Jeswin George, I will try get the review out asap.

Pleasure, thought it be useful to others as this is pretty very well priced and quite a surprising good quality laptop for entry model, I think it&#39;s like the mobile market where the entry models have really lifted up it&#39;s game. I am with you there about vents behind the screen hinge as I use my laptop 95% in clamshell mode docked but that is my workflow.

Thanks very much BLuEToXiC, quite a year its been.
"Thanks for your patience all, I got in contact with Lenovo regarding about the display dimming and here is the official word, thank you to Lenovo ANZ team for the clarification. <br>Lenovo response - <br>With respect to display brightness,  it’s hardcoded in the Thinkpad E14 G2 AMD BIOS to balance battery life and performance. One component that drives battery consumption is the LCD brightness. Therefore when running in Battery mode, the display will dim to some extent to get back to a “balance battery life/performance” status.
<br>
<br><br>However there’s a brightness adjustment in AMD Radeon settings that will enable you to manually overwrite the selection.<br><br><a href=""https://support.lenovo.com/au/en/solutions/ht510641-brightness-adjustment-in-amd-radeon-settings-thinkpad-e495-e595-e14-gen2-type-20t7-20t6-e15-gen2-type-20t920t8"">https://support.lenovo.com/au/en/solutions/ht510641-brightness-adjustment-in-amd-radeon-settings-thinkpad-e495-e595-e14-gen2-type-20t7-20t6-e15-gen2-type-20t920t8</a>"




thanks
Is it good for autocad?

Finally. USEFUL reviews. Clear and actionable.
z chip which spies on you and insecure windows 11....not updateable or fixable......the chineese can keep its industrial waste. not in the EU thankyou. Its junk..
You are so good
Great review indeed  very detail and  clear explanation plus there is weighting display from the review and now thats hard to get from  other reviewers  .... <br>As for me weight matters  ... rather than performance mumbo jumbos ...  since I am the one carrying it here and there all day long  ...
Great Review as always. I have this laptop with AMD Ryzen 5 + 16GB Ram + 2 SSD and has been great. <br>Just a suggestion for description, it&#39;s Colombia not Columbia.

Can I use it for video editing, photoshop etc?



Soldered ram is a bit of a deal breaker, 16GB is barely enough to do anything at all, 32GB of RAM is a decent amount for programming, sure you can get 32gb single stick but then you lose on the performance

Самый топовый обзор!) <br>У меня E14 на Ryzen 7 4700, я добавил еще 8gb оперативной памяти, мне 16 пока хватает. Ровно год прошел после покупки, я очень доволен этим ноутбуком, он меня никогда еще не подводил. Я осуществил свою мечту взяв ThinkPad. Если Вы приобретете ThinkPad не пожалеете никогда.
Today i buy e15 with 5500u and i see some reviews of e14 and e15 to see the durability... And you are the only one who try &quot;twist&quot; the laptop. Thanks! (Relax... I did not buy it to twist 🤣 but it is a good test to see the resistance of the chassis hahaha)

I don&#39;t know what else is missing in this review. Finished my chips before the review end. I am comparing this over lenovo ideapad 5.
This is the best video on this product I saw, I needed a work computer this suits me well, and ik going to buy it after your review all the points were explained properly!
If I do only browsing how much % load


Good Review. These E and L series ThinkPads have extremely pathetic battery and its batteries are prone to losing its capacity over time. Check thoroughly before buying. In this price range the LG Gram has phenomenal battery. ThinkPad&#39;s main advantage is their keyboards but battery and screen are a big drawback. LG Gram lacks this kind of keyboard but has the best battery and best screen in this price segment.
Do you recommend it for a programmer?<br>I am thinking of getting it

Has nvidia in the laptop?
Hi there, any idea on the differences between gen 2 and gen 3?<br>Thanks,
Is ist possible to use display out on the usb c port?

i have a question is it touch screen ?
I have to buy a laptop and with my budget I can afford the  E14 or the L14, both AMD. Nearly the same specs except battery and screen better in the e14. <br>I&#39;m leaning towards the L14 because the completely upgradeable ram and the two USB C ports. What model would you recommend between these two?<br><br>Great review and great work with the channel. Greetings from Spain.
Now, that&#39;s what I call a comprehensive review! Keep up the good work, mate!

The brightness change is due to the graphic settings, if you right click on the desktop and go to graphic settings then power you can adjust the display behaviour whether on battery power or plugged in
Great review! 👍

Blackpink

Please is it good for gaming? Kindly reply after reading this 🙏🙏

Awesome review. You deserve way more subs.
Is the keyboard user-serviceable? can it be removed from the front like other thinkpads?
Not bad review but you forgot the most important thing in it how hot did the CPU get at 100% load?
does it have a touchscreen feature?

was considering this laptop.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMXADnpyIHA&amp;t=14m49s">14:49</a> -&gt; that display is a deal breaker.
Is it just me or did everyone face a problem with the boot? I bought this laptop and the moment I turned it on, I ran into the a boot loop. At first I thought that it was because the OS wasn&#39;t installed so I got my USB with windows 10 but that didn&#39;t fix it. I just ended up returning it.
If you consider this affordable, I&#39;m really afraid of &quot;not affordable&quot; notebooks. This notebook is like 100k+ in Russia. This is a lot. I bought Thinkpad L380 for 70k, which was not that really affordable for me then



nice

The brightness is a BIOS setting.
Awesome, bought this with the intel 11th gen refresh (with the XE igpu). I&#39;m a graduate student and it fits my needs.
thanks
Can the soldered 8 GB RAM model be upgraded to 32 GB RAM later? Or does the soldered slot have to be maxed out with 16 GB RAM first? Please reply, thank you.

Bro this is such a fantastic review. You covered every single thing potential customers need to know.
great review!
can it be charged via mobile phone charger or power bank?


Does the hibernation problem solved?

please also make a review of the ThinkPad E14 Gen 3
Does it has automatic booting feature when the lid opened?
Can we replace the Wifi Card with Intel Wifi6 or 6E card? Don&#39;t know why they still keep put a Wifi 5 card in 2021.
Amazing review! full of details. Greetings from Chile, you got another subscriber :)
Can you stress the CPU ( how much Max TDP it uses) as more tdp than the processor limits may results in throttling.. you can use CPUZ to stress test. ( there is an issue in various lenovo laptops relating TDP /source : lenovo forum)
it&#39;s really in depth review. i appreciate your efforts. thanks for making such a wonderful video.
Which Brand RAM is Soldered? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMXADnpyIHA&amp;t=14m00s">14:00</a>

Recently I brought a ThinkPad E14 Ryzen 5 4650u in India but it don&#39;t include backlit keyboard that is so disappointing thing.



Excellent Review .
People need to learn how to do reviews from this dude. He covered everything that can be possibly covered in 18 minutes. Clear and crisp.
I didn&#39;t realise the battery was that bad!<br>Also the speaker is all the ThinkPad I got a X1 carbon the speaker are horribly low on volume can&#39;t hear anything!

Hiee…. Could u please review the same with lenovo thinkpad amd ryzen 5 pro 4650 u with tn panel…<br>Is tn panel really bad as compare to ips panel of the same … thx in advance
The &quot;integrated graphics being pretty decent&quot; does that mean I can run Lightworks and Blender for video editing just fine?
Is it good enough for online classes on google meet for kids?

Very good reviews 👍
This is the most wholesome review I&#39;ve seen so far. Great quality 👍. Also just wanted to know if the onboard SSD is M.2 SATA or M.2 NVMe SSD. It will be mentioned on the sticker of the SSD. Would appreciate if you reply to my query.
Just got it an installed Linux. So far pretty damn good and am quite satisfied with it. Using it along side my Macbook for programming.


What a brilliant review! Just the kind of info one needs to make a purchase decision. Thanks for the hard work.
How many SSD slots are available?

Hi, Bsian Dad. I read that Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 2 has 1.8 mm key travel. Does ThinkPad E15 Gen 2 has 1.8 mm key travel too? <br>Does ThinkPad E15 Gen 2 has the same keyboard typing feeling as the ThinkPad T15?

Sir, big thumbs up for the review. Subbed<br>My question is, what is the upgradability of the SSD? If it is the 512 gig version can I upgrade it more?


Sir, is the AMD 15W or 25W

Can I play GTA V without adding any external graphics card plz reply I am planning to buy🙏🙏
Thank you.
Excellent review....I got this 1
Just a headsup:  mine was aluminium lid and chassis.
Most comprehensive review of this laptop I could find. Thanks
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMXADnpyIHA&amp;t=5m39s">5:39</a> &quot;it&#39;s actually quite stiff&quot;<br><b>*whole thing flexes*</b>

Congratulations for the great content. It is really hard to find this level of review nowadays on YT. Thanks for the details. Please, keep posting!

Finally found the review that I was searching for!!!! <br><br>People talks about battery but anybody did it well!! Thank you very much!

Can connect with 3 monitors?

I have an Intel core i3 model of the same laptop. But it doesn&#39;t have backlit keyboard.

Hi i&#39;m looking for a laptop for 4k video editing with premiere pro /after effects and basically nothing else it will be dedicated to just that. I don&#39;t have loads of cash so i&#39;m looking for under €1.5k, do you have any recommendations? I find all the branding on hardware so confusing to actually know what is what.
Sir, could you do the review on Lenovo Think Pad E15 Gen 2 AMD Ryzen  5-4500U because I heard that it has 56% sRGB and and the cooling system is not good. Thank you!
It was bending mate. The review was cool, not boring at all, u fucking deserve a subscribe and a like!
Between the Thinkbook 14 G2 and Thinkpad E14 which do u recommend?

Keep the good work Sir. This is a good review!
I wonder if you can share with me some information regarding the model/spec of SSD storage since the model I found only has 256 GB and 8 GB DDR4.  DDR4 3200 MHz I can find them on amazon.  But I get confused on the SSD storage. Does  WDS500G3X0C or WDS500G3XHC work?






Any advice on low colour contrast? colours do not seem to pop at all... Ryzen 7 model
What&#39;s the temp on the CPU in performance mode under full load?  I&#39;m getting near 100C
Hi. Between this and thinkbook 13s gen2, which to buy?
Liked. Subscribed. Great details. Thanks
thank you
Detailed as lit 🔥🔥🔥
Helpfull ⚡⚡💯
Hi! i have a thinkpad E14 amd gen 2 with a TN panel, is it possible to change it for an ips one?

nice review

Thank you for this amazing review! Now I know what to save money for!
Thanks, awesome video.
You are really hardworking keep it up you will reach  great heights one day.
How would you compare the build quality of the T14 AMD Gen 1 vs E14 AMD Gen 2. I know you liked the build quality of the E14. Or put another way would the T14 last longer in years compared to the E14 with both being treated the same? Great review and thank you.
How does this specific configuration perform with 1080p video editing? Would you recommend it at this price range

Probably the most wholesome review video out there. Not extra fluff, just how I like it



























A viewer from India here. Are you sure another SSD can be added?? In some reviews on amazon I read it did not work for them.



You know what? The way you are reviewing the laptop is awesome. Your explanation is just superb.
Thats a very detailed review . I liked it. 👏🏼
My laptop display is backlight bleedingin the corners should get it replaced?? Pls reply


is there too much difference between the t14 and this one? i mean is the build quality so different that is worth the extra 250 dollars? at least thats the difference in my country
Thanks for help me to select
We don&#39;t get any backlit keyboard in Indian version 😭😭.... And that is the only thing which strikes ur heart.....
Bro can I play games like GTA 5 or Call of duty warzone on this laptop ?
Bought this laptop last month. Within 2 weeks the screen started to bend / warp. Probably because the lid couldn&#39;t handle the screen heat. Now back to Lenovo for repair.
I just ordered this laptop, thanks for the informative review.   I also like your enthusiasm, keep up the great work!


If only it was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMXADnpyIHA&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> screen
This man requires more likes and more subscribers. Very good review.
Does it support WD GREEN m.2??
Great review with everything I need to know! I think I&#39;m going to go with one of these. I&#39;m not a business user, but a home user that likes to tinker with things like some music production and digital drawing, and some legacy gaming where I don&#39;t need a majorly powerful GPU, although it looks like the integrated Radeon in the Ryzen 4000 series is nothing to sneeze at either. My reason for honing in on a Thinkpad though, is that I value the durability and upgradeability, as I usually keep my laptops for 5 years or more, plus with this E series model it doesn&#39;t really cost much more than a lot of consumer laptops with Ryzen and similar specs. I can take the &quot;cost cutting&quot; measures of the E series as I really don&#39;t need that many ports (nice that this still has full sized HDMI and a flip-down Ethernet jack that doesn&#39;t need a dongle though), and it also loses the 2 signature silver hinges from the L series and up, but I think this one actually looks cleaner. Another reason is nostalgia. The first laptop I bought with my own money after doing odd summer jobs as a kid was a somewhat gutted IBM-made Thinkpad from circa 1997 used on eBay, I forget the exact model. I found all the missing components, like a refurbished battery, AC adapter, RAM, a decently large hard drive, a PCMCIA modem card (family was still on dail-up ugh) and the CD ROM drive (it had one of those hot-swappable drive bays, remember those? I later got the floppy disk one too) and installed Windows XP which was current at the time, and had a really decent computer for cheap. Other than a number of modern developments like thin-ness and display bezel size, the basic shape and design of these newer Lenovo Thinkpads really hasn&#39;t changed all that much. I&#39;m excited to mess around with the TouchPoint nib too, as I got really good with it on my childhood Thinkpad because it only had the TouchPoint as an on-board pointing device and no touchpad. That webcam is kinda meh, but looks perfectly serviceable for video calls, and it looks like it has decent low light performance too. It&#39;s no worse I think that the webcams in MacBooks that cost twice as much, I think they still use 720p webcams.

I just ordered it for my programming and coding needs.😍😍


It was an excellent review 👍
your review is informative and your voice is so clear. very good job.
I buy the L, T and E series laptops for my company.<br>The current E series has better build quality than the L series and on par with the T series.<br>The shell top is Aluminium and the bottom proper rubber strips.<br>Hinge is across the entire length.

Nice video.... greetings from India
I believe the HP equivalent is the 435 &quot;13&quot;), 445 (14&quot;), and 455 (15.6&quot;) G7 Probook models. Great to have so many to choose from. AMD has come on strong with the OEMs.
Very detailed video. I appreciate your efforts.<br>Can you please suggest me one between <br>1. Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen2 (Ryzen - 7) same as in this video but with Ryzen 7<br>2. Lenovo IdeaPad slim 5 (Ryzen 7)<br>Link - <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-14ARE05/p/88IPS501392">https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/laptops/ideapad/s-series/IdeaPad-5-14ARE05/p/88IPS501392</a><br><br>Important-<br>Ram and SSD must be upgradable
The brightness issue can be resolved by going into the AMD Radeon software and disabling Vari-bright option.


really enjoyed your review :)
Sir, does that extra M2 slot, support SDD only? Or can i also put Kingston A2000 M2 NVME SSD.<br><br>I am confuse between M2 SATA SSD and M2 NVME SSD.


How much ssd is here??? And how much can i expand?? Plz tell me sir.
It can go up to total maximum 40G of RAM, I can confirm this because I have the exact Ryzen 5 model and I&#39;ve upgraded mine with an extra 32G 3200Mhz ram.




Ohh my hypothetical god! I have ordered a Thinkpad E14 Ryzen 4500u laptop and have been watching all the reviews for past 2 days.. but none has been as detailed as you are. Keep up the good work and try to promote your videos a little.




I liked this laptop very much and it is available at Rs. 45,999 on Amazon in India. But horrified to buy due to that brightness issue. How will it be fixed?



Really detailed review. Need an update on that screen brightness issue while on battery...is it something a BIOS update can (and will?) fix?
























After upgrade to 16gb ram, will it be good for 1080p video editing in premier pro ? Or should i buy 4700u(not available in here in India)


Does it have a secondary (empty) slot for the ram upgrade or just a single memory slot?

Any plans to do a review on the intel version? got an option to buy one with mx450...


When it goes in hibernation mode you coulndt wake up with pressing some key on keyboard you must press power button at least it works for me. Great laptop i love evertything but battery is terrible omg and i would love that screen is more bright.

Hey! Thanks so much for the in depth review. I have this laptop on order here in India. I was wondering if you could check that the display brightness issue on battery has got nothing to do with the battery modes. Thanks so much.










Does the Ryzen 3 do the job of running all the basics tasks for a student and is the ryzen 3 future proof for the next years to come?

HOW can you get so excited about  a laptop, a thinkpad no less , that doesnt have even one USB A , or HDMI, or SD cad reader?  what can you use this thing for with just USB C and a head phone jack? if I need dongles to get access to USB A , card reader and HDMI, whats the point of beeing thin and light, if I will carry more stuff with me, this , right here is the ANTI X300, the anti Kodachi.

carbon steel is quite an expensive and overkill material for a laptop































Yes, but are they lighter?


yeah it&#39;s crazy but this is also essentially a SkyMall channel so....



Why would you want to do extreme gaming on an ultra-light ultrabook? Get a gaming laptop.




Around mid to late December.



997 grams.

Yes, more specifically, Evo.











Pfffft. Funny.




































I&#39;d also be curious about the real battery life stats


















Lol. I’m so 3 weeks ago. 🤦‍♂️

trackpoint























intel would be preferred thank you









how so?
Because thinkpads are battle laptops. To work. Engineers computers on the shop floor. Thick design for years and years.
It&#39;s thinkpad lite

















Why would you do that? The track point is way better than trackpad









Merica man!

























how much is the price actually?



That&#39;s what she said







Among male devs we have a name for it but I&#39;ll let your imagination take a guess.




Hey Liam , I am planning to buy is just to do office work, youtube, and gmail and Interenet surfing ?? Will it be right choice to make ?









































































there is-
@Piink pearls that&#39;s micro-SD, not full-size SD


















you can switch them in the bios tho
Aktually it&#39;s much better when you need you get used to but many people map Caps lock to Ctrl anyway.

















Polly not, look from a different angle or film it















Uh its not even a kilogram bruh BECAUSE ITS ITS so light oh my



























Because it&#39;s not for gaming lmao


Nah



No































































waiting for Apple Silicon Macs. Hopefully the Air







You can always go linux on it
And then there are people who would rather use Windows than macOS or Linux. Just because you don&#39;t like Windows, doesn&#39;t mean others hate it as well.
















TrackPoint.


I forgot about the Lg gram. I wish the nano also had one type a port and a full SD card slot. I also wish the NvMe is replaceable.

😂😂








Youre the kind of person that has a problem with a probably cheap laptop from a known brand and throw the entire brand under the bus for a failure that seems to be more happening on cheap ass devices like 200 or 4000 euro laptops as example. Evers brand has those cheap af laptops with hinge issues, throwing lenovo from a skyscraper wont make a difference if you buy cheap.
@O yeah, cause a 900 dollar laptop is cheap <br>And even if it was a cheap one i would at least expect A BIT of quality at the important places














Uhh the ThinkPad X1 Nano starts at 1300 dollars so not 3000
















Why





Me too 😂
900 grams
@Akira 907 grams to be exact.
Just go onto your preferred browser and search up: 1.99 lb to grams
@2jz Of course we could do that but it&#39;s still annoying
chandra, well it’s better than not doing that and waiting 5 months for someone to reply to your YouTube comment
@2jz Of course you do that. It&#39;s just a suggestion for next time.
A kilo to me
903gm
It’s good reporting to include an international audience. It’s not like Lenovo sells only in the US.
900grams   it sucks to hear pounds and ouncess shit..wtf is even pound a European currency or weight measure or ponds face powder wtf
@imrankhan wrong 900is better approximation than 907 gram exact weight is 902.64688grams
@Nelson Ogbuigwe you&#39;re Nigerian bro
@Abiodun I meant I also would like it in gram weight
Not even a kilooooooooooo















what does lew mean?
@정우 it&#39;s the unbox therapy guy&#39;s name. Lew
































of course



































the old one was a Garmin, what&#39;s the brand now?






Wheres your podcast then




That&#39;s the jingle, ThinkPad error code 0002.
&quot;Wow, that was Nintendo-like on the start-up.&quot;


Duuuddee I&#39;m like🔥🔥🔥🔥








And nVidia is leagues ahead of AMD.





Got a Gen 1. These people crying poverty need to stop watching these videos.

HD refer to 720p<br>FullHD refer to 1080p<br>“UHD” is—3840 x 2160<br>“4K” is 4096 x 2160<br>8K UHD (7680 × 4320)











Yeah I looked at that when i got a T480s. Great laptop!



















Yeah, but I will most likely get one when it goes on deal. I am done with android tablets.
@Torrance Amie - Have you ever tried DEX? The windowing and desktop like experience is a joy.
@Yeshe Dorje No I never tried DEX, maybe it&#39;s good. I just was burned in the past with Samsung S1, S2 tablets that would not get the next Android version. So I just run Windows laptops now.
@Torrance Amie - You are probably wise, especially if what you want is a full laptop experience. The Tab S7+ is definitely better than any tablet (WOW what a display; it is intoxicating!) I&#39;ve used or seen before. But no tablet is the same as a laptop; a great motorcycle is not a family car. Different devices for different needs. Having a lightweight (1.3 lbs) computing device that I can jot notes on, write letters, read e-books, consume any media and easily carry w/o ever being a burden is a huge value to me. I have an i9 4K Dell Precision mobile workstation with 2 TB of storage and 32 GB memory for doing real work but carrying an additional 5 lbs plus charger is a huge weight I rarely move around with. The Samsung Tab is like fun to dance anywhere with. Light weight DOES have its advantages!















TrackPoint.







I WILL SEND YOU MACBOOK 12IN IT BETTER THAN THIS
@Dumb Dumb Gum Gum sure when you send it?














u?























kkk
With him looking like he just tested positive for the ronazz
🤣🤣🤣
@Wolf Fortress lmfao

chanandler bing migh have different perspective
@Ankit V I want what he&#39;s on
arent you seriously late to the party ? even back in the early day of laptop, which is much heavier, back in the late 90s over 20 years ago, it is already 14 inch and you can still lift them by two fingers ...
@Prince Cooper <br><br>Yes, but the computer can do more than a phone
And we created an mRNA vaccine in less than a year






























y is this true
I thought you little ryan king, thank god you are not
@-_- who is little ryan ??
@Ador Rahman oh you will go to heaven, juat be happy as you are, coz you dont know him, peace
@Ador Rahman Go look him up. He&#39;s a youtube commenter that comments on almost every video you go and watch, but that depends on the video genre.






It’s called “nano” so maybe has some new material that’s carbon as part of the electrics or body maybe a new nano material but could be way wrong here and it’s just a name due to its small size. But ye I thought they same when he said it



❣️❣️😯
Nah, you will download all the apps into your brain with the latest whatsoever technologies Elon Musk offers you. Meanwhile, Lenovo will probably be making power adapters only, if they ever improve it.



















what does full body mean?
@정우 I mean screen to body ratio. Damn near bezel-less. The new dell xps 9500 is an example





















:D good one
Lol 😂😂😂
anaerobic respiration
Big brained science meme~ XD
I thought it was all duo to mitochondria
When you learn about lactic acid in your 7th grade biology class and make a joke about it to show how smart you are.

That&#39;s what she said
So its like a phone weight?
Me too, Ragon. Me too.
Thin and light but not on ur wallet 😭
That&#39;s what she said! Haha!

You have kidney right?
you need a Ryzen 5000 series
As a coder. I totally concur with you on that sentiment. I have become very interested in the AMD hardware ecosystem because of the rise in Intel prices and the way the hardware hasn&#39;t evolved in the way AMD and Mobile processor hardware has.
Why choose intel when you can ryze with Ryzen
Honestly, i9 is just a waste on laptops. Too much heat from i9 (because of the processing power) and the poor ventilation on thin laptops like this will just give you stuttering performance. Save the i9 for desktops. The most practical CPU for laptop is just an i5 unless it is a gaming laptop where i7 will surely shine.
@monkooo love your word game 😄
ryzen 3 is better then i7<br>i agree you need the i9
@Ganie literally don&#39;t get why they&#39;re putting i7s and i10s on laptops<br>I mean it&#39;s a God damn laptop. It&#39;s meant to be carried to coffee shops on planes et cetera.i5 seems like the best sweet spot for long battery life and good thermals
@TheTower coding
@TheTower I like the ThinkPad for its built quality. And you&#39;re right, dual core is enough for most programming situations but ThinkPad quality though


















































Trehhh go on gj

Nope, it&#39;s Mil-spec tested, which means that it has Military-grade durability.

എന്തു  ചെയ്യാൻ  ബ്രോ

Lol 😂






It&#39;s just an advert. Lew isn&#39;t worth $20 Million for nothing...














Or just install linux on it.
Uhm...Thinkpads are mostly used for Linux compatibility 🧐🧐🧐
















Daily ThinkPad user here, for me it has never worn off yet


Its the same



Thunderbolt 4 too!

@Buah Fikr lol thanks I knew because my dad has the x1 carbon 7th gen







































It&#39;s an error beep. You can use the diagnostic app from Lenovo for iOS or Android against the sound . Even on YT. That&#39;s a demo device that was clearly used by someone else before. The red seal on the plastic bag was broken when he unboxed or.


Acer swift 5 is just 900gms
Huawei Matebook X 2020 - 1kg
@Joshua Cheng To be fair, the iPad isn&#39;t a real computer. 😜
@Jean Prouvaire What&#39;s a computer?
@Joshua Cheng Well ipad is a dumbed down computer. Even a calculator can be called a computer. Right now it sit between a tablet and a chromebook.
@Noman Johan Yes I&#39;m aware. The fact that one can play Fruit Ninja, Doom, Tetris, Mario, and any other GameBoy game on a TI-84 CE &amp; TI-Nspire makes them more powerful than the all the computing power available onboard the Saturn V/Apollo 11.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait for expandable smartphones that transform into an iPad Pro or an ultrawide monitor :)
@Joshua Cheng Can&#39;t argue with that :)
I want bettery king
@Beyond Human G14 and X1 Nano also has surprisingly good battery.






How&#39;d you get it last week when it comes out in November?




I was thinking the same🤣🤣
I was looking for this comment 🤣
i mean it gives it a bit of weight <br>when the laptop weighs only 900g <br>even the foam which is prolly a good 20-30 grams its smthn   <br>then again i have no clue bit its prolly around that
That foam has the opposite effect. By substantially increasing the perceived volume of the thing you’re holding you feel that it’s insanely light











































Get a t440-t460 for around $200
I retrogame on x40. Own 3 with ssd upgrades. Sadly no bios upgrade to swap FN/Ctrl,  but still a lovely laptop with the 4:3 screen.









💯💋💯💋

It&#39;s okay for me
Hahahha
Are you like 12 or something?
Nice one 😂👏





🙈🥰🙈🥰

Do you realize that apple had a 900gram 12” macbook since 215?
@Bill Gates <br><br>Yeah but this is still better. And i dont use the metric sustem



Around half. 2lb ≈ 1 kg
@TheYoutuber then can I just half pounds everytime to convert it in kg? 😑






























Lenovo is good stuff!








That always sucks. But yk you can always change them in the bios.
Not in the BIOS, but there&#39;s a dedicated software for that in windows to interchange the keys.
Used to be an option in the BIOS. Idk what&#39;s with it now. But once you get use to it, it just felt natural for me. I used to run X220 - X240

which model did u experience?






Yeah, a ethernet port would be awesome.









this is cheaper
@reHASHed Gaming it starts at $1399 and a macbook air starts at $999 so watchu talkin bou willis













Yeah, foams weigh like 2 kilos.

Because they will have nothing to sell next year!
Why not wish for more if its an &quot;ultimate laptop&quot;. CPU: 4900HS, SSD 4TB NVME, battery: 80w
U missed the OS
@Shawty If you choose the Ryzen, it&#39;s windows. If you choose the A14x (do stats even exist yet?) is MacOS.
@E39 Purist it doesn&#39;t really matter, it&#39;s his personal preference mac also uses Intel 🙂
Also dual boot Win10 macOS LinuxMint and ChromeOS with Android app support. LOL!
@Shawty Clearly said Ryzen, not Intel though 😶
@E39 Purist maybe apple will adapt AMD next year, who knows
@Shawty Never said they weren&#39;t, but I highly doubt it. Apple keeps its abilities to hide its billions by making their margins full enough to not make it sketchy, and picking up graphics loyalties instead of building their own just doesn&#39;t sit well
@E39 Purist um,, this is really off. Apparently, he&#39;s telling his dream laptop. He can choose whatever the F he likes it to be, there&#39;s nothing to do with the barrier of its chip or something
@E39 Purist ???<br>he said he wishes he could pick and choose for the laptop that he wants to be and then you tell me the limitation????
@E39 Purist I wish I could get billion dollars someday, does it ever come true???
@Shawty Because you 1) Initiated a question 2) Rebuttled my answer and 3) chose to continue. All of those are clearly there. I have no idea what you&#39;re attempting to protect but there&#39;s nothing you can say. Save yourself the trouble
"@E39 Purist these lists&quot;Screen - Matebook X Pro
<br>Bezels/IR/Camera - XPS
<br>Trackpad - Apple
<br>Keyboard - X1 Carbon
<br>Speakers - Apple
<br>Speaker Layout - X1 Carbon

<br>SSD - 512 or 1024 Gb
<br>Wifi - 6
<br>Bluetooth - 5.1
<br>Battery - ~50 W &quot; clearly are not there, its just the wishes"
@Shawty I&#39;m talking about the questions you asked. Get a better translator than Google translate so you can actually read what I wrote.
@E39 Purist i said he forgot to mention the OS he wanna use🙂 seriously?
50W is garbage 90W+ only
Hate to be that guy, but the Ryzen 4800U is a lot weaker than the new 11th gen intel processors, and the integrated graphics are a lot more powerful as well.
@Shawty Yes, and I gave you the only OS options depending on the chip. And then you Rebuttled me. Don&#39;t be a fool
@E39 Purist okay, if you dont understand this,, let me give another example😵like my &quot;Ultimate smart phone that i wish for is Android with Oxygen OS on top of it and Samsung&#39;s design and interface but i like to have A14 to be my chip, since it&#39;s much more powerful than Qualcomm or Exynos or even Kirin chips. We all know that&#39;s not gonna happen but this is my &quot;Ultimate smart phone&quot; okay? So basically, the reason i asked the question is to know more about the software side that he wanna pick Coz it&#39;s obviously a different experience right?
@Shawty It can&#39;t run an OS without RAM!
@KidneyStealer Do you have an independent source for that, please?
@johnm2012 what ? Everyone knows that, Do i have to mention the USB type C as well? Yeah, without it i cant charge my phone lmao
@Shawty And I stated the what it would be. His computer is 100% possible, it would just require some self work.
@Shawty It was more a comment on the OP&#39;s shopping list of hardware than your mention of the fact that he hadn&#39;t specified an OS. I had hoped that the exclamation mark would indicate that. Perhaps it was too subtle. This is all about hardware, after all. I don&#39;t see your point about USB C, though. Only my most recent laptop has it but even the one I had 30 years ago had RAM. On the subject of which, the 16 GB limit of this model is rather disappointing.
@E39 Purist how?
@johnm2012 i mean of course i know it requires ram but im just saying the software side is equally significant tho
@Shawty I&#39;m not going to hold your hand and help you understand 5th year reading levels. Either get it in your head or don&#39;t.
@Shawty No, it isn&#39;t. This is all about hardware. The video itself didn&#39;t mention software at all. Though to be honest, it didn&#39;t mention much apart from the lightness of the thing and the keyboard quality.
@johnm2012 of course the video dont have to mention the software.. Windows is Windows😂













The lack of USB-A/HDMI/RJ45/Smart Card is probably going to be a deal-breaker for many, even though it&#39;s unbeatable in terms of performance/portability. As someone who interacts with customers daily who only buy ThinkPads, the lack of those features is going to be a tough pill to swallow. It&#39;s a killer piece of engineering nonetheless.










dont want to  flex or get any hate just tellin

Is there any specific reason for that?



















He&#39;s a proud American, you can&#39;t change that. Anyway this laptop weighs a little over 900 grams.
@imrankhan Ahem, Canadian.
Okay I got you covered on the next vid
@carrollusmaximus Shit. I swear to God I heard people say he&#39;s american.
imrankhan lmao. No he’s Canadian lol
@Yo Mom do I have to repeat what I said?
@carrollusmaximus isn&#39;t Canada in America? I mean &#39;is America?
Mamta Guleria wuuut
@Yo Mom Idk anything but isn&#39;t Canada in North America?

resolution of 2160x1350 pixels
2k. The youtube video he watched was 4k.
Nobody needs that
On a 13&quot; laptop?
It&#39;s 2K. On a 13&quot; machine this is the sweetspot for fine resolution and good battery life.
2k is an overkill for a 13&#39; device, but can be useful in many cases. I believe that 4k on 13&#39; screens is more of a marketing thing.
4k is useless at the moment as the hit on battery life isn&#39;t worth the very small difference in screen quality
can Adobe software run smooth on this?
he said it was 4 k so yeah
13” 2K with an aspect ratio of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> and a resolution of 2160x1350
its 2k <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> ratio
On a small laptop like this 4k isn&#39;t even a noticeable difference.
4k is useful only on external displays from 22in and up, 2k on a laptop is nice and rare, sure it hits battery life but it can be useful, although most of the time it will be overkill, I see it in my surface pro...
slighter battery life is absolutely dogshir and ducking 2K is gonna obliterate it
@Scbr24 u odia??
@Digitalguy 32&quot; inch is usually the sweetspot for 4K at normal working distance. <br><br>I have 27&quot; at 1440p, and it is borderline; I have no issues with it and it looks amazing. But a few times I would have liked 4K, but usually not for that size.
@Wistbacka I have it too, and while fine for me, I see the pixels even at normal distance, as I  do on my 22in 1080p monitor
Why? You literally can&#39;t tell the difference between 2K and 4K on 13.3&quot;. It&#39;s just a waste of battery. More is not always better.
4k on a 13 inch is like gold wheels on a prius.
I used to use a 15.6 inch laptop that had a tn panel 1366x768<br>Then a newer 11.6 inch 1366x768 laptop tn but was better then first<br><br>Then finally I proper speced laptop <br>(Asus tuf) with fhd ips 15.6 freesync 144hz
4K is not overkill at that size. The image quality is outstanding.
















































and break my new laptop? no thanks ill just use my hands
@Daus Throwaway Lmao, this laptop is Mil-spec tested which means it has Military-grade durability. But don&#39;t force it too much 😂😂😂

only if you can afford this baby

Because these are paid reviews
I think it&#39;s because he actually uses their products so he&#39;s always excited to check them out.
How do you know which ones paid reviews?
@Anthony Martin he usually puts it at the beginning of the video. I don&#39;t think this is a paid review
@Rishikesh Rishi no way these are paid or anything or else he would have to disclose it somewhere by law
@Rishikesh Rishi no way these are paid or anything or else he would have to disclose it somewhere by law
He just likes the product, organic marketing i guess
he also used razer laptops
Lol ya think
Why do you use FULLY UPPERCASE LETTERS on the most unnecessary words
Just a fucking shame after 17 and 1/2 mins of ranting on about his good this is Lew can’t be arsed to tell us the most important vital information of the price
And this proves why windows laptops are better than Apple MacBooks
Cricket England it’s not out yet homes.
It hits the marks that he prefers, go watch some LG TVs that he reviewed, he stood in front of the tv for 5 minutes in awe but sure, it looks like he’s excited about this product.
Nearly anyone can ask for lenevo to send them products to try out/ review ... He is one of them.

How is your phone heavier than 2 pounds/1kg? Is it from the 1980s?
@Joshua Cheng unbox therapy said that the laptop weighed around 500 grams but my phone weighs around 750 grams
@Vidit Deshpande Look up the weight of the laptop on Lenovo&#39;s website. It says 907 grams.<br><br>Also, what phone do you have? Cuz the heaviest smartphone AFAIK is the Mate X/XS (295g).










🍫👋


Adds 20 grams ;)













Has he ever bent a laptop?
Dylan P. No, I’m just saying if Apple were to have made a MacBook this thin, chances are he would’ve criticized it





Thankyou I watched this video until I find your comment 👊👊





@Pervy_Sage Dude 😂 Obviously it was supposed to be a joke


















You&#39;d be pretty excited too if you were making what he is per video.
@Kristopher Jon Cynical answer but true.
Show Lew / Marcus the incentive (money) and he will show you the outcome.
How do you know he was truly excited? He does this because that&#39;s his job. He has to be happy on camera.











Aren’t we all
First I was planning to not live it but then I saw this keyboard 😏
Oxygen left the chat
Read this same time he said.😂😂😂
7ىغ@wheniambored ههههه



















































Just a fucking shame after 17 and 1/2 mins of ranting on about his good this is Lew can’t be arsed to tell us the most important vital information of the price
@Cricket England I wouldn&#39;t go as far as cussing, but yeah. I wish he did include the price. But I guess he didn&#39;t because of the price differences in each country?



...and the poor laptop whimpers in helpless terror...
Does he do durability tests on laptops aside from like once or twice?
@Jon Stall He did it on the Surface Pro 6
@Commentor that&#39;s not even a full fledged laptop. He only compared the tablet like part to iPad

























ThinkPads are also offered with AMD Ryzen. So you can get a T14 or X13 with a Ryzen 3, 5 or 7! Really good Value and when I upgrade my ThinkPad X230 I&#39;m going with Ryzen.
@Aviators Dream but why even mention the intel processers let alone buy one, when it&#39;s a pretty well known point that they&#39;re nowhere near as good, especially in small scale devices like this.









LG gram 14&quot;  get 72wh battery





It&#39;s cause the hinge was a bit stiff. If it was smooth then the base wouldn&#39;t have lifted as you can see when he lifts the screen the base doesn&#39;t lift straight away. (:




Air? The 12” macbooks are 900grams.



Yeppppp
Okok, as Canadians we should after all... I&#39;ll do it next vid
900-ish grams.



U2










Cause thatd be pretty coool




It&#39;s lighter than the gram
@wololo10 Oh God, you&#39;re right.<br>Should have checked before commenting, my bad.














Would that be the Microsoft Surface Book?
You mean the Lenovo Duet (It&#39;s a Chromebook though)
Lenovo thinkpad x1 fold
Asus Mothership laptop if you&#39;re looking for an ultra powerful desktop replacement (at which point you&#39;d just opt for a desktop PC). If you want portability, surface pro 7 or surface book.<br><br>Someday, we&#39;ll have a dockable laptop (for those looking for desktop power) with detachable keyboard that is actually tenable. Just gotta keep asking.
ThinkPad Helix (discontinued)
iPad Pro with a magic keyboard?  Best part is you don’t have to run windows ;)
Microsoft surface series, although they suck they’re what you asked for
Google Team Lenovo Did that very well with the Helix, which must be a direct ancestor of this new one - so much looks exactly the same.  I know because I am still using my Helix for business use after 7 years and is was made to a very quality standard.  Thinkpads are just that bit more robust, if boring to look at.

you mean weighs less...
@Saidi Kaniki this laptop weighs more than my toothbrush






Then you won&#39;t like all ThinkPads, get a ThinkBook or an IdeaPad.




Lenovo pays well. Apparently Lew turned UT to a big advertising telemarketing channel to the highest bidder. There so many other thin laptops better than the Lenovo but no chance if they don&#39;t pay.
If Lew doesn&#39;t talk about key travel in the laptop then it is definitely sponsered .
He is the typing person, thinkpad series is one of the best laptop keyboard out there
Genuinely curious, but is there any actual evidence of this?<br><br>Especially when it comes to Thinkpads, I know there&#39;s some crazy fanatics. I&#39;m not talking Apple-fan level, the Thinkpad people are far worse. Maybe Lew just likes Thinkpads...?
G CNTech what thin laptops are this good?
@nonhkez see the time finger print took to unlock , Lew would have roasted lenovo on that.
@jdecicco91 ASUS Zenbook, ROG, ASUS ProArt
Great values too!
@Genius&amp;Mad my lenovo t490 unlocks with a scan of half a second
@Jerry’s Tagalizers you missed the whole point about this video and the laptop, the weight!!! not value
@Nonukez I have used Thinkpads at work, had HP and a MacBook as well. but nobody beats the Thinkpad keyboard experience. seriously. I think you have to use different laptops on a regular basis to understand &quot;us&quot;.
X C At the end of the day, The hp dragonfly takes off. Point is, there are many unnessarly LIGHT laptops. Light laptops are not all useful. That being said, anything under 2 pounds is perfect for anyone. And do not  talk about light before checking out the asus expertbook b90
Genius&amp;Mad <br><br>I get that he didn’t point out minor flaws, but how does that immediately mean “sponsorship”? It’s not like the scanner didn’t work, it just took 2 seconds. You could just as easily say he was enamoured by the fact that it’s a 2-pound Thinkpad, enough to overlook minor details. <br><br>So again, is there any evidence of this, or are we just assuming the worst based on no tangible evidence?
@Genius&amp;Mad It&#39;s a Windows problem.
Lantang Satriatama I agree. Though recently Hp and some ASUS products have caught up. Hp is always a downer but taking a look at ASUS, they have been getting better with their innovative laptops. I am actively tracking down the good and worst of each company. ASUS zenbook, AsusPro, and expert series are all good well as rog. Anything else is poor. Dell is the suporior in my opinion but other companies have good and bad selections as well. It is important to find the good laptops each manufactor makes. Generally speaking, dell and lenovo are the most reliable. The asus expertbook B9 has something to say though.
G CNTech Tell us about other &#39;better&#39; ultralight laptops please ? Lighter, and more powerful ones?
Quark Vid Asus zenbook S, Asus zenbook flip, Asus ProArt Asus expertbook B9, Hp spectre, hp dragonfly, dell xps, msi modern, razor blade. come on quark vid, lenovo is not the only company that exists...
Genius&amp;Mad it’s because Lenovo fingerprint scanners are hardware based, not software based, for security. Anyone who’s ever used a thinkpad would know that lmao.



There&#39;s nothing wrong with that...
@Akmal Danial u just said there nothing wrong with chromebooks🙄🙄🙄
@ayush singh  I meant to say that there is nothing wrong with using a laptop made by a Chinese company 😬
@Akmal Danial this has a diff meaning for india here






He’s saying that the laptop is very lightweight
I prefer &quot;It has all the ports you&#39;ll ever need&quot;.
@Relaxrr I am not thick. I already know what he meant.
@Relaxrr I don&#39;t think you actually understood this comment yourself -_-
JstormZx oh yea I read it wrong, I thought it said card board sry mate
@Relaxrr it&#39;s aight. I&#39;m not holding anything against you. it&#39;s cool we&#39;ve all been there 🙃 no need to apologise
JstormZx appreciate your kindness brother
@Relaxrr thank you. I appreciate your appreciation honestly 🙃 brother


















Yeah 😂😂😂
🤣 🤣
Bruh😂😂
LMAOOOO
I know right???🤣
Lol
To be fair, it&#39;s targeted at corporate people who are on the move a lot and need to type a lot. Corporations already pay for employee tech, so you could pick one of these up with company money easily.
@Kaustavmani Choudhury ye probably but not everyone works for corporate companies lol
Best joke ever
@Sabotarian If you need a device like this for your work, every decent employer will pay it. If you think you need this privately but are broke you don&#39;t need it. Where&#39;s the problem?
@ShiaLaBluff I don&#39;t need portability I need POWER like acer predator or some shet
@Sabotarian exactly. For regular people like us, it&#39;s a wallet breaker, so they don&#39;t expect us to buy one either. They&#39;re main source of revenue on this are going to be corporations and rich people, or someone who really needs the quality keyboard with the less weight, and doesn&#39;t want to buy a Gram.
LMAOOOOO
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I see a lot of Indians under this comment😅
@Jayesh coz am a indian too lol
I thought it was due to the money reference! Lol😅
@Jayesh no there are money reference in the entire comment section lol
@Sabotarian Sry my bad! I thought a purse was meant to keep money, debit/credit card stuff lol!
@Jayesh those are for lowlifes Wallet for intelecc
@Sabotarian Anyways NYC comment. This is not at a reach for the majority of Indians
@Jayesh hmmm seen many indians tho it&#39;s just the usernames which hides there identity with some dank memes
This is so underated😂
😂
The only thing lighter than that laptop is my wallet.
😂
Hahaha this made me lol
How can someone be so smart 😎😎😎😎



😂
🥴

I know this is a joke, but you&#39;re actually right; electrons, which are used to store data in SSD, do have weight, so when it&#39;s full it has extra weight. It&#39;s less than anything macro-scaled can notice but still, fact is fact
@Alex White 😐
@Alex White the things you just said are absolutely wrong. Where do you think are the electrons coming from. What if you downloaded the data and filled up the storage. This example was just to clear your doubt
@Alex White law of conservation of mass disagrees










The userbase would absolutely riot. <br><br>If we had it our way, they&#39;d still have the IBM logo stacked on top
Dylan P. Gotta disagree. I have 2 thinkpads and I hate the logo. Also wish I could get a black nub.


Canadians definitely understand pounds. Liberia and Myanmar use it officially as well.
@Peter Njeim Yes, as a Canadian, can confirm. That is true.





















Yes, mee too

Same situation here in India.....lol
Finally found a malaysian user. 😂

Mana ade 10k..kau ni over lah..<br>.<br>.<br>Rm9999.99 je
720 dollars a month? What? That&#39;s less than minimum wage in america lol.<br><br>Also, this means that laptop costs 2400 dollars in Malaysia, which is not a bad international markup.
in Brazil, <br>minimum salary = R$ 1046<br>and this notebook costs R$ 18.000

Malaysian here, i will buy this. <br>currently X1 carbon 6th gen user
@Gabriel Alves i feel you.




ASUS is byfar the only company with full io on their ultralights. check them out. Their zenbooks are suprisingly affordable
@Jerry’s Tagalizers My friend got an ASUS VivoBook like a year and a half ago and the figerprint scanner is straight up trash. It works like 1 out of 15 times at max. It used to be better in the beginning but still bad, it would&#39;ve probably been better if it didn&#39;t have a fingerprint scanner at all but had been cheaper... I hope their premium line (ZenBook) is less trash than this.
The Thinkpad X1 carbon is almost as light as has many more ports,
Buy a 10 pack of USB-A to USB-C plugs on eBay for 5 bucks. If you have your own cables you can solder them in, if not they take as much space as a penny. I always have 2 or 3 with me in my wallet lol.








Like on windows hello.....took 30 second....that was unnecessary

The weight comparison was too long

What&#39;s to love about the style (or lack thereof)? It&#39;s like they&#39;re making these things so ugly on purpose.
@mumblefluff yeah it will take time to get use too.... But still better than the monotonous vibe....







Be sane and go with amd powered Thinkpad.
@McQueenRLZ Very true, the one I was looking at (Ideapad Slim 7) isn’t sold in the US anymore .__.
@McQueenRLZ whats the advantage of amd?

I have LG Gram 14 loving it.  This nano missing HDMI and USB A,  which I preferred for convenience.




Karen, want to complain to the manager?





No it&#39;s not... not according to Asus website?








It&#39;s called a track point
🥀😏🥀
🌽🍍
What does it do though
My dad straight called it &quot;a clithoris&quot;
@murari vyas You know thats the centre of the keyboard without even looking at it
@murari vyas It is a mouse pointer... more precision than the trackpad.






Sorry to hear that :(

You&#39;re not supposed to carry thickboi gaming laptops










Exactly. Dells have a nub. HPs have a nub. ThinkPads have a Trackpoint. A Trackpoint works better in every way to a &quot;nub&quot; from any competitor.
@Aviators Dream ibm is a legend in trackpiont and first in business laptop line
Always called it a &quot;Lenovo nipple&quot;
@Trust TrackPoint.... and i am Thinkpad user also but using x201
But what is it for? Like honestly, what does it do?

Nesh Waren yes there is you can get a data plan on your laptop so you can use it without wifi
@Nesh Waren This laptop has a physical SIM slot....
@Ratchet Rorschach Yep, it&#39;s same as for your mobile phone.

Too bad Intel is taking the direction backwards.

How much?
@Kodah Shakur KS 1.3lakh









































@OFFBEAT GAMER supposedly, 1 gram





👀👀💢
What exactly does that mean (sorry I’m not tech savvy)
Yes. AMD with 15&quot; would be yhe sweetest deal.
If the P15/T15g Gen 2 had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> display, a Ryzen 9 5900H, and an RTX 3080/6900M (or whatever would be the AMD equivalent), that would be a nearly perfect laptop for me. Bonus if they bring back the third M.2 SSD slot and swappable battery.


@Tech Pro Logy lenovo laptops look bad
This is probably 1500 dollars
@Tech Pro Logy fr I had a Lenovo laptop they all have similar build quality except this one maybe expensiver
not really, its not that much... have one.
@Jovey they are business laptops  + it&#39;s an acquired taste, go waste your money on a MacBook if it&#39;s not your beat.
@Jovey How can you hate the look of a laptop, they all look so similar...
@Jovey lenovo laptops are the best looking laptops

I mean quite obviously it depends on the actual way you&#39;ll be using the software. If it needs more processing power, then you can&#39;t go too &quot;budget&quot;. I hope you&#39;re not doing astronomical coding lmao
Acer nitro5 best budget lap ever
@Priyansh Bhadoriya i like it that way
@IAM GRooT budget
@soham M what do U mean by budget ?... Is it less than 35000Rs?
@IAM GRooT nope
Ideapad 5 15 with ryzen

A light wallet would be expensive
nothing to say..
Same
New? wow! welcome to the fam
My wallet so light it&#39;s virtual
@Aniket Acharya 👍<br>Keep it light
@Mohyeet Inc I have light wallet too
Wait you guys have wallets?
I am going into credit loan for this laptop :D
Yeap, I deffinitelly could live with an other pound extra for weight, if you shave some 500 $ and give me some ports, because except for the wonderful thunderbolt, there&#39;s almost nothing else !
@Sayed Baqer Al-Alawi never interact with those comments
Rubber band = lightest wallet in existence
Lmfao
The amount of money on your card won&#39;t affect the weight of the card nor the actual wallet. If you are buying that in cash then who on earth are you, you don&#39;t you cash for purchases that big.
@David Milosevic don&#39;t
@Rjf the joke is because he spent all of his money

Would love to see a review on the new x1 nano Gen 2! Comparing it to the new m2 air
This guy is so fake. Makes me wanna throwup in my mouth a little
Just got the pro for my birthday it’s incredible
From that day he never stay in the same spot while working
such a big international chanel and still not able to tell info in imperial AND metric system ;(
wowowowow
Pounds…….. dam I had to pause the video in order to convert to kilograms , any way for the rest of the world people x1 weighs 0.900 kg according to google converter
It&#39;s funny how we call it laptop but almost never put it on lap
Fujitsu UH-X 0.75kg, and got many ports
Just buy the MacBook Air M1<br>Much lighter and better performance for the cheaper price
I want to buy me a laptop, a good Allrounder, which one should I buy? Budget no Limit.
Nice! would you go for touch or no touch screen?!

Lenovo is bad and poor quality.I purchased a LENOVO Thinkpad just about an year ago in Nov 2020. However, the laptop just started crumbling around the hingearea. Bad construct and casing. <br>Raised this with Lenovo and they refused to get this fixed and claim this is just out of warranty. Even when I am willing to pay, they now claim they have no parts. Bunch of crap and extremely poor service. Unfortunately, the laptop works fine, just that it cannot be closed or opened as the entire casing is just crumbling. I recommend that you talk about quality and service records as well so your subscribers can be warned. Thanks

You had me before you said,”Lenovo”

You have magic in your hands

After owning this laptop I will never go back to a full-sized cinder block.

Could you send me one?

These things have a place, but Jesus, Lenovo needs to get their classic T420-style thinkpads back into production

I&#39;ll stick with my Lenovo P53s Laptop ~ i7-8665U ~ 16Gb ~ 512Gb SSD ~ nVidia P520

Only two ports? Count me out. What idiocy...😱

who watches their own videos?🤣

Uhgg..<br>So you want a 50 grams Laptop <br>And then you go to GYM and train or try to lift 500 kilograms sh!t<br>Are people thinking, or they just fallow a hallow trend :(
china is making more advanced engineering products now no wonder usa uk all want to colonise china
Looks like lots of flex
Wow you need to lift more.

Lenovo thinkpad x1 nano

HI can you review Lenovo ThinkPad X13 Yoga Gen2 Intel?


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=08m09s">08:09</a> - Ah yes, the sound that clips your speakers, breaks every frequency sound barrier , ripples through space and sends remote shivers down brian enos spine


I really love this laptop. however I am worry about battery


what’s that background noise



Why people want light laptops? Until and unless I feel weight in a laptop; it will always feel like a toy to me


Bring it with ryzen and take my money... Not going to spend a dime on shittty intel


<b>Sometimes I get frustrated because of Imperial measurements. I have to convert every measurement from videos made in the US as I did here from pound to kilograms. No offense but just mentioning it.</b>
Real loud speaker built in a laptop?

Bro you have lots of laptop may i have one...

What smartwatch are u wearing…its cool
I dO not have laptop you have lot of laptops kindly gift me One
I have a Thinkpad but it old
I’m getting one for college these where highly recommended.

Mac is for people earning lot of money pretending working hard<br>Thinkpad is for people working really ...
Oh yes definitely nice😄<br>But it cost 2100$😃
Very good, but try lifting my 2005 Dell laptop without using a forklift.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=1m55s">1:55</a> 😅😂🤣😭 windows laptop mixed emotions laugh .. cry or slap his face
What was the take away from this review
I have never seen a single laptop reviewer in my life who had opened any laptop properly with two hands in the centre position near the trackpad. Everyone just use it as if it is a scribbling book. They just open it rough with one hand or on the sides or corners...that looks stupid for me/ any laptop lover at least.
ummm...where is WillieDO???
dont buy lenovo thinkpad, i need to wait 5 month  for laptop delivery. stupid lenovo. dont be like me. be clever
Me buying this laptop: Does MS words works in there.
dont buy it , i have allready sent it to lenovo , the laptop just stop working
Mfw I just bought the x270 but I want the x1 nano :((((

Is it just me or is key travel not really as amazing as everyone says? I guess it’s just the generational difference, youngsters don’t really enjoy key travel as much imo
Never buy any LEVENO PRODUCT.. They are thieves.<br><br>I bought a laptop Levono Legion Y540 on Jan 1, 2020. But within 6 months it started giving me blue screen problem. Due to covid19 and home from home situation, I could not send laptop for repair. On November 30th, when my work was little off, I called the customer care for the service. On calling Lenovo for 2 months, regularly every week, I got nothing. Finally, I heard from Lenovo when I decided to write to  Better Business Bureau, and a technician was sent to my house for the repair. However, after the repair is done, I figured out that the Lenovo has stolen my 1 TB SSD and replaced with 256 GB SSD. I prefer to use word &quot;stolen&quot; with a reason, which I believe will be clear later. I immediately sent an email to the Case Manager, Executive Customer Care of Lenovo about the same, and she offered me the $300 for that and rejected to give me back my 1 TB SSD.<br><br>I decided to buy Lenovo with 1 TB SSD for a reason and did not go with 256 GB SDD in the first place. My work requires me 1 TB SSD that is why I paid $1500 for the laptop and there is no way I will settle with 256 GB SSD. Ever since my SSD is replaced, I have not been able to perform my work and that has caused me too much of stress in this Covid-19 situation. At this time, the case manager from Lenovo decided that she cannot help me any longer.
im watching this video on that laptop now. :)<br><br>bought it
Is this good for students ?
Unlike for calling it a nub
I thought this would not be expensive but....
In a world full of Macbooks be a X1 Nano.
Salesperson

It&#39;s 1.99 gummy bears per square floobles times X
This dude advertises. He doesn&#39;t<br>review

it&#39;s March 2021 and you still cannot get one with WWAN.
crap
What is the generation?
The disillusioned lead explicitly scorch because party concretely coil unto a scared parsnip. one, spiky herring
Bro that&#39;s my dream laptop, only bad things are the hideous buttons on the trackpad and the fact that it doesnt bend into tent mode and all that.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m23s">5:23</a> that melody sound according to diag app is actually a code 0002, description: internal bus error, replacing the system board
It&#39;s like a paper bac book.
wow man chill on the lights
Wait... nobody complains how overpriced crap this is? Oh, righ... it’s not apple... haters aren’t present here 😂
Terrible acting for a paid content, i didn&#39;t get fool
Why buy this when you can buy a M1 for 999$ or 1200$ for the 16GB M1? can someone explain to me ?

All of those pop ups, reminds me of a TV infomercial
&quot;They took videoconferencing seriously...&quot;<br>Not at 720p they didn&#39;t.

Are you Koskhol?
The fingerprint destroy the laptop in 1 second
Like what&#39;s with the kitchen references. first the x1 is compared to a chopping board, and then it&#39;s so light that you feel like you wanna go to the kitchen...lol...lmao.
I&#39;m on my second ThinkPad X1, I kept the first for 5 years used it to death and it was still Stella when I upgraded, absolute tanks with top end specs.  I absolutely love the way they blend that retro design with modern minimalism its unique ,     The orange red &quot;nub&quot; its a nipple Lou , got to love the nipple
Still don&#39;t know why people buy these Chinese owned companies products. Prefer my Spectre x360 anyday of the week
What is its display resolution ??

My Lenovo ThinkPad X250 is still doing great, but this thing activates my Gear Acquisition Syndrome in a bad, bad way.

Can u review the Lenovo 7i  15&#39;

Preinstalled Win 10 and MS Office. Will cost me around Rs.42,500/- (After exchanging old laptop and other bank offers)<br>2.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=8m12s">8:12</a> Agreed. We should sign a petition to stop this harassment!!!
That&#39;ll be my daily... you&#39;ll see it on a coffee table down at the lobby. Someone at Lenovo&#39;s marketing should be losing their job right now.


The iPad Pro with the keyboard attachment looks outright ancient next to the X1 Nano 😂

If it&#39;s s&quot;light&quot; why&#39;s the price so &quot;HEAFTY&quot;


I need that wallpaper 🤩

Still have my t450. I love it and it will continue to assist me in my IT work for years to come. Also just got my wife a 10th gen ideapad, that works great for her teaching. I suggest anyone gets a Lenovo tginkpad.

Two words...... Thermal Throttling


Such a shame that between this video and the release of the product the M1 MacBook got announced and shipped


Good for programming?


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> full Adobe sRGB matte display is very nice. The Iris Xe with 96EUs on the i7-1160G7 will make it very good productivity &amp; photo editing


T42 was better.


Still not available in the UK and cannot see the touch screen version anywhere.


How different is the keyboard from the X1C?


Perhaps you do a comparison this laptop Lenovo X1 vs galaxy Book S


Front camera covering is super cool.


built quality is terrible - Problem with hinges is very serious. They can break very easily and they do so after couple of weeks.


Anybody know how can you link a second monitor to this? I want to get this for work and would like the option to use dual monitors


Why are there so few reviews of this?
thinkpad or thinpad ?


Please review the System 76 Lemur pro.
does anyone else think thinkpads are kinda...ugly?

this or asus expertbook


How is the Lenovo ThinPad E14 Gen 2?


mac air m1 wins


wow👍nice laptop❤



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=3m46s">3:46</a> see the SIM tray? - look all the way to the bottom of the display


What the it industry wants is a new enterprise amd laptop with a new ai graphc ore processor...
Can you please use SI units?


What was that start up sound?


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m30s">12:30</a> Apparently carbon is an &quot;exotic material&quot;, even tho it is in everything 😂😂

it isn&#39;t a proper laptop if you can&#39;t beat someone to death with it.  This looks too light.
Lenovo + Linux = Love
I wish Santa get me this on this Christmas.
watching on my x220 😉
Does it support pcie 4 ssd like Samsung 980 pro ?
Does this come in 15 inches!
What is wrong with computer lovers that find any laptop over 4 pounds to be heavy. I rather have  heavy and rugged laptop that weights 7 or 9 pounds that does not break and has all the bells and whistles and can last me a long time and a 2 pounds flimsy laptop.
Fujitsu
This channel is not good at all for reviews or even unboxing anymore
Lol the cooling is probably ass
In the video you quoted the laptop is $1999. That Cad?
Thin, light and the worst customer service imaginable. If you want to pull your hair out and lose money, incase you get a defective product than yah go right ahead and get one. 🤙
The sim tray may as well be on the back
Talk about the weight for 15 min. I was waiting for a demonstration of maybe some video editing and temperature monitoring.
This is not one of your best reviews.. It must be paid by Lenovo to sing their praises for 17 minutes... And your entire karma is totally missing here. You must do better man!
How does this compare to XPS 9310?
lew, can i have one for editing..
So is the NANO touchscreen or not lol?
Nice good video thanks for updates :)
I always watch these unboxing vids, and I pray to have a laptop but unfortunately I can&#39;t afford one, I really need it in my studies but who knows, maybe I&#39;ll have one one day
Panasonic has been making laptops this light every year for a couple decades. Nobody knows or cares about them outside Japan.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m28s">5:28</a> lol the bios that return error 0002: &quot;internal bus error&quot; that great for a review
Horrible soundtrack guys.. just awful!
I don’t buy from the people who ruined 2020
pup Pop OS on that thing and enjoy life
very light review
Where can I get one in Canada?
You missed the important feature of a keyboard: the backlight
How much is it
I&#39;m wondering if Lew have his own family...  Imagine how crazy the options will be for his children to choose from all his loptops 😅😂
MacBooks look thinner tho

Music. What. Where?
Imagine being the tech guy and never talking about installing a linux distro in a thinkpad

Design, fingerprint reader placement, screen ratio 🛑
Would love to see your review of the P1 Gen 3... it&#39;s the carbon version of their mobile workstation ThinkPad
can you do extreme gaming in it?

Where are the usb ports and the hdmi port? What about the lan port?

For my fellow non-americans.<br>1.99pounds =0.9KG or 900grams of laptop
When is this releasing??

Hei. Check account from MM Online Express. Looks they re-upload this video of yours.
They should redesign that Lenovo Thinkpad logo. Make it more modern.
Pound?!?

Is it inside the athena project?

What about the noise of the fan? and how heat does it get?
me with zero income and family living in poverty with absolutely zero hope of ending the dark cycle of American inequality:   &quot;Yeah im gonna get this when it comes out!&quot;
No USB, how do you connect an external mouse or DVD burner?
HI WELCOME BACK TO ANOTHER EPISODE OF *DRUMS “wanna know how poor are you?”
What does the nUb even do? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=4m02s">4:02</a>
bahh to bad this will only be with an intel cpu. but it has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> and i can hold it with two fingers? take my money!
اول عربي🤣🤣
Release date
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=17m13s">17:13</a> why did I feel like Lew doesn&#39;t care about the guy when he said &quot;I know&quot;. The intonation isn&#39;t as lively as when he talks throughout the entire video.
Meanwhile mine 2.2kg laptop 😂
The red dot is called NIPPLE.

I am ready to buy this thing but it has no release date!
The laptop&#39;s recording sound quality is good, but not excellent. The speaker quality seems to be better than that of LG grams. LG grams, even the 2020 models, have too much buzzing and rattling.
To bad, should be 14 inch
Um, grams please.
watch from X250
Actually type C is really powerful and solves many peripheral needs. But I think why many manufactures still consider to use multi port system is because it&#39;s quite expensive for now (thunderbolts need dedicated ICs both in the cable and in the input). Besides, even if they can switch everything to thunderbolt right now, there would be so many devices become useless. It would turn out from &quot;who use type C need to bring dongle&quot; to &quot;the whole old laptop users need to bring dongle&quot;.
So, laptop technology is pulling other technologies to type C, too. Waiting for projectors, printers, routers and any electronic peripherals to use that <b>by default</b> (which may come true still decades from now 😂)
The galaxy book s weighs less i think
they put 4 mics on it and it still sound like trash 😂️
How much do you get for doing this advert?
I Love IPad OS
Lite not light
Lenovo Thinkpads are the best laptops out there. <br>Too bad I&#39;m a penny pincher and don&#39;t want to pay the extra $500+ for a laptop just because it&#39;s a Thinkpad.
I doubly very serious doubly this reviewer says the truth, he just use weight to evaluate a laptop at all perspectives, false statements
Eat too much and not know how to speak
I can tell it&#39;s been opened before, or else the cord would have been wrapped too. This guy is being paid to hawk this product, obviously.
Why do you wear a cap?
I&#39;m gonna buy this and install fedora or Ubuntu, by erasing Windows.
Is it lighter than lg gram?🤔
The SIM card slot is behind the hinge.
Thanks for review, emh light and thin laptop, 👍
That laptop is cool
apple left the chat
Please use kg please please<br>Don’t know what PAUNDDS is...
Does it play Crysis?
Lets call it what it is.  Its a nipple.
Can i have one of these?? Your treat😁
Nice
How much RAM memory and storage memory does it have.
What is the release date?
try the razer blade pro 17 (2020)
My dad has this 💯
can you do a review on the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Carbon?
How does it compare to the x1 carbon and which would you buy?
This thing is 13 inch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>, so best laptop is still MacBook Pro 13 inch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>. <br>Wait for the 14 inch or even 15 inch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> T or X series.
Anyone knows when this is supposed to come out? I bought a 2019 MacBook Air earlier this year but my fingers are already tired of the butterfly keyboard. Also is there a new generation X1 Carbon coming anytime soon?

Nice video man, can you please make a video unboxing and explaining about the different docking stations in the Thinkpad line ?
Id like to see you compare a Lenovo laptop to an HP laptop for best bang for the buck, quality, portability, accessories for docking and removing for on the go use. I&#39;m a guy that has to have the number keypad as well!  But this product looks pretty bad ass.
I wish my work would buy these brand of laptops instead of the shitty dells they buy. i have broken 2 dell laptops because i got pissed at them for not working, while my lenovo which is 2 years old out performs the dell. so now i use 2 laptops because the one they provide has a program i need to use for punching on and off jobs, then for all my working needs i use my own laptop which actually works every time i want to use it. the lenovo also has a better graphics chipset than the dell in my opinon just for every day use.
I love this laptop so cool !
To the 1% who see this good luck have a nice day
Welcome to the soldered RAM life; maxxed @ 16GB. No thanks, no thanks; it&#39;s as if Lenovo is deliberately trying to piss off its customers. BTW, those dedicated mouse buttons at the top of the trackpad are for the trackpoint. You&#39;d think that a long-time ThinkPad user would know that, wouldn&#39;t you?
They could have gone even lighter by only having the headphone jack and Bluetooth and just including the X1 headphones with the package instead.
Your channel definitely deserves my subs!
lets be aware  that on the cover this little guy is bigger than his head
it&#39;s not really a good laptop, I mean 1400usd is a lot for such laptop and there are many better alternatives in lower price range
Hi there Unbox Therapy,<br><br>Don&#39;t know, if you have the time to answer this one, but I&#39;ll give it a go.<br>Black Friday is coming up, and I&#39;m in the market of buying a new laptop, and I&#39;ve been watching a lot of youtube videos, including a bunch of yours, in order to try to get a grip on what is out there.<br>And such, I think I&#39;ve narrowed it down to these 3 choices, within my budget.<br>Which one would you recommend as the best laptop for gaming and architectural BIM software tasks.<br><br>1 - Razer Blade 15 Base, 15,6&quot; FHD 144Hz<br>2 - ASUS ROG Zephyrus G15 GA502IV 15,6 FHD 240Hz<br>3 - Acer Predator Triton 500, 15,6&quot; FHD 144Hz<br><br>All of the above options with 16GB RAM<br><br>If you by any chance will answer, then it is much appreciated :-)<br><br>Have a nice day<br><br>/Tom
I want 15&quot; of this
but mybe it will bend easy because how light it is
Unbox Therapy is a place where absolutely any product looks wow and super cool :)) They should try to unbox something old and awful with their usual inspiration. More powerful than Apple&#39;s presentations :)))
how difficult could it be to build rubber bumpers into the corners of laptops?
can you imagine that not so long ago, there was a thing called netbook =)) ?
My FIRST laptop was a ThinkPad (IBM). That was SO long ago, many people still rocked a pager, and those who Had a cellphone- would prefer you paged them. IF you even had their cell number. Strictly Status. <br>  The track ball has got to be among the few implements to go virtually unchanged through the entire evolution- even PLASTIC, has likely changed more than this amazing, mysterious nubbin. So simple, yet it’s true powers still remain to be seen...I just realized how fitting is the name we’ve given the track ball- my crew has always called it the clit. C’mon Lew- I saw the look. Wondering is someone in the studio would shout out loud...like a proud schoolboy, eager to please the teacher...Lew Knew.
I think the sim slot is on the screen -half. Where the only way to access easily is If the laptop is closed.

The “nub” is called a “cat tongue” 😉<br>SIM card slots are sometimes under the battery.

“Thin and light”<br>Not on ur wallet 😭
asusbetter
Where can I order this?<br>It’s supposedly already been launched but I can’t find it in Lenovo Canada website yet
16GB RAM again :((
Can i have one of your old laptop? I really need one for work not in the best situation financially to get one. I really hope you read this. Thank you.
Not impressed
I hope  u  will notice me and u can give me one. Just for my brothers online class😊. One of ur subrscriber here☺.
You were surprised for how light that laptop was? So was I because for a long time the only manufacturer making so light fully fledged laptops was Acer. Acer has its Swift 5 at 0.99 kg&#39;s which is also a 14 inch touchscreen laptop. You&#39;ll surely have to check it out.
i dont know who decide to put the &quot;ThinkpadX1&quot; text with the red light on the cover of the laptop,and i dont think its the design team who put it there, but whoever they are, they have a special place in hell
Link to purchase the laptop?
Do they make it in 16 inch as well??
There is something so comforting about that Thinkpad look
Why the hell no one reviews Lenovo ThinkPad E14 gen2 and E15...
Great review...I am the same the keyboards..it is always the deal breaker for me..this is my next laptop..and I will use my iPad 11 for note taking ..seems like we will always have two devices ... tablet keyboards do not like me and I am always re typing with all my mistakes...what is funny is I still us my Lenovo tablet 1st Gen Bluetooth keyboard from 6 years with my iPad 11 as it has the build in nub for a mouse so feels like a laptop when I need it to be, but not a clean look...Post More on the X1 nano when you can
Prolly lite on specs too lolol
I don&#39;t get why having the lightest laptop is such a big thing I like having a bit of weight on my laptop. Is that just me?
If you could give me for online task.
Man, I wish it had one more USB-C port and a &quot;Yoga / 2 in 1 / Tablet&quot; form factor. But looks like a great laptop nonetheless!
Hey could you please do a samsung flex video?
Yes, my next laptop.
1.99lbs = 902g
Is the sim slot on the back where the hinges are?
PLSSSS DO THINKPAD T14 PLSSSSS

That&#39;s your problem. You are holding a WINDOWS laptop !   : )
Dell xps 13
What is the use of a 180° hinge on a laptop ?
Awesome review :)
Galaxy book s is even thinner
It&#39;s insane❤️ Loved your unboxing. 😁 when it&#39;s going to be available for sale? Any chances of release in India??
back in the IBM day, you can kill something with your laptop.
i only care about the price, which I guess would probably starts from $2000 for the lower end model. It only comes with Intel&#39;s 10 gen i7 cpu right?
This laptop is a contradiction to ThinkPads’ legacy in every way.



I miss the Menu Key on the T420 where the Print Screen key is. I work in finance and that key helped a lot. Even now when I pick keyboard I still look for keyboard with the Menu Key.
Thanks Lew! When will this be available? Yours is the only review I&#39;ve found.
would love to see an update on this after you&#39;ve been using it
Tiger Lake FTW!
Love it.
IT IS NOT A NUB... ITS A TRACKPOINT
Good!
damn lenovo. hire some designer for that packaging
i love lenovo but i do not like windows!
Wait so can I buy this now or has it not been released yet?
What is tha red button
200 mb of graphics !!
Could you please do an unboxing for the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7?
Can you configure it with AMD Ryzen portable?
Thanx for review!
wait did he say 11th generation core i7????
Hey Lew, how do you remap the 3 trackpoint buttons? I have searched everywhere for a guide, I want them to be something other than MB1 and MB2.

Lenovo be like hey lew hype this shit up.
So... when did lew do the video about iPad pro with the magic keyboard? Did I miss something?<br><br>Anyhoo... this Thinkpad is mad. My current Dell weights about only (let me check) 4.3 pounds 😬
hi have you done a review for Ducati 5i (14&quot;) lenovo?
No Ryzen version...
Love this review, seriosly,one of your best videos,loved everything about this,and that web cam and sound was amazing fo4 720 p compared to whats out there<br>Your honest passion and excitement and share enjoyment of this device was addictive,thanks for the share man,<br>This is totally worth checking out
Am I alone in hating Thinkpads? The touchpads are bloody awful.
Okay that hinge looks insanely precise and solid for how light that thing is
You can be the envy💭💭💭
why lew is saying pounds? canada has metric system..

cant wait for the X1 Fold and your opinion on its fundamentals, ie keyboards, screen brightness, andspeakers. <br>its form is already a win, durability is a nothc above any foldable screen (i think its gonna go over scale 2/3 on Jerry&#39;s pick as it will accept pen input just fine). its just the other stuff im worried about...... also the price XD
The more insanely light the laptop is, the more insanely hot it gets. Try using it as a LAPtop
Lenovo did make the Yoga book didnt they/ that thing is under 700grams. Then again that aint a thinkpad, more like a novelty that didn&#39;t catch on.,
I was soooo hopping, for this to be a one or two years old video :):):).... price wise.
it call trackpoint
Not sure if this has been answered yet but it is called a nipple mouse not a nub
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m23s">5:23</a> he&#39;s so spooked 😂😂😂
What is a pound ?
it still had windows which is quite heavy for my liking. Imagine with linux man now that is light as.
too light laptop don&#39;t feel premium. Like the MacBook Air is light and also feels pretty premium.
Will you please gift this laptop to me ? 😍
Sir.. Can u give me a apple airpod 1 or 2 🙏 plsss
Lol 🤣 1700$ for cheap plastic
i just bought the X1 Carbon and it was a utter disappointment i have to say it lasted 20 days I doubt it this nano is any better. I was using is regularly as a student and one day while watching Netflix all I did was tilt the screen using the bottom right corner and the screen cracked. And when the model first arrived I also had a problem with the right palm rest making weird clicky sounds every time I rest my hands on it.  Since I owned the old Dell XPS 13 9360 I am now thinking on giving the 9310 a go.
Paid promotion
This will be next laptop...when i can find $1700 on the road
To be fair, the old 12” MacBook from 2015 weighted in at 2.03 pounds...
It&#39;s seems cheao
Mac Air is leaps and bounds better.  By FAR.  Lenovo stinks
thunderbolt 4 !!!!!!!!!!!!
Is this going to replace the X1 Carbon gen 8?
1 m view wow You are tech Top Reviewer
The only problem with the ultra light laptops is you get ok specs, for just crazy high prices. Id rather have performance to price. But some must like them they sell. Unless i had a Lobotomy would never buy a mac lol.
Sim is on the back edge
Welcome to the “ I want it but can’t afford it” club

those nintendo switch sound effects
What does that red button do !! I don’t think it’s useful 😶
Lew: &quot;Let me pull it out....ooo that is tiny, even with the foam on it!!!&quot;

ew intel
I want this laptop so much but I can&#39;t find it in any store in Europe.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=0m50s">0:50</a> what is 1.99 pounds in kilos for the rest (large majority) of the world? Please use the metric system (an indication of the imperial system is optional).
MKBHD: Did you say Matte black.
When it will available?
Bit over-produced, no?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=4m05s">4:05</a> it&#39;s called track point, I think.

1.99 LBS = 0.9 KG
half a pound lighter than everything its competing with?<br>lol, expertbook B9 is 880gr or 1.94pounds
Check check check check check !!!<br>What ?? 🤔<br>You know what I m trying to say 😂 from my channel name and profile ❤️
Have to say I had a Think pad as my business laptop and the keyboard and trackpad was superb... loved that thing.

I love your vids <br> Love your content<br>Every time I watch your videos I wish I was you. THANK YOU
Laptop : 65 watt charger <br>Me: HOW MUCH MY CPU TAKE POWER TO SWITCH ON <br>CPU : THE WHOLE LAPTOP CHARGER BRICK <br>ME : Hmm nice one😁
It&#39;s 0.903 kg for us who speaks kilograms
Lenovo thinkpad becoming thinpad
Lenovo has one of the best keyboards that I have touched in my life.
i love this laptop damn i say its sexy
The shit show didn&#39;t even started and he said &quot;YOU&#39;RE GOING TO LIVE, LIFE.&quot;<br>I&#39;m closing the video now, bye, I thought I already filtered this garbage to oblivion but YouTube is stubborn.
You should try to review HP Pavilion Gaming Laptop, since you know, it is the cheapest gaming laptop with powerful specs. Just a suggestion tho. Plus actually Im curious about it
I tell my wife it&#39;s TWO POUNDS, and she has to say it&#39;s 1.99 lbs. SO ANNOYING, IT&#39;S TWO POUNDS!!!!!!!
am i the only one who notices the fitbit sense on lew&#39;s wrist
can you actually measure the weight on a scale? I am reading conflicting specs online with regards to the weight, ranging from 1.99lb to 2.2lb
I love it! I am definitely gonna get one but I kinda wish it could fold over like a yoga.<br>Then I could ditch my iPad too.
Is the LG Gram lighter?
Small marks on the filming lens :)
100% buy
Nobody:<br>Me: buy me 1 Lew🤗
1cm bezel? meh...
here before the comments start hating solely bc a chinese company made this
Why can&#39;t north Americans follow KG,KM instead of lb and mile like the rest of the world.
I have your cap on your head bro.✌🖒
I cannot wait to change my current Microsoft surface book 2 15 inches......... I finally surrender to portability.
is there a small reflection on the left side of the screen?
Wow, amazing!!. Youtube have double 15 sec ads without skip button.
Is the keyboard backlit?
Is it light from inside too?  :D
ngl , it&#39;s looks coolight.
X-1 carbon laptops are all light <br>👌👌👌
I would love to have the trackpad removed and just have the nub and the three buttons :)
Hi Sir Lew! Don’t want to be rude. Just want to ask if you have a spare second hand laptop? My niece need laptop for her online school. But we can’t afford it. She study well and have decent grades. Hope you’d notice this message Sir Lew. 🙂
Sequel..Do Not Buy Thinkpad X1 Nano!
The thinkpad will make a good tray
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m22s">12:22</a> Sim Tray
17.3 hours of battery life<br>17.3 million subscribers<br>😐
Lenovo has the absolute worst customer service/support of any company I&#39;ve ever encountered. Look up their customer reviews, they&#39;re atrocious. Because of this I would never buy another Lenovo product again.
We used to call the hub, the nipple! And when someone lost one, we&#39;d always tell them to order a nipple cover!
🙋🏻‍♂️. They should make a thinkpad yoga with a pen  based on thinkpad x1 nano ... it will be insane!!! Regards.
Nooo. I need to die peacefully with my both kidneys
i want this laptop please i&#39;m in india ..... i love lenovo think pad...... all thinkpad
For all europeans , less than a kilo 😅
Apple after watching this: write that down...WRITE THAT DOWN....
I do not like the new intros where you show clips from later in the episode. An unboxing is supposed to be a reveal but you spoil it by showing the item first thing in the video.
wish that theres a ryzen version of it
I&#39;m sitting here with my 9lb Dell Precision laptop. 😂
Stop saying 1.99, call it two pounds!
ThinkPad with that design is To attract the corporates buying
what&#39;s the difference between this and x3xx series?
FOUND THE SIM CARD TRAY <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m19s">12:19</a>
Too positive
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=13m47s">13:47</a> imagine you can have all of it in front of you &lt;3
Why not Apple Mac Book Pro?
I want this so bad
Why thicc 17.35min  episode for this skinny product ??
has intel? disapointed
Not liking the aesthetics, AT ALL
Can you share any video about Mapping mouse mechanical buttons
i hate lenovo preloaded software ... a big no just alone with that. NOt to mention the thinkpad branding is AN EYESORE.. EEEEEEEEWWWW
I am student,  just collecting money from 4 yrs to buy this😔
Super ugly though! Lenovo laptops look like the ones back in the 90s. I had hp folio 1040 G1 which was super thin, had aesthetic design and better performance!
Big X1 fan here. I&#39;ve got the 6th gen Carbon and I absolutely love it.
1.99 lbs ----&gt;  902.6488 grams<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>n.p.
How much does the guy in the back get paid? Just curious how much you have to pay someone to overreact to everything you say.
How about Predator helios 700😃😃😃
Lovin the red caption boxes btw
That’s a nice machine! Can’t wait until I can pick it up second-hand and Hackintosh it. Lol
The monitor is bad. Very bad.
You know he likes this laptop when he makes an 18 minute review !!
Laptop with sim tray? Do you use it for calling?
This laptop is lighter than my wallet.
That laptop doesnt look like its gonna survive his hands.
I&#39;m early and I will guess that it&#39;s over 1k$
SO THIN !!!
I always have that feeling of &quot;cheap&quot; products about electronics devices when the become to light... Am I the only one ?
Yet no SD cardslot? A dealbreaker for me sadly. <br>other than that it looks great.


Intel i7 ... didnt hear anymore after that. Let me know when they switch to the AMD 4500U which runs cooler faster and is just better
Lewis u have got to check out the Marshall Anton 2 wireless speaker. As well as the Marshall Stanmore 2 speaker.
Price?
What happen to air pods pro spatial audio video??
Love it!
I HATE THINKPAD KEYBOARD. <br>They switch FN and CTRL key<br>also sometimes DELETE key not in the right place as well.
Hey I would love one of those laptop
I want 1
Can you review the Lenovo Ideapad S145
Benny Neylon
The quick brown fox JUMPS over the lazy dog, not jumped (otherwise theres no S). Sorry to be critical, loved the video !
Even the x1 yoga already light weighted
whats the price, it does not shot it on the website
This is what the Apple Silicon Macs will be like.
I always had Thinkpads until iPhone. Now it’s Apple pie.
Think i would miss a normal usb. Is there a micro sd in the sim tray? What a awesome machine.
check Toshiba Portege laptops, those are lightest ever (850gm) business class laptops since 2017 with fully upgradeable internals.
When will Lenovo stop placing the Fn Key where Ctrl should be?<br>Forever typing Fn+C and Fn+V


lbs ... mother of god, could please at least put it in kg ?
Hey<br>U have got to check out the new hp envy 15 series with 4K display and rtx 2060max q gpu <br>It seems to be killing xps <br>Would love your opinion on it
this is cool
My fav is the OLED Screen HP Spectre 360 2019 model
I wonder how this compares to the XPS 13 price wise. I just got the XPS and it is slick! 500 nits brightness
Folks should create a notebook especially for you
&quot;Imagine that its slightly heavier than a 12.9 inch iPad Pro&quot;... <br>ya SURE, of course everybody knows what the fucking iPad Pro weighs...
price range?
Share a link to your lockscreen wallpaper please.
Is there Linux version of this laptop?<br>That will be awesome!<br>🐧 + (💻+⌨️+🔴)*🪶 = 💪🤩
I’m not a huge tech head, so I’m just curious where do they cut the weight from? If some one can let me know.
Where did this crazy man get one?! The box doesn&#39;t even have an MTM or serial number written on it! Some strings he has...
&quot;as I quick brown fox it &quot;
Why can’t expensive laptops deliver a better webcam
Lenovo needs to rethink its thinkpad branding and logo..
In Brazil this laptop costs 20k reais, the price of a car.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m38s">12:38</a> I was actually surprised how much it flex while just typing and few seconds later Lew says there is not much flex :D Guess my laptop is just super strong while being very thin

Consultants around the world: <b>heavy breathing</b>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=1m03s">1:03</a> carbon is in everything man....
Is the keyboard backlit?
I don&#39;t understand, why exactly you are not whining on number of ports like you did for Apple
hey lew try out xps 15 its a light and thin laptop too
Lew is wearing a Fitbit Sense 👀
It is not a &#39;nub&#39; it is a &#39;nipple&#39;!
The Acer swift 5 is just as light, and with a 15.6in screen at that.
I have watched your every thinkpad laptop video <br>Still cant understand why would you need a better keyboard to complaint macbook coz what do you even type <br>You dont have anything to type to
Not being funny but my Sony vaio pro on it’s time was top of range and is lighter then this
actually i would really like to buy a fat laptop instead of a 1.03 lakhs light laptop. it is totally out of my budget
Price ??
Lew! You gotta help me. Carbon X1 user here... How did you manage to remap the trackpoint buttons?
👆🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👆<br>Love from food india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Lew: 1.99  pounds pounds pounds lbs lbs feet foot yard boop boop<br>Me: <b>screams in kilograms/metres</b>

Laptop overclocking
I&#39;d have it
Holy shit 😲
Lovin the foam toss away camera capture. It’s the little things that make me happy...
What does that red button in the middle do??
Think pad series is really good but I really don&#39;t like lenovo support . No hardware you will get after few year . If your any hardware stop working you have to find the hardware from the eBay if any seller will selling secondhand parts .
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>? Lenovo has seen the light
It is TrackPoint !!
"not everybody use pounds, so if you trying figure how much it is in KG - 1.99 pounds =
 0.902648816 kilograms"

Amazing what Lenovo is able to do! I have MacBook Air (2016) but i could easily switch to this Lenovo laptop very soon.
Can you connect a beefy graphic card through thunderbolt 4
The  decision to go Intel kills it for me.  I would love a super thin/light, but I need more power than the intel chips can give in this form factor.  Good looking machine, though.
He is fake unbox therapy 😂
UNBOX THERAPY IS NO MORE UNBOX OR THERAPY IT IS MORE LIKE PRODUCT PLACEMENT
We need the AMD version of this
Slob on my knob
Love the matte display and cover over camera. Always wanted a Lenovo but slightly expensive for me 🤪
I am ur fan and I subbed to ur channel and liked and pressed the bell button am actually a kid I am 12 year old
all i have is a hawei y5
can u gift a good device?
1.90lb to kg?
I even don&#39;t remember how many time you said my new laptop, can you already decide which one you gonna use?)
Cant afford anything but still watch every video of UNBOX THERAPY ❤️<br>plz wish me something i would purchase in future🙏
The touchpad is a f*cking joke !<br>BECAUSE stupid people want button on the top of it. The surface area of this trackpad is very low. I hate people who use this stupid trackpoint !<br>Using a macbook once in your life and you want to slap people creating this trackpad.<br>And the webcam, like 100% of laptop are crap, because people never ask good quality webcam :/ it&#39;s a big problem for visioconferencing in the world.
Worst laptop its not fast as amd and cannot play games

what happened to lg gram
Lenovo is horrible . And its services too don&#39;t buy lenovo products.

Would be so cool if I could use it like a tablet !
Unbox Therapy
Can I win that pls

All great and stuff, but I think its absolutely ugly...
How does this compare to the 12 inch MacBook
Easy to break that Lenovo
Best Unboxing and first impression channel and the 1k dislikes we love you lew and Jack and hate you haters
Nub and trackpad buttons:  totally useless for the audience they target this at. Who needs those in a work environment?
That &quot;Nintendo&quot; sound on start up is a DIAGNOSTIC CODE!!! Something is wrong with your laptop dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Companies, make sure that this is my loaner laptop for work when you hire me. Period!
Why does Lenovo still like that old style keyboard design !
Whats the price Lew?
.
What about the screen? Is it touch screen?
Did Lenovo mention a release date?  Didn’t see it on their website.
No love for the HP Dragonfly? No? Okay then....
That&#39;s pretty neat, it&#39;s even lighter then my Latitude 7400, and that thing is pretty slick. The thing that worries me is the cooling and thus the long term dependability of the device. Manufactures are not thinking about that very much it seems these days. They design them to run hot... heat and silicon don&#39;t play well together. It&#39;s worth a thought.
Try the LG gram models!!

Alernative for frisbee  and throw to your pet dog
Asus makes the best looking laptops though.
Completely of the grid and still have connections to the grid network... lol this guy is nothing but a sales man and jot that good at that. People are just mindless sheep than cant think for them selves now days and can be manipulated so easy and this guy knows it and is banking on it.
If it is performant enough, it will be my next work laptop
can i have this for online class😭😭😭
4K at even 27&quot; is pointless, let alone any laptop&#39;s screen size. If you&#39;re going 4K you need at least 40&quot;
How many inches is the screen?
Wow this laptop look like so cool😍😍😍
Must video 3090rtx
Why the Function Key HAVE TO BE LOCATED ON THE PLACE WHERE THE CTRL KEY SUPPOSED TO BE ??????
Thumbnail showed me he was holding a sword..
oh, I love thinkpads!! I had all the models... what is the name of that red point? ah yeah yeah the nub JAJAJAA nobody noticed the lie jajajajaj lets be honest you have being a mac user in the past, don&#39;t lie to us. btw all the lost brothers are always welcome!!
&quot;You are going to live life&quot; is the theme if the video 😁😁<br>Me with out this laptop makes me question the life I&#39;m living. 🤔🤔🤔
SIM slot is on the motherboard. Pretty common..
I&#39;ve probably umboxed 200 laptops from lenovo, never have i ever seen a charging brick that looks like the classic dell round charger
Is there any privacy concern?
A laptop semsss nice for multi task in online class 🙁
I bought my Yoga 920 (with the watchband hinge)-- just as thin, and has two Thunderbolt ports. Runs like I first bought it a few years ago. Never let me down, but I have to say, the Nano looks good.
I love it
Paid spoke person.
That sounds like a great machine, thanks.
Man have you seen the Sony wh1000xm4
How thin is too thin? Will people end up disappointed if the tech doesn&#39;t invert space and time into itself?
I think all Lenovo laptops have that crazy hinge. But I always loved the x1 carbon line
I have an IdeaPad X5. I love Lenovo
nice product...problem is running Windows...
I really don&#39;t like the new editing style. Videos 1 year ago and before feel so much different! Not a fan of it but still love LEW !!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=8m15s">8:15</a> ... I also abhor the windows diddle-do sound. And why they make it SO LOUD by default is beyond me. If you go to the game bar (windows + g) you can turn down system sounds. I usually keep it at like... 5%
Nobody needs or wants a 4k video conferencing camera. Imagine being in a conference with 20 other people and everyone is broadcasting 4k? Enough problems getting everything to work when people are broadcasting HD. Not everyone has 30 gigabit internet. Also who wants to be in crystal clear quality when they&#39;re probably hoping nobody notices they didn&#39;t do their hair.
Does anyone else think that Lenovo thikpads look ugly/outdated?
Choice is a very good thing yet this latest offering from Lenovo is superfluous. Lenovo marketing will have a challenge with this model . As a long time ThinkPad fan I hope they accomplish their sales goals.  Thanks for the video.
Lew: There&#39;s carbon in here<br><br>Human Body: Am I joke to you?
How many kidneys ?
So much for a Business-Oriented laptop.
Really hate been poor
Sim-tray is where it always is on Thinkpads, top middle, so actually behind the screen when it&#39;s open.
A straight punch to Apple for creating much lighter laptops.
Like

Looking at this and I absolutely love it
no way this isnt paid
Lou has really become a lot more tech-savy in the last year and I really appreciate that. It&#39;s not just a guy opening a box. It&#39;s a guy who really knows what he&#39;s talking about opening a box.
I hate windows.

This is a laptop for very casual work. Lenovo already made extreme compromises to the 7th and 8th generation Carbons but slimming down the laptop. Big mistake. Laptops are already small enough. Any further reductions in size will affect functionality. have you typed on a MacBook? It&#39;s unbearable.<br><br>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not a good computer, but don&#39;t make this your daily driver unless you type very slowly.
When he threw the foam I literally thought he threw the laptop
Meanwhile my 17 inch nitro 5 that i travel with for work so I can game.   DAMN NEAR 6 POUNDS lmao.  5.74 lbs

If you have a laptop you don&#39;t need can I have one because I have a super slow one for school.
That is very inpresev laptop
It&#39;s more about the OS than how skinny Windows still sucks.


Who cannot bear that guy who shows really really disturbing math anymore???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> yeah the foam looked at least 5 pounds
hey you have viewers in Europe too. When you talk about weight, why don´t you also state it in kg? I have no idea how much 1.99 libs is...
I miss laptops that had 10 key
Bhai tere se jldi to techburner ne review krdiya iska
I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m going to share this laptop model with this dousche bag.
I am a fan of matte display too! I hate that all computers think glass is the ask. I do not know anyone asking, &quot;Can I also see myself when I am working? How about the background over it all?&quot;.
That’s alotta’ bit of flexing!!!
Isn&#39;t Lenovo a Chinese company? Why wasn&#39;t it banned?
We need a review of xiaomi mi 10 ultra, who agree
He did the Sheldon Cooper wow 😍
Sim card is below the back of the screen. May be

what other laptops in lenovo is comes with sim  card facility ??
The Red Button on keyboard called accupoint. It&#39;s works like a joystick for the cursor point movement. 👍

Lew, now you&#39;ve deleted the video where you&#39;d recommended Maglink cables, their website is closed after I&#39;d made an order a week before. Can you do something about it?!
Lg gram: I am the lightest laptop alive<br>X1 nano: Hold me

This new editing style is horrible.
I can literally make videos on this webcam.
Wow man
The hottest of thinkpads
It’s mostly the same as my L13
could I have a laptop please ?? 😭😞😞😇😇 am broke cant afford one
Recently my Lenovo laptop made a weird noise<br>When i opened the backplate i saw that the whole area around the hinges broke cause these guys think they have to cheap out at such a place<br>Never again lenovo


Why the &quot;pound&quot; exists? idk.
Just say 2 pounds, its so silly.
Lew reminds me of Donald Trump
me overthinking:which phone does he has???????🤔🤔💭
I find his reviews to be very generic, Anyone with contacts and money can purchase any device and can deliver Such Generic reviews without many specifications, I have never found any valuable information other than what all are available in the market and get to know about the recent launches!<br><br>Hit Like if you agree.

NO PRICING?! Kind of a key aspect. That’s always brought up with smart phones. It looks like it’s over 3 Grand. I could buy 3 MacBook Airs. I could buy a killer flag ship phone, an iPad, and a MacBook Air. Com’on LEW... help us out, or is this only for the 1%?

Idk man, that thing looks cheap af
Wait! Did he just make the phrase &quot;the quick brown fox&quot; a verb???!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m38s">12:38</a>

Great laptop, processor unfortunate
I think Lew’s videos would be better if they were shorter. It just seems like he goes on a little bit
Don&#39;t buy lenovo products

You can clearly say it&#39;s promotion video.

Lovely
what a trash startup sound don&#39;t trust this xD
I liked it before but I don&#39;t have faith in Chinese products or brands anymore for privacy and security concerns of my own!
how heavy is this as kg?
its a nipple!
Do you ever look at a populer comment and wished you wrote them??
Hi guys. Will post a hot video at 5000 subscribers ! :*
Forgive me, but why the fuck do you need it to fold flat?
Please make your videos shorter..I really enjoy the content, but I feel like you are dragging them out just for that adsense cash.

&quot;we wanna know what turns you on&quot;<br>Lew :


He mentioned he remaps the trackpoint buttons, does anyone know how that&#39;s done?
Have you tried the ultimate Lenovo C940 (15)? -&gt; i9, 4K touchscreen + HDR, Yoga, GTX 1650, 16gb RAM, 2TB SSD, pen (hidden in chasis) and dolby Atmos speakers. Yummy! I&#39;ve also been looking for THE one laptop to rule them all and have gone through the Yoga&#39;s, the X1 Yoga, the carbon and finally found the C940 covers everything in one gorgeous package. If you prefer the X1 keyboards then this might be the only compromise as it was on the C930. Have a look :-)
Try the Jlab go air true wireless earphones. £30 and apparently more impressive than ones near the £100 mark
why is this video 17 minutes long!!
A 900g laptop mind blown
I know where&#39;s the sim tray 😆
I wonder if he could climb any further into Lenovo&#39;s arse

Breaking news: Mathew Mcconaughey and Christian Bale sue thinkpad due to lightness, expert says.
What did he mean by privacy prospective 😐
Good for my mom to work on his office msword and exel 😂🤣
What about the protege x30L-G, which I think is 870g
can I put a graphics card in the laptop?
The bezel design looks nice but the rest of the design has been around for such a long time it kinda looks dated. Their Yoga laptops look more premium &amp; upscale in Iron Gray or in the gold aluminum
Why are you looking to laptop Sooo haard !!!
Performance and battery life please..
is it good for animating and editing since im not that good distinguishing computer specs?
Would be interested in this vs the LG Gram

Is this a paid review?

Two ports is pathetic. They&#39;ve gone full Apple in that regard, making it almost unusable without a breakout box hanging from the side. The T14 fits my needs much better.

Where can I buy this?

"So what&#39;s your X1 Nano missing weighing 0.12 lbs less than Lenovo&#39;s lightest based on their spec sheet? :-)  Nice review, as always!<br>Non-touch: 957g / 2.11lbs
<br>Touch models: 995g / 2.19lbs
<br>WWAN non-touch: 986g / 2.17lbs
<br>WWAN touch: 1029g / 2.27lbs"
Does anybody got Kingdom Hearts vibes from that spec stickers sound at the start of the video?
Should i go mac or windows ? ( im more on the mac side though ive seen many videos that the macbook air 2020 heats quickly )not sure what to choose
<b>I just tried to pull my XPS with one hand, OUCH!</b>
Don’t think price was mentioned, so went to look it up on Lenovo’s website—starting at $1399, but didn’t give specs at that price.
Did I just watch an infomercial? I feel like I want to buy this laptop RIGHT NOW!
That is not a nub, its a laptop nipple
Please also use metric system
ITS LENOVO!!! DONT BUY ANYTHING THAT BELONGS TO LENOVO!
First world problems: my laptop weighs 2.6pounds, I cannot live life like this, I need a laptop that weighs less than 2 pounds....<br>Meanwhile in Africa: I have no water, hmm guess I die.

You need to change the lens of your main camera or fix lighting, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m28s">16:28</a> onwards some smudges on your camera are visible
SIm card should be in the back!
I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t watch this. That music is terrible and to loud! This style of music has to go from your videos! PLEASE! Not wearing headphones/earbuds
Did anyone catch that he changed his watch?

Wanna explain anything about the Maglink cables?
Is it touchscreen ?
lighter than lg Gram?
Build a 15&quot; version or even a 17&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> version ;)
Weight means a battery life. So.. By the way, Lenovo&#39;s notebook keyboard as in this model is the WORST on a market. Key cap edges are literally everywhere! It&#39;s hard to type.
I envy you. Being able to use high-end gadgets before anyone else is amazing. I just started my podcast where I review products too but without the actual products. I&#39;ve been following you for years now and you&#39;ve just been an inspiration for me. Shout out to Willy Do!! 😂

The Background Music in this video really threw me this go &#39;round. Haha.
I used these ThinkPad throughout my childhood without knowing they are made for portability during work and job ._.
Videos getting very long and boring
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m22s">5:22</a> you have a hardware problem. Internal bus error. Might want to get it fixed.


Brooo the register to vote ads are annoyiiiiing
Am I the only one who thinks, this video&#39;s EDITING is Awesome.

As long as it is from a CHINESE company(Lenovo), I am NEVER purchasing it no matter how good it is.
Imagine how many new laptops he has.lmao
Will web can bear that weight 🤔 👀
And then it has a intel cpu🤨🤣
comparing devices on weight, but not on prices? I looked for prices on Lenovo&#39;s site but couldn&#39;t find the configurator. What does the X1 Nano cost...i don&#39;t get that he doesn&#39;t mention it.
1.99lbs in non retarded units?
Did they fixed the problem with the type c thunderbolt ?
never get intel integ. graphics.<br>amd is leagues ahead

I really like the new ligth set up
Mmmm ah yes the very exotic material of... Carbon?
Hope to buy a second one in 2025😂

The man that makes you exited for a work laptop
Lew, 17 min video? Really? I love your videos but this was too much. Fun fact, saw the entire video at 2x speed. It was much more fun and was still very clear.
Next up, laptop lighter than helium
I want bettery king
The box is heavier than the laptop itself 🤒😆
I hate how hard his typing is.
Plzz give me a best divac
What is 1,99 pounds?<br><br>Do you guys know Kg?<br><br>Most of the world uses that...<br><br>Could you guys just put the Kg conversion somewhere in the video?<br><br>Like, it&#39;s a hassle to go to Google and convert that...<br><br>You guys could just put the Kg conversion bellow the pounds one for easy of access...
Hmmmmmm a thinkpad with limited i/o?<br><br>Im bummed my x1 carbon doesn&#39;t have an ethernet jack lol.

I have the X1 Carbon for work and it&#39;s amaaaaazing. The only thing I have to gripe about it the memory size. It&#39;s hard to run programs like Bluebeam Revu and larger blueprint files freezes the computer.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=8m10s">8:10</a> save your sanity and change or remove the windows notification sounds.
My OCD does dot like the fact that the touch bar is not perfectly centered. It&#39;s a rare thing to see it exactly in the center, that&#39;s one reason I like Apple laptops.
Do the Flex14 with the Ryzen 4700U its the budget version of this thing
Man my external keyboard us more thicker than this laptop XD

Congrats on your new laptop although now the Chinese government has all your info, delete lenovo surveyor 64
Are u wearing the new Fitbit
I rejoice that you found a laptop that seems to work for you! Personally, I noticed some things about this Nano which were not so enticing for me. First, Lenovo rates the weight at 2.19 lbs for the touch screen model (and 2.27 if it has WWAN) so it isn&#39;t really under 2 lbs. Second, the display is only 2K which is a deal-breaker for me (I&#39;d rather get the X1 Carbon at 2.4 lbs with a 4K display). Right now I am watching--and writing--on a new Samsung Tab S7+ (1.3 lbs) which has a 120 HZ Super AMOLED 3K display and weights considerably under 2 lbs even with a keyboard. For photo pros the higher resolution is just too important to consider weight as the biggest selling feature. Also, with any lightweight device, having pen input is so sweet and adds tremendous value (note taking; drawing; letter writing, etc.) that I wouldn&#39;t even look at any lightweight computing device without it. Fortunately we can each chose from many different offerings to get what is best for us. Thanks for your great YouTube content creation!




Is it me or others too that are not getting notifications??

Ok i admit it, it’s time to upgrade my Thinkpad T60. The weight and size of the  Thinkpad X1 Nano is the same as my T60 screen alone... 🤣
Is that an Apple Watch? 👀 🤔
Sir, it doesn&#39;t matter if you help me, but my condition will be fine. Please help me as much as you can. The rest is up to you. The rest is up to you.  I will give, I am not wrong. I hope you will wait for the rest of your head to answer me.

&quot;17hrs of battery life&quot; lol, too good to be true. Lenovo batteries sucks. Doing the lightest thing my brand new lenovo laptop runs 3hrs at max. The battery capacity was supposed to be 30000mah, but upon checking via software the battery on full charge is only 10400-11000mah capacity and I am not the only one who encountered this issue.
Wooowww,,,. Price?

But you can’t really compare an almost entire plastic laptop with an apple laptop ~just my opinion

Is that laptop has backlit?
That looks insanly light 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wtf<br>This laptop contains<br>16 gig of ram<br>1 tb of SSD<br>17 hr of battery<br>Are you kidding

Have u seen the acer swift 7 2019

Future legends say he is still looking for the perfect laptop
do not buy this unless you want to be ripped off
that thinkpad would crack in half compared to my macbook if its put through the abuse my macbook takes!
Im a big fan of thinkpads too. Unfortunately I don’t have any of those, so I keep watching videos that I can’t afford.
The power on sound isnt it 😂
please try Dell XPS then think, XPS 4K display carbon fiber is amazing
not bad for  500 dollars
The real question is does the battery suck 🔋 ?
you sure Dolby audio was on? I have an Ideapad s340 and its really a great laptop, since it has Dolby audio, I have a lot of audio quality, I would truly recommend this for any budget user for the various specs there are, and it light :)

the quick brown fox is alive and well
Now you need the ThinkPad X1 ANC Headphones and you&#39;re set
So we sit through 17 and 1/2 mins of Lew chomping on about how bloody good this laptop is but NOT ONCE do we find out how much this costs .....  Why the fuck do YouTube’s fail to tell us the bloody most important vital information in any review

Umm.. what is the use of flat fold?.. shouldn&#39;t it be 2 in 1??
Love Lenovo ThinkPad yoga
Lew can you please start showing in screen what is the kilogram equivalent to the weight of the devices you are talking about? I think that was the most important aspect you were trying to talk about and a lot of your audience (me included) didn&#39;t understand it
Hope this laptop come up with 360 degrees flipping screen. Thank you for your great unboxing.
Whos here before 1mil views?
Can you imagine there was a time when the computer used to consume the space of a  whole room and now we have come to a point where the entire computer/laptop is shrinked into 14 inch and can be lifted by two fingers....wow we are in an amazing time

Fujitsu has a laptop called Lifebook UH which is 698g(1.5lb) and the same size as that thing
Can you donate me any laptop sir
1.99lb = 0.90kg
That&#39;s the best camera I have seen in a laptop.💯
love your videos dude much love Tanzania
Were those Nintendo Switch sound effects?
1.99lbs is 902 grams
You remind me of those infomercials that sell crap to pensioners.

Sim tray is on the back of the laptop, under the screen when its opened ;) @12.43
&quot;Exotic materials like carbon&quot; 😅
Can you make a video about some affordable laptops
This laptop will fly in the air comfortably🤣🤣
If u want to feel how much it weight is carry 4 phones in ur hand

We already have slim laptop a rather have connections then pay all extra for adapters. No body ask them .they do whatever they want with us  , new laptop&#39;s if something goes wrong you have to buy new because no replaceable part. What a rip off

I finally found the perfect chopping board for my dinner tonight......
your videos are becoming much longer than usual and this is annoying knowing that the same informations could be said in half the time of the video, and it&#39;s becoming hard to watch any of your videos till the end.
Rams?
Lew is that a new watch that you have on, because I can&#39;t read the time anymore ⌚😂👀
Nice review of a great laptop.Wish I could have one. 😄
Love the new edeting tricks and the camera movement and everything. The lights and fading rgb is kina throwing me off a bit.
I&#39;m convinced Lenovo pays you for these videos every year
How much is it?
It is lighter than  your wallet. So buy two wallet to buy this laptop.
My eyes.... I beg you, please no more RGB unboxing.
dont trow any of thease to downstairs. please i want it.. i am in love with this thing😍😍😍
Lew’s been working out
Just get a Macbook
Nice screen, now why can&#39;t Lenovo have high res high gamut screens on their premium $2000-$3000 Thinkpad T and P series, instead of 45% gamut 250 nit IPS?
(FBB) Wow.. <br>If this X1 Nano gets 17.3 hours with the intel chip, imagine how long it would last with an AMD.🤔 <br>20+ hours on a full charge. . . 😃
but if you don&#39;t notice then why buy it?
Dell xps set the standards with their screens I can&#39;t settle for anything else without a dam near full body screen.


0.9kg
The nerd in me laughed when he said that there is carbon in the laptop.
These RGB marco B-roll shots are the WooooOOOOooRST....
I&#39;ll buy MacBook nano
I&#39;d very much like to see JerryRigEverything  take a snap at these.... There&#39;s something about understanding what makes it so light and Jerry&#39;s methods about extracting such knowledge.
But what about privacy at last it&#39;s Chinese brand which have huge involvement of Chinese government
Why is your sub count stuck at 17.2M lew?

should i get the x1 nano or the latest x1 carbon?

A lot of money for something that only has two ports that only take expensive cables. Lightweight is great but it looks flimsy.<br>Hey Lew, do your famous Bend Test on it. DARE YOU!
I love watching unbox videos on things I can&#39;t afford.
Amazing! This is my dream laptop
Interesting laptop, I like it!
I hate the thinkpad keyboard. I find it so bad.
Thinkpad line is the best for actual productivity. I own a 14 inch model, but I&#39;m not ready yet to trade legacy ports for weight. Especially for professional use
Be careful when you&#39;re using this next to a window. The wind might blow the laptop out of your hand 🤣
No USB? How am I gonna use my mouse?
it is 0.9 kg in SI unit
try (dell) latitude series , the thinkpad competitor.
Lew: I can hold it like this for days!<br>Lactic Acid: No.







Kindly do the review of MSI modern 14... it is just 1.2 kG
My wallet is thinner and lighter than that laptop.
It must be nice having a new laptop every couple of weeks....
Microsoft really needs to step up their tablet interface game. Hence this is the way to go, 2 in 1&#39;s transition to a crappy tablet OS.
Lenovo? No thanks.
My brain will be lighter than my wallet after buying this
spin the laptop lew
hey buddy why dont you try out SAMSUNG GALAXY FLEX
those are some ugly b-rolls
&quot;Its so thin and light&quot; Can&#39;t go anywhere without those words following me lol









is anyone else bothered by not seeing the other foam pad fly off screen ?
Me with $25 in my wallet: No man, this laptop has just core i7, I need the i9 one. Next time maybe Lenovo.










Finally a keybord as per your requirement.
New laptop on table.
Weight...!does it matter 🧐
MacBooks got no flex at all tbh
Reason u need to have a look at Dell XPS: faster processor, huge battery life, very light in weight, sexy keyboard, carbon palmrest, and the thinnest bezels. What else do u want? An Apple logo on it?😂
carbon is every where :P
Hey Lew ig u will change ur opinion after seeing the Dell XPS if u r really concerned abt laptop
Another ThinkPad video
&quot;As I quick brown fox it&quot; ~Lew
I really miss using ThinkPads, but man that display setup looks abhorrent coming from an XPS. The second the X1 comes with an all glass panel and an infinity screen, I&#39;ll be back on it. I miss the trackpoint.
Please do a video for Microsoft Surface laptop Go whenever it arrives
Asus Expertbook B9450FA is about 2.05 pounds and it has all ports including hdmi and usb type A and type C. It  has also 24 hours of battery. It is also 360 degree rotation laptop.
Can you speak fast
Is this me only who watch unaffordable products or anyone else.??
I lost interest when I saw the red button mouse in the middle lol
dont like the first person cam view colours it doesnt match with the rest of the video
I love how you switched from finding the perfect phone to the perfect laptop.
unbox therapy x switch?!
The most important spec to me for a productivity laptop is that insane battery life. We all know that was done on the lowest spec version (seriously test that for real use). Still even if it gets 3/4ths of that it means you won&#39;t have to tether yourself to an outlet at all for even an overtime work day or long flight. Sit where the light is best and no worries if there&#39;s an outlet. I&#39;m sure the price will be the one thing about this that isn&#39;t light or thin.
Surface laptop go plz
I need a 17 inch think pad pro with flex
Nice
dont know why but webcam seem&#39;s pretty good though maybe it&#39;s because of edit but it seems nice..

So a tablet with a keyboard. Only has a USB type c so whsts the point  might as well just use SAMSUNG DEX IF U HAVE A SAMSUNG
This is the best of the best laptop for a businessman. Already for sales the Macbook Pro 13 2019 and wait to pick this machine.
The sim slot was at the back edge of the laptop, I guess?

which is better lenevo thinkpad x1 or hp elite book e860
Come on....why so many people like thinkpads?? There are so outdated in aesthetic and boring. They even have that red circle thing on the keyboard and mechanical switches that NO ONE WILL EVER USE IT these days...<br><br>Plus i don&#39;t think thinkpads can run heavy soffwares on it. <br><br>It would be great if someone explain it to me why people like thinkpads.<br>Cuz i personally think that thinkpads should go obsolete for real. Its too old
12 or 13 inch?
Does anyone know the background music
Check out zenbook 14 with 11th gen like 2.5 or so lb
Who else misses the old shorter format
my hp elitebook as slim as this
no usb ports :(

Bruh how many laptops will u buy??

i love your unboxing style
Piece of plastic…
My 9 year old laptop has 5 times more ports than this guy has
No USB ports, no HDMI, no ethernet ports, no ports for audio jack. <br>and you just said &quot;a bit of drawback&quot;<br>what are you buying this laptop for?

Is Fitbit Sense on your wrist? Beautiful!
rather choose Thinkpad X1 Carbon gen 7 or 8. Because of the I/O
What do you guys do with all the products (cellphones, laptops, etc) you guys get?
No but seriously... what&#39;s with the Nintendo Switch sound effects?
Goodbye Apple.....Hello Lenovo....
Asus Zenbook 13 &amp; 14 , expertbook b9 are lighter than it
Hi You can try Asus expert book its less than 850 grams
it&#39;s not a knob, it&#39;s nipple -_-

Lol, he usually says alot about connectivity, now the lenovo laptop goes imac and nothing.
Plssssss review the Lenovo Flex i5
I’m more of a MacBook guy, but my god that is a gorgeous laptop. If I ever had to use Windows, I’d definitely go for a Thinkpad.


Lew please compare latest AMD vs Intel processors. Is it worth spending more on Intel?
who has a hp laptop?
I wonder if 80 / 30% rule works on laptops so its battery cycle lasts longer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Also, why is it that nonsensical comments make more likes than those informative<br>and useful and readable comments? spews for likes I guess.
Can you please review the Lenovo ideapad s540 13 AMD 2020 version
I’m a fan of the thinkpad lineup so I will be looking into the nano! Awesome review 👍🏽
When he has those types of reactions to an item, you know it’s legit 😄 badass laptop!
You should review the xps 13/15.
hey lew is that a fitbit on your hand @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=4m17s">4:17</a>
the real question is where does it end? is 1 lb and high quality/durability reasonably possible? oooh hells yeah... we have materials of the likes we&#39;ve not imagined yet to be crafted.. the future of tech advance ments in every form factor is light weight.. durable.. compact and reliable..
from a design perspective, the top of the line plastics are far superior to metal in every way except for feel factor. imagine we could emulate the feel factor of a metal device onto top of the line plastics.. then you have the perfect form factor my peoples.. now make it happen Lue!
I like ThinkPads, they have student versions of them (obvioulsy not a X1) for under 500 € in my country with Ryzen 4000 processors. Unbelievable value.
&quot;As I Quick Brown Fox it&quot;
Thats 902,6 grams.
Why always in pounds ?? Put both systems
that finger print scanner is clearly laggin for 2020. come on now. its a solid g. Hook it uucp..
im concerned that the &quot;rubberized feel&quot; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m05s">5:05</a> would disintegrate off in a year.

Yeah and all i knows about Lenovo is their service center sucks. Good luck if your item broken or you want to claim warranty. Really, good luck..

"Samsung has been building the lightest laptop on the market but people seem to ignore them, 
<br>
<br>I once bought a Samsung Notebook 9 ( 2017 model NP900X3N) which is lighter than this one
<br>13&quot; &amp; weight 1.8lbs / 0.8kg
<br>1920x1080 resolution<br>Intel i7-7500u
<br>16GB RAM
 (soldered)<br>256GB SSD
 (can be easily upgraded)<br>Has fingerprint
<br>battery can last from 8-12 hours (depends on usage)
<br>Its a really great laptop and very suitable for students that had to carry a laptop everyday.
<br>The only thing I don&#39;t like about it is it doesn&#39;t support touch (newer model already has touch support)"

You should look at the xps 13 with the new 11 gen tiger lake cpu
The sim tray is at the back where the hinge is. roughly in the middle.


4 core  1.6GHz, 16GB Ram , 512GB SSD, 14 inchi for ONLY MYR 2999??
Looks like Z fold 2 :P
My 2016 X1 Carbon (4th gen) looks, feels, and operates pretty much like on par with other ultrabooks today.  It&#39;s a beast.  If the bezels were smaller, I would not look to upgrade for years to come.  I&#39;ve also got a ThinkPad from 2012, which I spent $100 &#39;upgrading&#39;; it now works as well as anything else now for general use.<br><br>Paying the ThinkPad tax at the start is totally worth it.
Asus expert book b9 is 30gram less than this
Omg! I want it
why even the most expensive notebooks still have shitty cameras?
Pause at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m11s">12:11</a> . You can see the sim tray in the middle between the keyboard and the actual screen
Did you change your video editor ??? It wasn’t Unbox Therapy’s style. The video was just too fancy -.-
Believe its called a trackpoint
Lenovo should pay you to present their products cause they really suck at presenting their products and lines.
<b>Thinkpad logo</b> honestly needs a massive rebranding. The fact they are not is really depressing.

This nano got me excited about the ThinkPad lineup.<br>Made me realize, I am a Blackberry and ThinkPad fan,  the keyboard is the common reason I love them both
could you atleast once convert lbs to grams for rest of the world which uses freaking sensible system!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you start doing cool gadgets again, instead of just doing technology.
The webcam is a good 720p, but still far from many 1080p even in cheap Android tablets. I still wonder what really prevents laptop manufacturers from putting a better, higher resolution or even higher frame rate webcam.
Oh my oh my, you can make a Kite laptop

I&#39;m curious why companies like this don&#39;t use carbon fiber, it&#39;s pretty light when you lay it the correct way. In world of cycling, most of carbon frames nowadays is under a kilo and yes it&#39;s usable and is using by pros
Which watch is he wearing ?
Lenovo is the worst laptop manufacturer today. Some years ago they moved their manufacturing to another country, I don’t know when/where but since that moment the quality of their products is the worst I’ve ever used. I bought my wife a X1 few years ago. After 1 year, conveniently just when the warranty expired - 1 USB port broke &amp; the charger port stopped working. Also at the office we switched from Lenovo to Dell after noticing the poor quality of the hardware.
Took u long to place that camera cover 😒
Ok...now buy me one

Hey Lewis, Unbox Therapy is a supper marvellous tech hub. But could you please tell me *how to find a portable (mini) real computing device*, something like hp mini? I can&#39;t find any and was just wondering. It should have 16 GB RAM, core i7, (10/11)th gen, (1-2) TB SSD, with NVIDIA Gforce &gt; 4GB and 3-5 GHz and no heating problem. Somewhat similar to the feather laptop you have unboxed. I am not a fan of mac mini tho. Thanks!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m21s">12:21</a> I guess thats the sim slot at the middle of the screen hinge.

Honestly I always thought Thinkpads were kinda trash
I love think pads but I’ve always found there speakers to suck
teardown na. hehe
Lew basically gets excited by anything new, lol
Me:- whats the price<br>Lew:- heavy weight
let me guess shi**y FHD display?
Cool video tech talk lew lol
Is the screen as good as Mac ?
My 4.2lbs absolute tank of a laptop Thinkpad T440p can beat someone to death.
if a macbook flexed like this he would have destroyed it just to prove it´s fragile
Only think missing on the thinkpad, thunderbolt on the other side and 1080p webcam.
I just noticed you&#39;re selling me this product 🤣🤣Damn you must be a multimillionaire
@Lew Please try some Dell XPS 13 inch laptops
Hey Lou. Big fan. But not of the new in-your-face red subtitle stuff...
I&#39;ll live with Macbook Pro for huge trackpad.<br>I wish windows laptops to have as good trackpad as macbook
Unbox, I am from India and I have been watching videos of Lenovo since 7 years now since I dreamed of a Thinkpad. If you are listening then donate me this review laptop. I can not afford it in this life time
plug it to RTX3090 egpu.
Only problem was going with an Intel cpu instead of Ryzen mobile. They literally crush the mobile intel in terms of efficiency and performance at this ultra low power range. Yet companies won&#39;t put it in their high end laptops for some reason.
And unlike a MacBook Air, the X1 Nano has functioning heat sink with heat pipes.
I will give you $4 for it
People don&#39;t really care about about the weight. We want raw power that delivers
Not surprised. I&#39;m a Lenovo enthusiast after all...

really nice background music. would love to know the name of the music around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m45s">12:45</a>. Any chance sir?
I have to admit that Thinkpad has also been my go to laptop. I love them so much. I used to have an X200 and x40 from my previous company back in the days and they are durable, high performing, high quality and the keyboards are so tactile and engaging. Now, I have been using crappy Acer and HP laptops. How I wish I can afford a Thinkpad even if its just second hand.


Im sure the nubs not that bad but itd prolly bother certain people. Wanting to pick it out

No bloody usbs.. No finger print reader.
There should be an all carbon fiber laptop. MAKE THIS HAPPEN

Apple has left the chat.


Wow this laptop is lighter than my wireless mouse jking 😂
Wow its 1.99 pounds... pretty cheap... almost too good to be true...
How much is pounds in metric units? 😂😂 I&#39;m having a hard time appreciating the weight lol


That’s a really good video camera.
I need one for school lol
That&#39;s some love right there.
that is called track point. if you know how to use it, it will change your life.
There&#39;s something like a faint glare on the camera lens? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=15m30s">15:30</a> Almost gave a me heart attack.
“It’s has carbon” yes and so does almost any other product in existence
видно сразу параша
track pad is too small for me and the keyboard design doesn&#39;t look good ThinkPad should refresh the design

WHATS DA PRICE?
I&#39;m buying this only because I like how they wrapped the power cable around the power brick. Nice.

Compare with X1 carbon?
Why call the ports thunderbolt?  When its a windows laptop...
Please 🙏 your voice is sharp make it have a little bit base.hope you understand
Me holding my iPad Pro like 🦖 damn that’s a nice laptop. I’ve already committed to the iPad for at least as a laptop replacement with the magic keyboard. I like the fact that when I don’t want a keyboard it’s gone.

Why would it extend all the way to the back??
Ugh I really hate that you can’t even see or preview or purchase on their website this is just an announcement
Today&#39;s word, buy.
Adidas cap lew really
not for 2k baby boy
Lenovo one of the best laptop companies. We use the X13 / X390 in our business. So maybe to step over to X1 Nano. Also the Lenovo updater app is so amazing..

What is pound?
I wanna get 1
Please learn metric units
Wow very impressive thinner laptop with intel&#39;s NEW 11th gen, but I doubt that the heatsink and fan could make cpu run without throttling I mean full performance. I&#39;m a user of X1C6  and X1Y4 10th gen experiencing throttling a bit.<br>Hope to use proper heatsink and thermal paste. Happy to watch your review. Thanks :)
Soon you&#39;ll type on your laptop on your knee and it&#39;ll just break in half.
You’ve literally been using lg gram

Maybe its light but i find it ugly, loving my galaxy book S, &lt;3 great review tho!
I love the old school lenovo thinkpad look. At this point they&#39;re sleeper laptops haha.
Thin light and weak. Battery small, material cheap, processor only 15 watt, screen small, non hdr option, 16 GB memory sad, no GPU is tragic, This is not a high end unit. It is a consumer device.
Directed by Lenovo 🎬 come on, it just takes seconds to notice how different Lew behaves, not even mentioning the text inserts in Lenovo-font 😑

&quot;as I quick brown fox it&quot;... 🦊
Plastic is half carbon half hydrogen. So carbon means almost plastic.
1.99lbs = 0.9kg for someone who needs to know
Aah I see, you&#39;re a man of &#39;paid endorsement&#39; as well
great, but it looks like your dad&#39;s computer tbh.
Are they brown switches or quiet black. Mmmm
It&#39;s nice that they introduced some device for people who want small form factors. This might replace my trusty old x230. Not only has it similar dimension while being much more portable, it also fits my use case with the headphone jack and one to two ports in use max. And since I want this formfactor, lots of battery and potability, I might be the target demographic here.
Ur lighting is a bit strange
although i am an apple fan, i do like other brands of laptops too, but i hate that no other laptop in the world in 2020, still doesnt have the quality of the trackpad like apple macbooks
Bottom I gues
Next best gaming laptop
The SIM card looks like back of the laptop near the screen bottom bezel.
What&#39;s with all the nightclub lighting?
I Love ThinkPads and Always say people who are working are using ThinkPads people who pretend working use MacBook. Looks Like its time to Upgrade my T570
4K?
Not nub, Trackpoint!
That&#39;s a &#39;track point&#39; not a knob.
Thinkpad gang
I&#39;m gonna assume while watching the video that it&#39;s gonna cost an arm and a leg.
I&#39;m just wondering why you&#39;re yelling all the time???
the &quot;nub&quot; is called clit i guess
shame on Lenovo that absence those speakers from their legion models ,and put crappy, speakers instead of high quality with bass.
Editor did an exceptional job showing the product. Gorgeous close ups too!

Lew, Lew, Lew, look at the camera setting and you can see what the resolution and what the megapixel size is please. I have a Microsoft Surface book, it has a 5 MP camera that is the absolute best camera on a laptop I have been able to find. I would love a Lenovo however they don&#39;t have good enough cameras, I use video conferencing for at least 4 to 6 hours a day and I just can not tolerate a low quality camera. maybe you could give us an update on camera specs.
someone knows the name of the tune at the beginning?
i really dont like that red button in the middle<br>or the keybard design
I miss those times when you shown the first unboxing of a product and the accessories included and did not show a unboxing of a box previously opened by your team...
Damn that‘s sexy.
For my fellow metric users, that&#39;s just 900 grams😂🤯🤯
Well, I&#39;m currently using Microsoft Surface Pro X and this thing is much lighter than this. 9hours working time to...
I want your old one ☺️
I&#39;m glad you value the weight of laptops. Tons of reviewers recommend laptops that weigh 4lbs.
Question -- Who picks up the packaging which you  threw on the ground ??
Why can&#39;t companies just put usb type c thunderbolt with charging on both sides of the device?!
Lenovo wouldn&#39;t touch it with a barge pole CCP 😷 MONITORING IN FULL EFFECT
Gotta have your nub! And don’t forget to tickle the keys
Trust from Lenovo
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=1m38s">1:38</a> that&#39;s what she said🤧
I love the color changing neon light setup in the studio which showcase this thinkpad to another level.
promising first unboxing and there is an internal bus error according to the beeps
I don&#39;t really like think pads, but the Nub is always something i&#39;d be okay with on my own laptop.
Put the sim in your phone and connect with hotspot that&#39;s what Lenovo means by sim
This is some good authentic reactions! I&#39;m glad something got Lew&#39;s juices flowin!
Is it lighter than iPad Air??😉
Lew: Talks about how light the laptop is<br>Me: Am i hearing nintendo switch noises?

Please mention in kg
That&#39;s 0.9 kilograms, guys
Im a simp for lenovo thinkpads.
I will take the MacBook Pro every time
Just waiting on those new bose review of both of them
Nobody :<br>My brain : I&#39;ve seen this thumbnail before
Lenovo is a bad brand
what is the heat like on this?
My 800+gram 2 year old Samsung i7 notebook has similar features, but Samsung doesn&#39;t seem to invest much into marketing their notebooks
MacBook 12&#39;&#39;   Am I a joke to you?
To make this laptop even lighter install puppy linux lmao
@Unbox Therapy - &quot;The Quick Brown Fox is alive and well...&quot; Lol. This is an impressive offering, and the Nintendo startup is really cool.
Easy the sim tray is in the laptop
Lew can you talk in grams and kilograms for you asian and other continents friends
Where the USB ports at ?
I hate how heavy the flagship phones are getting... Why does anybody ever talk about that?? I think that I&#39;d be willing to sacrifice some of the glass back for a different material to make it lighter
Bro
NICE ONE LOU, Optimum Ultimate Laptop!
1.99 Pounds = 0.903 KG<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>that&#39;s 4 iPhone Pros..
It isn&#39;t insanely light......u are just too strong.
idk if its just me but thinkpads are so ugly to the eye. It doesnt matter if they have the best keyboard or whatever, i just cant stand it.
Lifts two similar laptops and call it Insane.<br>Wow what a life bro.
I HATE the placement of the Fn key it is stupid and really hard to get used to if you use several computers ..
Acer swift 7 pro much better than this.
Why don’t you give examples for the thickness such as it’s half the thickness of iPhone or for the wight like lighter than a tablet or something so it’s easier to compensate for what it is.
Interesting
I&#39;ll use it as a mouse pad
ultra unupgradeable aka an expensive throwaway in 3 years computer
This video gave me so much nostalgia I have no idea why I love you lew.
Can it fly like a paper plane?
You heard that Jack?? A HEADPHONE!!!
i think this comes with just $2000

I’d appreciate  mentioning name of the thing at the beginning.
Thunderbolt 4? So Thunderbolt 3 isn&#39;t exciting anymore?
The whole video is just about weight

Personal experience “Thin Laptops DON’T last long....”<br>🤦🏼‍♂️😡👎🏻

How cheap does the Lenovo feel compared to either Apple device?
So does anyone know the actual price of this laptop? I&#39;m too lazy to search
👍🏾
Everything is good but Lenovo has terrible bezzels.. like why don&#39;t the make them smaller ?
This video title should be how to irritate yourself
Watching with envy on an X1 Carbon - the Nano is an amazing evolution for ThinkPads... hopefully they&#39;ll get a 1080p webcam and perhaps an ethernet port in the next gens

This video made my phone feel heavier
It&#39;s incredible how this man makes money from unboxing products.
2018 - this thin and light iPad can replace your heavy laptop<br>2020 - this thin and light laptop can replace your heavy iPad
If you think that’s really light then look at Samsung notebook 9 with i7 7th gen. Only 1.8lbs. I just wish they kept that weight for their next gen one.
Here we are again with the bullshit and marketing propaganda!
throwing stuff around, i see what u did there.
Any reason why they&#39;re using the little click sound effect from the switch during certain text pop ups?
That&#39;s a stupid review ....you&#39;re paid so good to talk all the nice things. I know how much stress I gone through dealing with Lenovo.

Didn&#39;t know people still used laptops
Lenovo Customer service is a big nightmare.... please don&#39;t waste your time. Don&#39;t trust me, check yourself on their social media pages and you will find out how many people are complaining about how bad they are.
Garbage product don&#39;t waste ur money
I wish to have, if i could afford 😂😂😂
If they included 360 degree hinge ...it wud have been the best perfect convertible
Hey Lew, digging the RGB vibe
I bought the thinkpad because of his past videos. Best decision 👌👌
in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m18s">12:18</a> you can see the SIM slot, kinda where the hinges are...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m27s">5:27</a> how long are your arms?
&quot;That is tiny... even with the foam on it ?&quot;<br> Basically mean, this lap is light even with the foam on it.<br>THE world knows how heavy Foams are 🤣

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=3m45s">3:45</a> the sim slot is hidden under the screen
&quot;The quick brown fox is alive and well&quot;<br><br>Lew - october 4, 2020






Why the colour changing lights
Yeah yeah yeah ... wIth soldered RAM. A shit this device is!
I preffer MKBHD because he doesn&#39;t waste time like Leo
I hate watching your videos because they are so lengthy.
Which smart watch do u use? Can you recommend any?
So getting past the 1399 price point for a slightly less heavy already extremely light weight form factor, what’s the point?
I bought my x1 carbon 7th gen because of you for college, and it&#39;s been a great thin and light laptop.


do you agree? Thinkpad need to swap the positions of the keys Fn &lt;-&gt; Ctrl

please stop moving the laptop... im getting motion sickness
Great sir
1.99 pounds = 0.903 kilogram<br>For cultured people here!
The weight goes up to 2 lbs after all your files are put on it....lol
Lenovo? No, thank you.
Is it for sale?   i imagine over 1000 USD
I&#39;m starting to think lou has a share in lenovo..

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=8m27s">8:27</a> way the four speakers sound i am not impressed at all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=9m35s">9:35</a> by pressing the fingerprint reader and the whole chassis bending in. It just does not look like a quality product. I watched it two times but somehow i missed the specs, and price if i did missed somehow could someone please link the timing for those. I do enjoy this channel most of the times, but this review is very poor as lack of essential info mate.
I like to call that the &#39;nipple&#39;
How do you remap those buttons?
I haven&#39;t seen a laptop with a cursor in the middle in over a decade.
Awesome!
is the sim tray on the back like in my gen 5 carbon x1 ?
So, once I&#39;m up to speed I get around 750 keystrokes a minute, which is ridiculously quick, and I didn&#39;t even get my typing diploma, would you believe that?<br>Anyway, I never liked the keyboards of a thinkpad, there&#39;s something about the weight of the keys thata lwaysc auses met o have error slike these. <br>It&#39;s been like that since my Z60M, so that&#39;s... Centrino territory, long time ago. But keyboard aside, I have a habit of buying new PC&#39;s, and second hand business laptops, just a couple of years old. Right now I&#39;m rocking a Dell Latitude E7470 but I tried the Probooks and Thinkpads and though they&#39;re all just fine, I always think Dell&#39;s Latitude range runs smoothest. <br>So you may want to look into those for your next laptop. I&#39;m sticking with them for now, they tend to not disappoint me.

Its in the portion of the top, between the screen and the lower lid, when its open the hinges place the display over it so it is hard to see while open

my 4 pound laptop is light enough for me 😁
草，美帝良心想！

Very nice presentation. But I don’t like the different color of light.
I miss the 7-9 min videos. There is no way I could afford watching a 17 min video with the time I got on my hand. <br>Great Production value tho, <b>keep it up!</b>
It&#39;s a TrackPoint god damn it
When the charger is heavier then the laptop itself 😉
How much does it cost though?
Even bigger laptops don&#39;t have that much of audio hardware.
Just give me AMD 4500U with it in here&#39;s my money
Here I am just bought a w530 yesterday and yes I love ❤️ it  and it’s helps me a lot with my canons lol
More than 11 minutes video.. nope
The thinner design = the worst battery will be.
Hi I have seen your videos for a long time now. I was wondering if you could do a video on some laptops under $500? As that&#39;s a more realistic budget for students. All the best some British dude x
i wonder who the hell asked companies to make thin laptops, its terrible
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m27s">5:27</a> why his arms look so long whe  he stretches them out?


X1 fold can beat all of these non dual screen stuff
That &#39;nub&#39; is a deal breaker for me.  I don&#39;t know how you tech peeps can ignore it.  It&#39;s literally a red nipple poking out.
I will love when lenovo release this design on the x1 yoga... Perfect laptop!
Lew sim slot is behind of it
No fans ?<br>No internals ?<br>No water cooting system ?<br>I want to see whats inside 😉
Can I have it please
He is like Arnab Goswami in Tech community...
Get that X1 Fold in there. I love this, but with the Fold on deck I just can&#39;t bring myself to consider a traditional laptop anymore.
its never too much B-roll
Nothing exciting about unbox therapy anymore..it has lost its way..more of sponsorship and less about unboxing exciting and unusual gadgets

Does anyone know if there is a click into dock option for the Nano?  Between the Nano, the Carbon and / or the Extreme, I am a Thinkpad &quot;fanboy&quot; who needs to click into a dock, and drive multiple monitors.
You guys are having orgasms over the weight ,but realistically if I&#39;m sitting at a desk I don&#39;t give a pig&#39;s snout which is lighter.<br> So I&#39;ve got an extra pond in my back pack, I&#39;m not climbing Everest or taking  a long trek from the airport to my car.... common:)<br>I like the feel of the sturdier built ones and how about a drop   or bend test????<br>Yes it&#39;s an excellent tech achievement but so what                         .<br>Cheers,<br>Rik Spector

Love these vids!
Thinkpads cost like a kidney or two
what hardware makers need to learn from Apple and Tesla is that it&#39;s really not about hardware, hardware has been great these couple of years. It&#39;s the OS, and software, god damn it.
thiccpad
While their look and feel did improve over the years, it really bothers me that ThinkPads kinda skimped on the versatility and serviceability sectors and became more consumer-ish. Thunderbolt and sleekness are all nice but I would trade them any day for a more varied port selection and more swapable components, especially the battery.
Is Lew wearing a fitbit?
&quot;LENOLOU LIKES TO THINK&quot;
This one&#39;s a keeper.  The price, internal and port specs.  This is probably one I&#39;m going to recommend at work.  Too bad so many people picked up new laptops about 3 to 5 months ago.  Still some straglers, though.  Two 👍👍 for this one.

@loulater do you want to take the mystery smartphone photo challenge? Go to my channel to see if you can tell what mystery smartphone vs the Mi 10 Ultra. Leave a comment with your answer.  Are you tech savvy?
Who really needs an ultra light laptop? Eat some meat and get some strength in those arms 😆

Do you normally use your laptop under disco lights or something?
I don&#39;t buy Lenovo. My daughter&#39;s Yogabook didn&#39;t last two years and support for every device isn&#39;t that good after a while.
The battery life is trash I bet
you love a good keyboard, but why don&#39;t you spend some time to learn typing with all fingers? it will definitely improve your experience and speed.
that&#39;s some pro-level filmmaking wow
Sir what u do of thing after unboxing?
but does it have beat audio quality and windnow 10 pro with radeon latest graphic akak my latop

@Unbox Therapy. U really an Apple Hater.

Nub? I believe the term is laptop nipple
Lenovo 😂😂😂😂
f*ck you man, now im in love... :&#39;(
I want one please!!
No force touch glass trackpad, not buying.
My asus zenbook from 2017 (i5  7th gen, 8gram m.2 SSD ) is as thinner and weights 1kg..  from 2017... I&#39;m not saying the Lenovo is bad.. but it&#39;s not something that &quot;New&quot; in terms of specs.. maybe just updated
Do review on Fitbit sense
It almost the whole video, but he found the sim card tray
Where&#39;s the sim tray? At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=6m24s">6:24</a>
Is this a Promotional video ??
Is it in the charger brick? That would be brilliant for power and weight management
Nothing exciting:/ really intel is such a disappointment to the point thats its killing all excitement.<br>Sure is looking nice but... whats the point of buying old 14 nm technology?<br>And paying 2k euros for it...
how much will it cost? I&#39;m liking the size and the battery life, but I wouldn&#39;t pay the same as an X1 Carbon, this one at least has to cost 200-300 bucks less
1.99 pounds in non retard units ?
Love the new format!
The quick brown fox
My Tower is heavy AF and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.
What is wrong with people? Look at that garbage keyboard and that stupid red ball mouse thing. I cannot think of a major premium laptop I would hate using more than a ThinkPad. This thing is ugly to a point that it is a hindrance to its use. Also, the startup sound was awful. It is 2020 people.
Please use the metric system 🙏<br>-The world









If you can curl at least 90 lbs, a 3 lbs laptop with an all day battery won&#39;t kill you. Give me a fat a** battery and a larger screen any day. I miss those 17&quot;  laptops. I don&#39;t get this fascination with making everything lighter.
Lite is not always right!<br>Cheers,<br>Rik Spector
guys pls don&#39;t do drugs<br>thanks in advance
Can you use metric units please? You&#39;re looking for innovation but using legacy, that&#39;s kinda strange for me 😅
I’ve been collecting 2 years for a laptop and this mustache has a new one every other week
Is this lighter than LG Gram 15.6?
I think you should continue to show the webcam/microphone quality for every laptop you get.
Great intro
But, I think sometimes weight must mean quality for me
Get your here before 40 million ticket here 😂

That thing is lighter than my keyboard
It&#39;s 900 grams (Almost 1 kg) for people who are not in USA.
Me : tries to stay 17.4 hours on the laptop<br>Lenovo : we don&#39;t do that here.
there are lighter samsung laptops...
Nice , I think how much thick would the buttone would be.
Seal was broken, return product... 😔😔😔
Lenovo is trash except their legion laptops
Am I the only one that is cleaning his tears and watching this video from his Thinkpad T440p cuz poor?
screen 4K..?





















900 grams for the  other 197 countries in the world that don&#39;t use imperial 😂. That&#39;s light.
Nice foam flipping shot!
My ThinkPad X1 carbon has overheating problems. As well as my previous lenovo laptop. Fans run extremeley load for low loads and runs hot. Hit like if this is a problem for you as well.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=0m50s">0:50</a> it&#39;s 0.903 kg
Is coming with all wallpapers crezy but is a good laptop .
이제 LG그램 망했네ㅋㅋ
Trying to work 4K or 8K videos with that it will burn up like Flash paper.
Should had amd chip to cut even more weight from heatsink
Why not compare to the LG Gram?🙂 both are light I guess😂
Lenovo 💪😍
Just throw it in the trash - easy 0lbs weightless design.
Only a iOS developer knows the pain
Am I the only one bothered by the extremely annoying background lights in B-roll?
do they have an x1 nano with pen support. not really interested if 360 hinges but i am interested in pen support and thinkpad because i use the trackpoint
Cooo
it is a good package but the dell carbon fiber latitude really gets me
Trackpoint= nub, nipple, red thingy.
When it gonna be available in the market?
Why didn&#39;t you unbox xps 17 yet ?
The nub is like clitoris
fingerprint is slow as compare to other lenovo products
What is the price?
The sim-tray is at the back of the laptop.
Plot twist it’s actually heavy but he wants to flex.
MKBHD: I have Robotic Camera to shoot Crisp movement shots.<br>UnBT: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=7m05s">7:05</a>
surely lenovo pays him ..
Amazing video quality
Why does background music sound like something from Phoenix Wright
The packaging <br>🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
1.99 lb ~= 0.9 kg for non retarded unit system...
Your wallet won&#39;t get hurt if you don&#39;t have one.
Always that stupid red chit on the keyboard
It would be cool if there was a port on each side rather than both on the same side...
Fan noise? Audio latency? Resolution scaling on 13&quot; screen for comfortable reading? Missed a few aspects in the review. Lots of chat about the weight...we get it...its light..doesnt need several hours on that point. Hopefully its covered in more detail on other youtube channels.
Now put an amd processor in there and it would be perfect
Something about its presentation and boot up seems cheap.  Would rather have a Dell or RBS.
I got crazy about this laptop and bought it. You&#39;ll love it until the skin starts peeling off all over the laptop. The warranty will not cover the peeling off as they consider it as a cosmetic damage. Super light and nice, but disappointing quality.
Please do the new Bose quiet comfort earbuds.
17 minutes talking about how light it is ..... show us how it performs
Why don&#39;t you mention those in metric system, you people use imperial system, but give us a metric measurements.
They really like the Nintendo switch effect sounds
I hate the editing
Razer Blade stealth 13 inch 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
cutting board is thicker than that
heh lol, have the same laptop in a previous version
Oh boy, that looks very practical 😮
Future is here🔥
imagine slaping your brother with this laptop so easy


Lew always handles expensive devices like it&#39;s just a piece of paper
You should review the manufacturing defects too, I just bought Lenovo Yoga C940 and it is a disaster and after checking online I found that it&#39;s a common issue worldwide on the same model without proper online support. these manufacturers are enjoying that you are promoting their products while it is a seriously bad unit. please give them hard time so they don&#39;t only &quot;SELL&quot;.
Expensive frisbeeee.....
HD 720p.
i use thinkpad too but x201. wery old but feels great for today....
All comment and like is real fan on this channel

Finally, now i can spin the laptop on my fingers



Is it just me, or do I hear Nintendo Switch sound effects.
Someone someday is gonna throw away the box, thinking that it&#39;s empty
heating issue isn’t it
Hm. Could i get your old laptop. My daily driver for portable streaming and stuff is an 10 year old Samsung RV511. Could really use some processing power
I don&#39;t think I will ever care about laptop speakers, as long as there&#39;s something. I always plug in speakers or a set of headphones.
Rather carry an extra 0.5lbs XPS 13 with a smaller footprint and bigger screen.
the new insanely expensive underpowered laptop
What is pounds ??<br>🙄
There&#39;s someone in the background messing around on a bontempi organ - putting me right off. Nice laptop though.
Am I the only one who noticed a new style intro in very videos😂😂😂😂😒😒😒😒
The way he swings it up and down makes me wanna hold it and throw it like a frisbee<br>woooooooooshhhhhhhhhh
main thing is that it is a chineese product and nobody should use it
You have to stop to use laptop and use surface in your table!
I was super excited for this until I realised it will cost 1400!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m37s">12:37</a> I&#39;ve never heard anyone use &quot;quick brown fox&quot; as a verb LOL
Here’s the thing, I don’t understand why you need a laptop this light, do you really have that much trouble moving 5-10 pounds?

ThinkPad strikes again
I have been using X1 carbon for over two years now and it’s a great laptop and the way it’s built is great. But Lew I felt was trying to oversell this. 😒
Nice Laptop!!!
Alternate name for the laptop: <b>thin boii</b>

16/10 aspect ratio 😑
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=1m40s">1:40</a> like the foam weighs a ton 😂
Now pass that GRAM to me.
Why is every thinkpad so ugly?
do the samsung books
Yeah thats gonna be insanely expensive
Sim tray is at the back.
lew is officially a windows boi now lol! 😀
What is the recommended keyboard keys mapping app?
cant you say it in kg wtf
You should do the foldable version of this thinkpad. The thinkpad x1 fold. I’d love to see that video.
lenovo has really nice laptops. No doubt they are the most-selling computer brand.
can  you open and show the inside of the laptop and upgrade options also...
LG gram
Could you offer that to me
The lighting was so overbearing man, chill out with it
Love it but can&#39;t ditch the eithernet port
Do this moves with my l540 and u break your wrist!
That laptop is awesome. 😭 Can you give me one? 😳😇. It will be a good help for me for online class. I&#39;m from Philippines.
If you guys have 2m29s left, can you please tell me what you think about my new single &#39;Breach&#39; ? It helps a lot &lt;3
Common man... it doesn&#39;t have backlit keyboards are you kidding me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=4m01s">4:01</a> That red is called nipple button, my friend.
I&#39;m pumped😁
THESE AIN&#39;T REVIEWS NOMORE THESE ARE PAID ADS GALORE
THE SIM TRAY IS IN THE BACK
One thing everyone needs to understand is that, someone who is going to buy a macbook actually will only buy a macbook no matter how pity it compares to other device
You don&#39;t have to compre that shit with Macbook Air. What about the durability? Compare these two after to years and see the existence 😃
How is Willie do doing How is your son as well
Thank Jebus for a FFWD button with this guy.
Kind a like it but there is a but, i have some specification and this one doesn&#39;t meet that so am not going to make my wallet lighter
Pramod 😂😂😂
A laptop that can be used as a Frisbee
Is there a touch screen at all?
Hilly who, hilly who, hilly who, hilly who. Hilly who, hilly who?
i dunno why but i like my laptop a little heavy
Fitbit sence i see?
The think pad series are the best in line ,never disappoints!!
These mainstream OEMS really need to get their head out their asses and start using AMD in productivity laptops as well.  <br>As somewhat of a Lenovo fan boy, they really need to bring some more AMD options.
So what if it falls flat? Do you look at it from above? HAHAHA There are better laptops that fold backwards or into a tent 😂
Hi,<br>Please make shorter videos lile before. <br>Not liking the this new long video plan!
Always has been
Just 2200 bucks. Nbd...lol
It doesn&#39;t even really fall flat 😑 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=3m45s">3:45</a>
lg : gram<br>lenovo : pound

Get ready to get sued by Nintendo by using their Nintendo Switch&#39;s Menu Clicks

1.99 pounds🤣 is it a disguised t shirt or what.<br>The lightest laptop is also the super cheapest laptop.
Can i get that pls
This is a true &#39;thin and light laptop&#39;
Why do I feel sometimes that he is a brand AMBASSADOR OR Something of Lenovo, THINKPAD















This laptop is lighter than my phone wutt?!



Lew: Trackpoint lol
Make shorter videos😄
Can you compare with asus expertbook B9450?<br>It is also lightweight and have 24 hours battery life claim
whqt about LG gram ?
Rip the LG Gram lol
1 hour club

Cpu Throttling for sure.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=1m51s">1:51</a> when he started swaying it around I was stunned bruhh🔥
After looking at the price, I&#39;ll stick with saving for my dream gaming PC.

Seen The red button and Instantly knew its a thinkpad
I just want a microsd slot, if they&#39;ve got lte why couldn&#39;t they include a combo slot, just that and it&#39;d be perfect

Lew said pounds. Like dude you are a proud Canadian use Kilos like a proud boy from the north.
What&#39;s the point of these stupid unboxings if you&#39;ve already opened the fukkin box and pretending like it&#39;s your first time holding the thing
Does it bend

Um, LG Gram says hello.
how else watches but never buys
Have you ever tried LG Gram?) (rhetorical)<br>My 15 inch Gram is about 2lbs.<br>Of course the build quality is not the same but weight and all the necessary ports... <br>Also 13 inch too small for everything. This size is from the past when 13 inch laptops were around 2kg and having 15 inch was way too heavy to carry.<br><br>P.S. Thinkpad is very very fluffy to touch
Lenovo no thx.ASUS best
$5,000 price tag
0.903 kilogram
It’s nice, but realistically, if that was an Apple product he’d be starting a new bendgate


no 4k res this time??
Damn 👦 boy
Unbelievable!!
For the rest of the world it weights 903g.
So seeing this made me go onto Lenovo website and see the X1 Fold, and now I&#39;m £2999 lighter!!!!!!

Just imagine this with  AMD. Please take my money.
I would buy it if it had amd. I dont want old cpu process.
...could you not have flashed universal units on screen rather than 1.99 pounds? I still don&#39;t know the weight of this laptop.
It&#39;s very nice and light weight
Oh! It&#39;s 1.99 pounds...so happy it&#39;s not 2.2 pounds. Would&#39;ve really killed my shoulders.

Good but flex nooo plz take it away
I think that the ThinkPad logo is outdated and the position in the laptop doesn&#39;t help either. Also the design of the keyboard looks old next to a MacBook
Someone else will joke about wallet?
Technology now in days is so crazy
Intel chips ruined it, if it didn&#39;t have Intel chips u could have even gotten 24hrs of battery life from Ryzen chips.
another laptop you can&#39;t buy now<br>so sick of reviews of things that will someday come out, by then there will be some other crap reviewed
tbh that&#39;s the best webcam I have seen in a windows laptop.
windows  alert sound  😡😡😡
Save it or I&#39;m gonna steal it 😜
Me after searching on google and its 1500$ <br>Heck am Out
yes guys unbox therapy is dying
nice video editing this time 😍
Seem like Lew is opening early Christmas present...haha
1.99 pounds = 0.9kg
What will be the price on i phone 12 series in India
that is a cutting board..
Wait Foxes are Orange
I really like how Lew is still excited about tech, even after this long and so many gadgets on hand.




I&#39;ve got a ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6, and although there&#39;s a lot that I really love about it, there are a  few things about it that soured it for me. I found that when using it on my lap or my desk pad the fan intake gets blocked and it ends up getting hot and loud, I really hate that they put that tiny air intake there. I also noticed that if you plug it into a 60w charger while using it, the top left of the keyboard gets uncomfortably hot because of the fast charging. Finally the USB C ports feel really mushy and weak, and a plastic bit even broke off the inside of one of the ports a couple of months after getting it. I ended up replacing it with a 12&quot; MacBook Pro which doesn&#39;t suffer from any of the issues above, but the keyboard isn&#39;t nearly as good and I don&#39;t think it looks or feels as good in the hand. They&#39;ve really got to fix that stupid vent position.
Gotta get the keyboard so I can live my life
Graphics has left the chat
I&#39;ve had a Dell XPS 13 for a year and a bit and I want to change and was looking at a Dell XPS 15 because I wanted a little more screen and power but I don&#39;t get why this Lenovo or the last one was your choice but never a Dell XPS 🤷 just wondering the thoughts behind the choices
It even looks light. Holy.
Lenovo still maintain their classic design
Now install Arch Linux ( Don&#39;t do Gentoo) on it.
😎
1.99 lbs = 0.90 kg

Why there a red button in middle of that laptop<br><br>I have those and idk why it there
No HDMI 😭 Could have been perfect but I lost too many dongles already and can’t live my meeting room life without a full sized HDMI port.
I dont feel right at home when it still looks like dump from the 90&#39;s (red scroller)

Ceo of never seeing a MacBook
I found Lew&#39;s new girlfriend!
Great job guys awesome laptop<br><br>Just wanted to let you know there is a circular rainbow effect on the main cam at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=15m51s">15:51</a> maybe you can change the lighting slightly
Woah

It&#39;s a lightop :)
I hope in this pandemic, those students who really need a laptop will be blessed with a new one
How does it stand against Dell XPS 13/15 with the latest processor?
Can you do as video on what you think is the best laptop for college students? I know there’s already a bunch of videos, but I’d like your opinion
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=4m03s">4:03</a> .. it&#39;s &quot;Trackpoint&quot; .. best thing ThinkPad made.
No USB-A on a ThinkPad is a non-starter.
Why are the buttons above the trackpad. How will that work out :/
Got to take a look at this.   If it had 32gb memory I be sold
Hey, big up from France, love you guys.<br>What would be a good light dock for the serie X laptops ? I&#39;m currently using a Lenovo dock that is a lot heavier than my X1 carbon, <br>I like it a lot but I&#39;d like a more &quot;on the go&quot; solution (need my Ethernet ant display ports)<br>+ what&#39;s up with this fckd up Fn key placement...? ^^
Im happy he ditched apple, and stood out from other YouTubers.
Need AMD
But can it run Hackintosch?
stop moving so much!!!!!
which laptop brand is most reliable??<br>like in terms of mobile brands i can totally rely on google/OnePlus.<br>please tell me same in terms of laptops ✌️thank you🙏
thunderbolt = pain
Lew I love ur videos but pls pls make ur videos short like 7 - 10 mins
What I was thinking you will do a drop test as well 😁😁
Cant see myself buying a laptop until they fix the issue with laptops basically working for 1 year maximum, then shit gets way too hot, and the fps in any kind of game just goes down the hill. been like that for years
Allredy imaging the thumbnail of iPhone 12 in front of disappointed face of lew
The design  is pretty good, but the ports selection is too limited.
The world is ending and this guy is getting a new light laptop
Don&#39;t people get bored of these lame wallet jokes?
What about XPS13 9300 ?<br>or the new one 9310 ? or even 9310 2 in 1 ?
My loving laptop. I am using ThinkPad x1 carbon 1st gen. It is working fine now I am watching this video on Thinkpad x1Carbon first gen. Superb durable laptop ever
Lenovo is so underrated. They have been dropping banger laptops for years now and no one seems to talk about them. Its really sad. Side note, the nub is called the track point.
You look like Zach Galifianakis !
Remember when the time that Dave2D spin his laptop just to prove the lightness of the laptop ?
The Quick Brown Fox....
Even if they weight 10 pounds, as long as they keep the Thinkpad keyboard, I am buying anyway
As a Latitude fan i approve this thinkpad.

Anyone else thinks thinkpads are hideous? Can&#39;t get behind all these tech youtubers praising them.
What watch is he rocking?
Think pad exists.<br>Lew: Best laptop ever!


that red thing on that laptop is. i don&#39;t like it.
How much is it weigh in kilo?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=1m39s">1:39</a> That expression when you&#39;re so excited is really priceless.
X1 user here. Sim Tray (sometimes with SD card slot) are the back. Usually next to the left hinge — if you looking at the laptop normally.
Anyone got the background song? God damn

I love watching people having the things i really need and want but cant have.
Why they didn&#39;t put left ctrl button at the corner?
L🤣L..That is the most aggrevating sound in world...very true..windows needs to do something about that notification crap.. but I have a feeling they don&#39;t care
I&#39;ll stay with my Zephyrus G14.
I want a most insanely affordable laptop video 😂

One day laptop will be as light as air ......one day 🤣

THAT&#39;S INSANE❗
I dunno. 13 inches is just too small.
Go METRIC<br>LEWWWWwwwwwww.....
I hate that i always associate ThinkPad with cheep laptop&#39;s, becouse my school only has those but they are from like 2004 or 2007😂 and they can&#39;t even run word without laggs
I have a Lenovo Ryzen laptop &amp; it&#39;s a great machine, thankfully, theirs no red nipple on the keyboard, it looks weird.
Is there anyone shopping a laptop with the TOP criteria being that it should be the thinnest? I mean. Sure, its good, but NO one we=hold call the new XPS thick or anything
Really cool ☺️☺️
Lew: Omg look at my brand new light laptop<br>Also lew when he sees a Thinkpad that has the same design since 1992: My brand new awesome laptop
&quot;the lastest generation of intel chips&quot; <br>Okay you ruined it.


The main problem is that Lenovo, which owns Thinkpad, tends to cancel orders without cause or reason.
This man is never gonna find his ideal laptop
MY GOD THEY MADE IT 0.0001 MM THINNER
Yess!! i actually guessed the sim card location XD
If you like think pad you must be loving  hp elite book doo try that...

Give me one of your laptop <br>lol
Now we are using Phones Charger to Charge Laptop
Nobody:<br><br>This whole comments section: LIGHTEST WALLET

Jezz... that&#39;s soo light weight 😍
What about Lew new watch?
why do you need such a light laptop tho?<br>only real reason i can think of is if you travel by air with just a backpack otherwise no need for such a light laptop
13inch LG gram lighter.
You guys choose what kind of laptop you want?
For those who are too lazy to search on Google, 1.99 pounds is 0.9 Kg ;)
Sounds fragile though.
What about LG Gram?
LG?
Did somebody make wireles charger foe laptop with a cooler, like 2 in 1?

the thinkpad logo is just way too big which makes it ugly
HOW can you get so excited about  a laptop, a thinkpad no less , that doesnt have even one USB A , or HDMI, or SD cad reader?  what can you use this thing for with just USB C and a head phone jack? if I need dongles to get access to USB A , card reader and HDMI, whats the point of beeing thin and light, if I will carry more stuff with me, this , right here is the ANTI X300, the anti kodachi.
Who else knew this video was coming?<br>🙋
Insanely light they said.<br>Me typing on an LG Gram: Aww, that&#39;s cute.


what’s really amazing is that we live in an era where you can charge a lap top with a phone charger, if you live in the windows 98 era you’ll understand.
i hate the editing
TB only is BS 😶, &quot;Did you get the adapter for the USB key ? ... Nop i don&#39;t wanna take some adapters with me, every day !&quot;. Next. 👍
Thinkpad 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Lew hired new editor?
tomorrow is the start of our school and i don&#39;t have a laptop :&lt;
it was already unboxed when you recorded the video :(
everyone who read abt ur wallet becoming ultralight multiple times like this comment
0.9 kg
Thicc boi
YouTube sent the notification 1 hour later and the sim must be ans esim
How many thinkpads have you looked at? Haha
During the entire video you have just talked about how light it is ......well viewers would like to know about the  performance numbers!!
I would like to see a laptop with keyboard that can separate








Man, this laptop weighs more than my potato


A 17-minute video that could be literally 7 minutes long.
Almost every laptop has carbon. Plastic is a carbon compound lew
Can you do a Back to School Laptop Guide??? please
Is it as light as the SHARP Dynabook Portégé X30L-G? They are marketing it as the lightest lap ever...
Hey, can you please just do those 10 min unboxings....these approx 20 min one&#39;s get too much to bear
The keyboard nipple killed all my liking towards it immediately

Wow, I see so many times you try to compliment the laptop but then it fails on you, you were about to say that even in that weight it doesnt flex and then BOOM it flexes.... Can you be honest once?
Insanely light laptop making my wallet feel light headed
Binod
FUN FACT : THIS VIDEO IS SPONSERED BY LENOVO.


















I guess i saw the sim card tray on it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m12s">5:12</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=6m23s">6:23</a>
Waiting on the Ryzen version and I still want my fucking ports!!
I would use a chromebook instead of getting a chinese company laptop




😂😂😂😂😂
I’d have to load Linux on it
GUys....... Tell me.  Macbook or this Thinkpad? Let me know in comment below.
Thanks for the upload, but not the biggest fan of the hectic, loud style of this particular production, including the intrusive music.
damn, my lenovo 720s weighs 1.1kg and its light enough for me, cant imagine 0.9kg
&quot;It&#39;s like a cutting board&quot;.<br>Hmmm, best compliment a laptop can get!








Love from Bangladesh
Pt : which is your fav exercise<br>Me : touching my feet with my hands<br>Pt: really good boi<br>Frnds: understandable <br><br>Bad Bois why that exercise is good say it
❤️ from India
You should buy an electric scale, so that we  Verify some of these weights!.
But who is going to buy it ? <br>¯\_(ツ)_/¯
its 0.9 kg
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=0m48s">0:48</a> 1.99lbs....plus taxes.
i hope they bring back the clementine color. my lenovo  yoga 11s is still going great after 7 years but it has shown signs of slowing.
etar production Stay koro , trade dao, and exclusive for me
I used to type on a mechanical keyboard before getting the Thinkpad, not anymore, I don&#39;t ;)
Hope there will be ryzen version as intel is trash now...
Thought you were lying. The air is 2.8 lbs. Fuck this is light. It&#39;s a half pound heavier than the galaxy s7+
The thing I hate the most about my thinkpad is Fn button on the far left, and Ctrl is to the right of Fn. Why would they do that? Just why?
i though this laptop will be 999 chf or something like that nope...its 2,541 chf......WTF???
Garbage...
i have the x1 carbon
Here is a request lew would you rewiew soundcore life note plz
It&#39;s soo light that you won&#39;t even feel your WALLET




























its 0.86 Kg ( 1.99 Pounds) or just a little below a kg weight . Just letting the rest of the world know.
kharap na
the laptop will get heavier over time when there’s more data stored in it.







[insert a joke about how broke you are]
Are they making these things so ugly on purpose?
Compare this with surface devices Lew .Get a whole new video🤘🏻👍
Is iterly a school laptop
try acer swift 5 it may be lighter
super light but still windows 😅
Can you give me laptop for my online classes? I don&#39;t have one. <br><br>I hope you notice this
You can not fix this laptop. Buy 10 items for the futur hardware failures
Asus also has a ultra light portable at 1.87 lbs. I think the ways these things are going after year they are going to lighter then feathers
The only beef I have with thinkpads is their logo being sooooo dated looking. If they got a really clean simple logo then 👌👌👌


So to use traditional USB we need a dongle now.
Lew : Talking in pound<br>Rest of the world : What is this unit.


Me looks at the thumbnail: oh its another laptop<br>Also me looking at the laptop: WHAT TH3 FU-
You keeps saying pounds, Lew you are literally Canadian, as a member of the rest of the world, please say it in kilos
Lew you yap a lot nowadays, this could have been a 6 minute video like back then.
egpu followup please please please
ya poor Lew will be ordering one of these with a 4800U....silly i7
But the price isn&#39;t
Its look like a 200$ Chromebook
1000th comment
I don&#39;t understand the taller is better than wider argument based on productivity. I&#39;d rather have the wider display, can see more of a spreadsheet and can fit two .pdf documents next to each and leave the zoom at nearly 100%. Change my mind.
for Cinema watch, work, game and commodiousness
the charger looks exactly like the one i have with my hp spectre x360
What&#39;s the difference between the MacBook and the iPhone Apple?
This feels like a paid review(unboxing)!!!!
Oh wow! Might be light as a Feather.
Am I missing something? The surface pro is 1.8lbs and you get full windows 10.
my god can you use metric so we can understand how much does it weight ?????
arekto boro Chaye
&#39;&#39;Even with the foam on it&#39;&#39;<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Seriously?
I think considering the screen size the LG Gram is lighter
Kg plz?
I miss the “cool gadgets under ...$”







Oh my ... This is it! No one wants a super heavyweight but lightweight 👍
I HATE Lenovo laptops, gosh. 2020 but they look from 1987. Wouldn&#39;t be able to use something so ugly.
thats my future lap
The sim may be behind the battery
dao
Thanks 👍
Check me out
The best laptop I have ever seen and also I am a big fan of the Lenovo Thinkpad. In my opinion, this one is completely the end of the competition.  This is the best one until Lenovo makes it better.
Sitting with my iPad Pro 10.5 THEE ultimate computer 😉
Okay, that&#39;s cool but who would buy a laptop just because it&#39;s light?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m31s">5:31</a> LINKO STARTO
Everything but intel.. it misses AMD

The visual effects are too much
Is he wearing an apple watch?!😱
Lenovo should rebrand their thinkpad logo

My New INSANELY Light Wallet...
Paper thin
Couldn’t use it. I’d be living in dongleville. My company uses too many proprietary connectors that still have usb a on the other side




Bye bye LG Gram....
What are you gonna do on this pc?
Brother, you&#39;ve got to get the Lenovo Thinkpad fold in the studio! Looks pretty interesting....
Hey lew why your videos are so long
I also like this laptop this is one of my favourite laptop
Please make short videos like before
Brand ambassador of thinkpad
This shouldn&#39;t have been 17 minutes......what is happening lew



What’s the price range for this laptop?
Intel?<br>lol
The stick! That beautiful IBM style red stick. I only just found out that Lenovo continued IBM&#39;s ThinkPad series. I really miss the IBM logo, but I&#39;m really happy to see that ThinkPad still exists.
Price?
Lew how is the Fitbit sense you have on your wrist?
oof plastic bullshit it will get schratched everywhere it will bend like paper..
There’s no USB port bruh
The keyboard.
Now would you push for the touchscreen or take the nano as is?
Meanwhile, my laptop weighs more in kilograms than this does in pounds.
Lew : this laptop is amazing<br>Me : I don&#39;t care! it&#39;s Chinese

Bro , ur the best gadget reviewer on YouTube ❤️
what is pound
My laptop weighs a ton if I try to lift it from corner, like lew did.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m43s">12:43</a><br>that&#39;s not a little bit<br>the whole laptop is a big   F L E X
Is it just me or that laptop doesn&#39;t look &quot;thicc&quot;
Your unboxing osm.😮😮<br>And you are osm .<br>LOVE from India.🇮🇳♥️♥️🇮🇳<br>Big fan you.
hey @unbox therapy in this video you talked about the mapping of the extra touch pad additional buttons can you give me a link of the same how to do that because the thought of it gives me orgasm but i was not able to find an option to do the same
I already see overheating issues
which watch r u wearing right now
There is an HDMI port in at the back? I saw something in the video.
Acer Swift 5 2020. Same light weight, better price, full size HDMI, good battery... why don&#39;t you try it?
This is amazingly slim and light
looks good
Not enough ports for me, at all. Plus, it is too tiny.. I can&#39;t live without a 15.6&quot; screen. Not to mention, I love my MaxQ RTX graphics; gotta have it. Nope, not for me.
Those who reading this comment may your parents live more than 💯 years with good health 💛💛💐❤️

My X1 Carbon: Doh! Please don&#39;t replace me! I am still running strong.....
U didn&#39;t do a review on  the magic keyboard tho
What smartwatch is he using?
e-sim supported device doesn&#39;t have sim tray.
My phone feels heavy looking at this
this excitement about the keyboard is not going to age well
i used the ipad pro for a year...then added the keyboard... i found it beefy and heavy...if it had a dual boot with macos then i&#39;d accept it cos i have best of both worlds BUT it&#39;s just pados which is for me is still a glorified iphone with some &quot;pro&quot; apps. I&#39;ve actually just go rid of it because i found it so frustrating to use - i&#39;d start something on it but have to finish it off on my imac... it&#39;s great for drawing but when it&#39;s pushing into the £1000+ bracket with the keyboard - it should be doing so much more... it feels outdated due to it&#39;s limitations<br><br>I&#39;m going back to a laptop for my portability.
Hi. You weren&#39;t allowed to talk about the specs?
Mam love from entire INDIA
its plastic not metal it can&#39;t be compared to MacBook Air the material is too cheap.


Does it pass the one hand open test?
I had a 2013 think pad and OMG they keyboard was just the best thing ever
Hey Lew , can you in the future videos transform the pounds and so on into european terms as well? Thank you
The boot sound is ridiculous. I like it simple
Insanely light laptop for heavy wallet.
Beast🔥🔥🔥
Specs?
Despite it being so great, a lot of people still base their decision based on the Logo at the back and how popular they would be if they got that Fruit Company product.
The real question I&#39;d like to have answered tho is if you can use the back of it as a cuttingboard too. Would significantly improve the multiusage of it. When we&#39;re at it, throw in a miligram weighing scale for measurement of anything cut on said laptop.. like, uhm, flour for example
Love the new style ❤️


Wow
E SIM
The sim tray is on the back of the computer between the hinges
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=4m01s">4:01</a> That&#39;s a <b>nipple</b> !!
Just pls don‘t try to throw it away bc it is so light 😂😂
0.903 kilos<br>No problem
I’ve had my ThinkPad T460s for 4 years and it still holds up amazingly well today. Lenovo makes some great stuff, the X1 Nano might be my next upgrade!



It even beats the LG Gram which is 2.2  for 13&quot; size. I have the 17&quot; which is unbeatable at 3 lbs . Best laptop I&#39;ve used.

Max 16gb ram, why
12.20 for the sim tray
Noice
How much is a pound?? What do you talk in centuries old measure when living in a modern metric system country pal???

Lenovo is my favourite laptop brand, I just love it. 👍
Hope one Day i will got this!
Looks cool dropping the plastic envelope. That in some way represent what we use to do. Maybe if u drop it on a recycle bin for plastics, in front of the camera; it may help a bit our planet, for the teaching of recycling. <br><br>Love ur vids.
Hey Lew! Damn I just noticed that you have kawhi size hands bro! Good video as always!
The Asus expertbook P1 is 30g heavier than it and it&#39;s also amazing it is a 14 inch laptop

The moment i seen that red Buttock in middle of the keyboard in thumbnail i  figured it out it&#39;s a Thinkpad😉
Slimy
Fun Fact :  The laptop is not the only thing which is light, your wallet will also be.
It&#39;s fine.. but Huawei Mate Book Pro is just 1 Kg and is a full Laptop.. might want to try that ..
I don&#39;t know but why people start hitting likes for Justin Y. because<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>I need some Likes</b>

I call it a nipple 😅 Wikipedia says: A pointing stick (nub or nipple) is a small joystick used as a pointing device typically mounted centrally in a computer keyboard.







Review GAMING PCS
Found the tray in the end. What a happy ending
Lenovo laptops and phones are shit as a Lenovo user
Hello
Wanna feel old?<br>720p is no longer considered hd.
I literally just got a dell XPS 13 for school and I was at starbucks getting everything setup walked to the counter to get a cup of coffee and the minute I took my eyes off my table to place my order a homeless lady had snatched my laptop and ghosted. I&#39;ve basically been going to school on my iphone lol but once I get some extra cash I&#39;m def getting this laptop.

My world of knowledge for laptops are not the best for you. But you have me thinking about grabbing one like this, to get back into the laptops.
Ok
The new way to make videos is kind of annoying,.. the color shifts and quick movements are annoying. Content itself as great as always tho!
I feel like he has dropped the laptop while flexing its thickness.<br><br>But trimmed that part.
I’m fine with my thin and light HP Envy x360 from last year...
what about the dell xps?
Why can&#39;t Lenovo put the ports on both sides? Does Lenovo think that people only want to plug things in on one side, and might not ever find it convenient to plug things in on either side?
I&#39;m not impressed. My HP Spectre X360 13aw0091nb is light and one off the most beautiful designs. And build with aluminium not plastic like this one. Also a touchscreen.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=3m40s">3:40</a> tbh every device needs that these days lol
x1 g7 or g8 is 2.4 lbs and has much better connectivity. My x1g7 is so light that I am not sure if I had put it into my bag (with a notebook sleeve)
sTOP trying so hard. you are no longer funny
Meh... Acer Swift 7 is lighter
Aaah, yes. Another gadget I can&#39;t afford 🙂

Your RGB lighting made it look like shit.! Childish effects
Matte display, a nice touch.
Where can this be bought
How much is the price of this ?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=5m30s">5:30</a> 11th gen isnt out yet....
How good is the 4K on that laptop?
now i finally can use laptop to wave and use it as fan during hot
<b>Me and this laptop are two parallel lines do not intersect.</b>
But is it as thin as my wallet
Lew, what about the dell xps line? Specifically the Dell xps 13
Haha <br>My laptop 10 times weight of this laptop<br>And ⅒th power of this laptop😂


Did he tell the price of laptop..if anybody hear...Tell me. Does 1.99 pound is its weight or price?😗






No 1 view
Yuck, like all windows laptops. Dell is, in my opinion, slightly acceptable. Otherwise, it&#39;s macs.
why the video is not in 4k??
Lenovo answering the &quot;ipad + keyboard&quot; challenge.
Crazy............................................
No one was ejected (tie)
Love the edit.
Like a LG Gram ????
The sim tray must be back of laptop near the hing
Sim Trays are on the back  for T and X
Ugh and it still has the fucking trackpoint that has no purpose besides leaving a dull spot on your display after a while and to keep the cavemen happy, who still haven&#39;t realized, that trackpads, especially windows precision ones have gotten really good. Ever tried to use that dumbass trackpoint? It&#39;s just SHIT!
Guys how are Lenovo laptops battery longevity?
I have a T490s and somehow the backlight keyboard and the Nub died. I hope it doesnt happen to you.
“The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog”<br><br>Did you know this sentence has all the English alphabets..!!

I have Lenovo ThinkPad T490 and this is the same league 👍😃<br>Regards from Europe from my channel Bro&#39;s 😄👍
Nah . I owned a few of X1 Carbon and Extreme <br><br>They are good but cannot tolerate any high cpu usage applications or even heat itself.
Option 1: Buy a lighter laptop<br>Option 2: Take Steroids<br><br>Hmmmmmmmmm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDgbKe-FS8k&amp;t=12m22s">12:22</a> sim card slot spotted
you shold try the mi notebook
Everytime somebody weighs in Pounds I have to say &#39; OK GOOGLE &#39;
Is it available with other color options?
I think now drop test and bend test should be featured in all unboxing of light laptops. We should know how these carbon tradeoff works on durability too😄😉
Won&#39;t find this on Linus&#39; channels.  Not sure why... But who cares when Lou has it on lockdown.
i jst cant take this laptop seruously with tht thumbstick and tht slanted thinkpad logo on palm rest and on the back.
Everything cant be perfect in a small laptop like that
<b>Man</b> I want that laptop!😉😌
Trackpoint everybody. &quot;Track point&quot;

You that you need to over the cheaper versions of Samsung phone this Channel has a lot of subscribers so maybe  people  do not have a lot of money  can  pay for a much cheaper phone go over more phones by Samsung bran like LG Motorola and many other brands.
Hi
Lit
I&#39;ve been waiting for this ^^<br>Btw, can you review the new 15&quot; Dell G7?<br>The entry level i5 model because it&#39;s a gaming laptop with an 80 something WHr battery. I&#39;d use it for 3d modeling and writing. Writers love battery life. Freedom encourages creativity.
the best thing is the 16 : 10 screen finally <br><br>but I do wish they had  some 15 and 17 inch options with taller screens<br><br>and also AMD

Just a constructive comment : the colored led lighting ruins the video imho. The colores are altered... Making it difficult for the viewer to get the correct color and shape of the product
Looks amazing
Dope

Hello
idk why but I can feel the weight of laptop when Lew is holding it 😂😅






I think the SIM card tray is at the back side of the laptop
I also want to live life.

lenovo is a trash company which produces product which always have 1 or 2 problems in it

Now that&#39;s a pad that can be used as an exam pad
That ThinkPad logo is annoying
Can you cut bread on that?
Where is sim tray though?

After watching this <br>Le Me* - MY NEW INSANELY LIGHT WEIGHT WALLET....
Can my light wallet buy it🥺

Lew: The lightest laptop.<br>Meanwhile me: The lightest wallet.

Whatever, I really don&#39;t like the ThinkPad Style. It looks so bad. They should either get rid of it or refresh their ThinkPad icon.

I couldn&#39;t be the only one who thought he would drop the laptop by accident
You are the best tech youtuber
I&#39;ll be definitely looking into next year&#39;s model for my university laptop, just gotta hope I can find a good price

I like thin and light laptops but the lack of durability is such a huge drawback. My hp envy convertible only lasted a year before the hinge broke of and the screen cracked. £400 pound repair for something that could possible be avoided if it a bit thicker

hey, can you install CPU-Z , go to the SPD tab and tell me what brand name and part number is the memory that comes with the laptop ? that program can tell the specific ram they installed from factory
Should i switch from<br>X1 yoga 4th i7-8565U to this e14 gen 2 amd ryzen 7?


yep we have same thing.<br>when I see that CPU and price (in Türkiye it was even more cheaper btw :D)<br>I was like what hell is this price real ?
Make sure you have both hand free with holding camera you will need 3 hands 😆 🤣
How is Thinkpad L14 gen 2 compared to this one?

Thank you for awesome review !  <br>one point about build quality , when carrie in my bag without sleeve bag, one of usb plate is bend even the material look solid

Can you please tell me if e14 and e15 both are aluminum or only e14 is aluminum

Nice review. Thanks! I just placed order for E14 Gen 3 (16gb, 512gb ssd), I plan to use external monitor, plan for casual use and ocassional data /coding..
Hi i am planning to buy this machine but with updated specs 5800u + 16 gb ram and also gen 3 (with Mil spec) . I am going to use it for data science projects /casual gaming. Is it enough for  that?

I am skeptical about buying this laptop because of its TN display panel,how is the display overall?should I buy it?


Hello @moggelishes, but it doesn&#39;t have backlit keyboard... how can we deal with that

Thanks for the review
Awesome  video thank you alot

Does it has automatic booting feature?
Anyone using Thinkpad E14 gen 3 ??
Which is better in terms of quality, this one (Thinkpad E14) or Lenovo Flex 5? Both with Ryzen 7, 16gb Ram and 512SSD

How is it holding up?

Which size Screwdriver it requires? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqa2PNF4TZo&amp;t=8m25s">8:25</a>
can i play valorant with this laptop?

Hey, awesome video, what would you choose for programming as a student, this or a 4800h Legion 5?





Great review man.<br>I have a doubt. Since it doesn&#39;t have thunderbolt  support, can i use a usb dock with the laptop for power delivery, and 2 external displays. I am planning on using a single cable for everything.<br>I appreciate your answer.

I&#39;m having the same model with R5 4500U.<br>Got 2 months ago.❤️
Im getting it

Hello, can you please tell what is sustained clock speed under 100% workload (for more than 5 min atleast)



How do you feel about the exact same specs (512GB SDD, 16GB RAM, AMD 4700U with 300 NIT Touchscreen) but on the Lenovo Thinkbook 14 AMD, vs on the Thinkpad?  Price of $662 + sales tax with extra 5% discount on top of current promo.

My work gave me this thing

Will it&#39;s processor be good after another 5 years?<br>And<br>Can it last 5 years first????<br>Pls do reply


Finally some good one 😊
HI i followed the link you sent me and I can only see a ryzen 5 version ,  is there another link to order the laptop you reviewed, or is it out of stock. Also there is the E15 version. If you could send me a link please thanks.


what an excellent and clear review, you will have more subs in no time. i’ll be buying this tonight, eased my mind a lot after comparing vs t14 and p14. this thing is perfect for what i need it for, at a steal of a price

I think 🤔 I&#39;m gonna go for the E15 Gen 2 without any OS installed. As I&#39;m gonna use Linux on it.

Your the first person to say thinkpad doesn’t have good trackpad

Hi, I would like to know if it still works well. I&#39;m thinking of getting this model. Here in Perú it costs $ 980. I want it for university and play some games. I will appreciate your answer.

Is the battery life good? and is it good for playing games like minecraft,roblox etc.

Can you please share about cooling fan noise?

The one I got here in India has TN display instead of IPS. No backlit keyboard. 16 GB RAM though.

How is the build quality?

Hi! should i use this lenovo or acer swift 3? ill be using for my college assignments and presentations and media consumption work mostly





great thanks, am gonna get this ! Any newer recommendations or is this one still good ?

Great review! I want to ask you for your opinion, what is better for student and little pfogfamming, this one, or yoga slim 7? Specs sre the same. Thanks in advance :)

Review should be like this 👍

bruh u talkin u need a laptop that&#39;ll last you 3 years man I am considering buying it for it to last at least 8 years



Hi! do you think is best to go full 24 gb ram or 16? i have the 8 gb model

Hi! I just noticed that your review is on a popular Russian website for picking up cheapest prices on different products (<a href="https://www.e-katalog.ru/LENOVO-THINKPAD-E14-GEN-2-AMD.htm)">https://www.e-katalog.ru/LENOVO-THINKPAD-E14-GEN-2-AMD.htm)</a><br>Just wanted to tell you, since in my opinion it&#39;s pretty cool :p

Ohh, I see a downgrade in the keyboard department from E480 that I own: in E480, you just pop out left and right touchpad buttons, unscrew two bolts that are hidden under these and pop out the keyboard, place a new one in and that&#39;s it - and I had to replace it like that when it got damaged very easily when I wanted to clean it with a damp (maybe slightly too damp) cloth; fortunately I got a new one mailed in from Lenovo authorized service for free, no questions asked. Here I see the keyboard protrudes from below of the top cover, so replacing it would probably be a total pain.

how is the cooling in the laptop

When I watch movies, the LED around the power key makes me very <a href="http://uncomfortable.how/">uncomfortable.How</a> do I turn off the light around the Power button?


Bought this laptop last month. Within 2 weeks the screen started to bend / warp. Probably because the lid couldn&#39;t handle the screen heat. Now back to Lenovo for repair.



How is the ryzen 5 4500u for video editing?



I just don´t understand and don´t like. So I will have USB-C and that is the only port to power delivering. So can I connect 2 displays via HDMI and USB-C. How can I charge that during that? Can I charge it and use it as displayport at the same time? Via some Hub or somethink like that? I am so confused from Usb-C ... gen 1, gen 2, gen 2x2, thunderbold, it does support power delivery, it does not support... etc. Please help me. I like this notebook but need to connect it with 2 displays.

Hello everyone!!! Does this laptop support thunderbolt 3?
Does it have a backlit keyboard?

Which is better for work... This E14 or the Thinkbook 15 G2 ARE in ryzen 7 4800u?

intel core i3 with a premium price
Can we install Kingston A2000 M.2 NVME SSD in extra Slot ?


Hi, I would like to know if you have any experience with the TN FHD panel on the entry level ThinkPad g2.? Is it so much worse than the IPS?






What ssd does it support




Do we have extra Ram and storage slot in 4500u model as well of same E14 gen2 series ?

Hi does the graphics card of this laptop support games like fortnite

You can go for 16GB of dual-channel, or 24GB of a single channel. Pick one of those because 8GB are soldered.


I am confused between 4500U 8/256 model @ 400€.  <br><br>and a Lenovo IdeaPadGaming 4600H with GTX1650Ti  @730€<br>Usage: Matlab/Python - For ML -lots of Image processing . <br><br>I can maybe add an eGPU from 2nd Nvme (PciE slot) of ThinkPad

Hi, I would like to know  how the battery  life has been for you, I normally do a mix of web browsing, bit of excel, word, and consuming content like YouTube . 🤔, but don&#39;t play any games nor use heavy programs. By the way Great review 👍🙂



thinkpads look cool but 300 bucks extra for a nice aluminium body is a bit too much

Does it charge through Usb C? How much does the battery last with low tasks such as web browsing?<br>Thanks for the vid!

Hello, Good Review..<br><br>I&#39;ve a question regarding that...<br><br>Can Powerbank charge this laptop by type C to type C?<br><br>If yes, which one will support it?<br>22.5W or 30W or 45W

Hello, Good Review..<br><br>I&#39;ve a question regarding that...<br><br>Can Powerbank charge this laptop by type C to type C?<br><br>If yes, which one will support it?<br>22.5W or 30W or 45W

Thanks for making useful review.

Great review 👍 yours is the only detailed review that was available. For some reason this laptop is not generating as much as attention as I believe it should, considering the specs on this machine. I just ordered mine and should have it in the coming week.


E14 or hp envy<br><br>(Build (chassis, hinges, associated internal parts, <br>and durability?

Great review. Much appreciated!

Can ram be upgraded?<br>How many memory slots?



Is this available in india. If pls give link for me.  Cuz I want to buy this version.

Is it ok for 1080p video editing? And editing photos in Lightroom

best review video in my life

Good review bruh!

Great review, <br>I am living in the middle east &quot;Saudi&quot; I pre ordered mine online from B&amp;H  13 days ago and still under coming soon status :(.


Good review bro.If I hadn&#39;t seen this computer I can almost have paid $375 more to another laptop.I ordered this.I guess it will come 1 or 2 days. My only concern when I buying was the quality of the video card.I hope it&#39;s good quality, I don&#39;t know much about amd&#39;s graphics card.I liked all the other features.I&#39;m Electronics and Communication Engineering Students and I believe this laptop will be a good choice for me.<br><br>Thank you for the review.<br>Greetings from Turkey🇹🇷😊👌🏻





I have a question.<br>Does It have Vega 7 or Vega 10 Graphics

Hi, brother <br>Will it work with Linux? I mean with same efficiency?

good review all added bro take care
great review!<br>ı would like to know that this laptop suitable for engineering? <br>I don&#39;t play games just for education

Hi, what about fan noise?



Hi there could this laptop run games like minecraft? Could it run fortnite?


Great review bro!! My only question is, can I use this laptop for my audio and video editing ?? I&#39;m a voiceover artist and a content creator so editing on cubase or premier pro is crucial for me .....

Have you faced any touchpad issues when the laptop is in hands ?



What about the fan? My old laptop can handle all my daily task easy. I work as a writer so I need a good keyboard. Sometimes when the kids are asleep I play some good old world of warcraft classic and the fans start acting like I was playing the newest top gen game on the highest settings. It’s annoying. I think you can compare league to wow classic because both dont require much. Did the fans pump up?



Did I hear backlit keypad?

Great review!!<br>I have a question about the keyboard. Is it a backlit keyboard or is it like the L480 that isn&#39;t backlit?<br><br>I&#39;m a ThinkPad &quot;noob&quot; so forgive me if this question is unnecessary



Good days my friend. The Ryzen 7 4700u has a 15w and a 25w model. Which model is used in this laptop?

What about video editing on this machine?

how is fan noise ?

@moggelishes I know this laptops come with onboard soldered ram how ever I would like to know its latency(CL). you can run cpuz to find the RAM latency.

Can I add more ram to it?

Can I upgrade ram ??upto how much GB??



Nice review!<br><br>And about the other thinkpad versions, you get the T series for durability (has rollcage and better hinges and materials) and better screen options, plus, T series doesn&#39;t have Soldered RAM, thus allowing you to go up to 32GB, which would be perfect for somebody who needs to run virtual machines or high-consuming RAM applications in general.






Backlit keyboard or not?

Ordered on 8 sept,<br>Now no status changed till now

Really nice review, i will buy one for my computer science study

Please tell me, is the soldered RAM working in dual channel without the slot being used, like the latest ideapad laptops do? Wondering whether  a 8gb version of e15 g2 will work like that, or should I order another 8gb module as well



This doesn&#39;t have ssd ? Can i add



Can we get more display details like ntsc percent and screen to body ratio?

I wanna have fedora 32 workstation on it. Is it compatible?

Can I use it for intense programming?

hey did you get os preinstalled or did you install it yourself

Excellent review and the first one I believe. I have ordered the E14 barebones version with aluminum bottom



Does it have a whitelist ?

So many ThinkPads.  X is the most compact, so I get that.  T is their Top series, okay.  P is their portable workstation stuff.<br>Then there&#39;s L and E.  E sounds like Economy class.  It&#39;s still ThinkPad, but it&#39;s at the bottom of the class.  L is in between T and E.<br>I&#39;m not sure if both L and E need to exist.  And then, they have the 2-in-1 (tablet convertible) stuff.







Any screen bleeding problems??

How much is it as in the lenovo uk it hasnt got the gen 2 model yet so I dunno what&#39;s the price

Wow thanks for this detailed review! I was originally planning to buy a different laptop but it got sold out so I&#39;m looking for other options. Might consider this one.









Does it have a backlit keyboard??





I have heard the build quality of E series has improved a lot but still how does it fair against a T14 in terms of ruggedness and material quality?



Awesome review man!! Thanks for making the time and effort to create this (Your the only one who did 😄)<br><br>Going to get mine the ryzen 5 4500u version in Australia on Wednesday. Ordered it tonight but wished it came now after seeing your review 😂😂<br><br>Just a question for you, all my other laptops had an incredible amount of fan noise whilst doing simple tasks like Web browsing and YouTube videos (Acer and HP 🤦🏻‍♂️). How&#39;s the fan noise on the e14 gen 2?



no sd card :(

hi guys. does anyone have the e15 i7 und RX640.. how is it working ? strong enough in general and for GIS and 3D Modelling ? and how is the cooling? as I heard there are problems ?  thank you



i think i like

Benchmark on ssd?



I ordered but taking 8 week time,<br>Do not know when it will arrive ,,, really a long time








bought my e14 gen 2 a few days ago, it came within 2 days! I love this computer. All for $1060Nzd





What about the battery backup on this E14 R7



Was Searching and waiting for it... Even Google doesn&#39;t give results for ThinkPad E14 Ryzen 7 India Search... Nice Stuff Bro...

I am sorry for all of you touchpad lovers. You have no idea about efficiency and productivity because you ignore Track Point - much better and more productive device versus touchpad.<br>I use ThinkPads for many years and Trackpoint is one of the reasons I stick to these laptops.






Great review! <br>Also I would like to ask what parts are made from aluminum and what are made from plastic?







Can I play gta V occasionally


Bro is the brightness enough to use in classroom at college ?

No other creator has reviewed this laptop...!! Thanks man!! Really helpful! I&#39;m getting it around 60k in India 🍻


























Nice review! But you forgot to mention the fingerprint scanner is already integrated with the switch off button.

I&#39;m in love with this little things man ! best 800 euros  of my life






















Will this laptop be suitable for a bioinformatics student?


Is this compatible for an external graphics card..?

I&#39;m a satisfied E14 owner. I ordered it directly from Lenovo with Ryzen 4700U, 24 GB RAM &amp; 1,5 TB SSD. It works flawlessly with the ThinkPad USB-C Gen 2 Dockingstation.  5.941 Multi-Core Score  points @ Geekbench 5.2.









is there a second slot for ram? also is the keyboard backlit?




Hi, your thoughts on the e15 gen 2 with the ryzen 7?


I ordered this version. Waiting for delivery.

















I will get the e15 next month.<br>nice review, thank you and well done


i got the e15 gen2 its amazing





Bought mine a week ago. No regrets.




Nice review...

A very good review mate, well done, keep that up!!

Good Video man!

Still waiting for IPS panel, here it is available in WVA (











im so jealous, i have the gen 1 thinkpad e15 i wish i had waited. :( <br><br>1-includes an additional heat pipe<br>2-support dual ram channel<br>3-extra m.2 slot<br>4-and has a way better cpu (ryzen)






Tha ks for the review, great specs for the price

first &lt;3
I probably wouldn&#39;t since the pros aren&#39;t worth the price over what you already have.
@Moggelishes thank you



They are quite similar. The E14 is a bit cheaper but doesn&#39;t have the same ports, doesn&#39;t come with touchscreen and can&#39;t have as much computing power. But an E14 and L14 with similar specs are incredibly closely matched. If I&#39;m not mistaken the L14 is slightly bigger too.

Mine has held up very well!

They come both as plastic and aluminium. Check your specific market to see which material yours is.


For sure. It is great for such tasks!

The display itself isn&#39;t bad but its peak brightness is very low. Working in direct sunlight isn&#39;t good.
@Moggelishes oh okay👍

Mine does. It doesn&#39;t come on all E14 gen 2 models, you have to check your specific market for that.


Appreciate it 🙏



This has better overall qualify<br> The hinges and the construction is made for school/corporate whereas the flex 5 is built to be a 2 in one and therefore isn&#39;t as solid. But it is still well put together ☺️

Really Good! Im using it on a daily basis, playing games and using it for school. Still like it was new tbh ☺️


If you drop the quality way down yes 😉

My brother bought this laptop for his studies where he does about 80% programming on Linux and it has been really great. The legion has more graphics power but for most programmers a graphics card is not that useful. I&#39;d really recommend this to be honest ☺️
@Moggelishes Yes, I really don&#39;t care about gaming, the only aspects that bother me is that the Legion 5 has a larger screen + better one of the best cooling systems and the 4800h is a killer processor. That was a quick reply!
​@Moggelishes I will notice this one, thanks so much
Honestly, all gaming laptops are good value. But the build quality and look usually falls into the meh category and that&#39;s where you get the industrial design of the ThinkPad which some really prefer :)
@Moggelishes Awesome, thank you!

I strongly doubt that it will work .. the USBC port is just for charging on this model. I don&#39;t know about the Intel models but they might have thunderbolt... But thanks for the kind words and your questions :)


Good for you ☺️

It holds steady at 4Ghz on all cores/threads under heavy load for 5+ minutes. The CPU is truly amazing 🙌
@Moggelishes thanks, i was thinking to go for gaming laptop (4600h) , but now i will stick to this only. I never play games though.
@MD Zaid If you don&#39;t game, this will do everything 🙌

The thinkbook is a bit more personal style where as the ThinkPad is more corporate style. The ThinkPad is sturdier and has a bit more industrial build made for school/workplaces. Both are brilliant machines. And if you need a touchscreen, the choice becomes obvious :)

Lucky you ☺️

Like all computers, it will get slower with time. But if you don&#39;t max out the storage and maybe install more than 8gb of ram this machine will last you a very long time!
@Moggelishes okay bro thq


Then you might not be able to order the model with the ryzen 7 in your country. They also change which models are available often, I&#39;d be on the lookout If I were you.
@Moggelishes thanks

Hey I appreciate it! I made it just because there wasn&#39;t enough information about the model on the internet at the time of buying it. Appreciate your kind words, and enjoy yours!

A very good choice! Beware that the battery is smaller on that model (yes even though it is larger).

What I meant was this isn&#39;t as good as other thinkpad track pads :)

For you it&#39;s perfect. Everything is still running smooth and build quality is still great!

Battery life is quite good. Gets me through a 7h day at school with a full charge. Minecraft and roblox will run very well too!

They are only audible after 1h+ of gaming. Never during school work.

That is a fair trade. All models have their ups and downs :)

The build quality varies depending on if you have the aluminum or plastic option. Either way, it is not as solid as a lenovo T-series but I&#39;ve had mine for a good while and it has been great in terms of build quality!

and whats the main differences with e15 and l13?
The acer swift doesnt offer the same build quality as the ThinkPad and since you are using it at school like me, the ThinkPad will be a better option. The acer often offers better price/performance tho. My E14 is brilliant for everything you described above. And the keyboard is WAY better on the ThinkPad, and that is a big deal while writing essays and such.
E15 has a bigger screen and has a keypad. It has a SMALLER battery tho. Those are the main differences. The L series is more for business and E series is more focused on personal/school use.
@Moggelishes wow thanks so much for the easy explanation! u deserve more recognition :)
Haha thank you! I try my best to explain in very plain English so that someone with little knowledge would understand. (I&#39;m not saying you have little knowledge hihi). I&#39;m just not sure what content I would keep putting up... I made this video only because I couldn&#39;t find the information I wanted about it before purchasing :)

This is still the very newst generation and i can strongly recommend it!

I would go with the Thinkpad for build quality and probably better ports and cooling. The slim 7 has a touchscreen if i remember correctly which ca be nice for taking notes. I would go E14 gen 2 personally but either one will work wonders for you!

Thank you. My first try!

Yeah but of course I&#39;d like it to last longer. I&#39;ve had it for a long while and it isn&#39;t showing age what so ever. With the ryzen 7 this guy will hold on!
@Moggelishes Yeah, the Ryzen 4000 series is super powerful for a laptop, the models with them definitely will last longer than these Comet Lake models (which also are more expensive). But I think I will be going with the Ryzen 5 4500U 8/256 model because I found it for an amazing price and always I can add more RAM or a second SSD
Either 4000 series processor will hold up better in the long run for sure!

16 should be enough for most work on a laptop of this calibre :)

Dang, thats kinda epic :O

Good catch!

Decent. Not great not bad. It gets warm but never to the point where it burns your lap.

Probably in the Lenovo Vantage software or perhaps in BIOS
@Moggelishes thank you for answering.I didn’t find in BIOS :(

I haven&#39;t had any issues and ice had it for almost half a year. I&#39;ve done some hard gaming on it and it has gotten quite hot. No problems :)
@Moggelishes Do you use an external screen for gaming and have the lid closed? That way the heat of the CPU and GPU (exiting at the back right of the E14) isn&#39;t hitting the bottom of the lid.
I was using only the laptop. Only external device was a mouse.

Very good. But I&#39;d go for the ryzen 7 for that and extra longevity. It&#39;s not much more expensive.
@Moggelishes thanks! I am looking to buy this model in India. The indian model ditches backlit and the windows 10 pro. Instead it uses windows 10 home and student edition with MS office pre installed. <br><br>Will the quality and performance be good for beginners video editing fir the coming 5 years?
For sure it will be! Tho you might wanna look at a laptop that has a dedicated GPU too.

You wont be able to run a monitor off the USB-C sadly...


Some models do. Mine does for example. Check your specific website to get such information :)

This :)


Yep.
@Moggelishes thank you so much

I don&#39;t have any experience but I&#39;d say you should avoid ALL TN panels everywhere really...
@Moggelishes oh, 😕. In my country there is only the TN panel option 🙁
It obviously depends on what you expect of the screen. What will you use it for?
@Moggelishes basically, watching YouTube, web browsing, word, excel and other stuff
Okay. Then you will be fine with a TN panel. It won&#39;t be bright. The colors won&#39;t be the best. But for your use case it&#39;s enough. Just enough 👍
@Moggelishes yeah, its such a pity . Thanks for the answer 👍

2280 M.2
@Moggelishes Nvme or sata
@Moggelishes or both
It definitely supports Nvme so then I suppose SATA will work too

Yep! If the model already has more than 8gb RAM the slot will be used. But if it has the same specs with the CPU being the only difference it will be the same as this!

On lower settings, Yes. But this isn&#39;t a gaming laptop.

24GB will be single channel? I dont understand. It has dual slot, so that doesnt mean it will be dual channel even with 8+16 gb RAM?
@Govind Raj 8-8 will be dual channel, with the other 8 will be single channel.

You can add an eGPU from the free 2280 M.2 slot. I would explore that possibility but the IdeaPad doesn&#39;t seem bad either!

Thank you for watching and commenting! With your kind of usage I&#39;d say you can get around 10 hours out of it 👍
@Moggelishes oh, that&#39;s pretty amazing 🙂. Sadly this version isn&#39;t still available in my country (Chile 🇨🇱), only the base model, but it has ryzen 3, TN panel, no Backlit keyboard and only 4 gb of ram. So I will keep waiting. Thanks for answering 👍🙂
Yes, I&#39;d say waiting is the right call. Hope you get it soon 😀

The plastic is very nice quality too tho👍

Watch the video and you will find out😏 It does charge via usb-c and it will last you probably 10+ hours

I am not sure which one will actually charge it. But it will charge via usb-c to usb-c. The standard charger is 65W. I could try to charge it with one with less W tho

65W

No problemo 😊

Exactly why i made the review. I&#39;ve never made a video before. But I felt like this product needed one since I couldn&#39;t find all the info I wanted before purchasing it myself.
Could you send me the link to order this laptop thanks

ThinkPad for build and keyboard. Envy for screen. You can get both with same specs.

Thank you! Much appreciate you too!

RAM can be upgraded. There is one memory slot available.
Thanks <br>1 is soldered/fixed<br>Plus empty mem slot
@ric vb Correct!

Many others in the comments are Indian. It is available but delivery seems to be very long.

I&#39;d say you should get a laptop with a dedicated GPU and a better, more color accurate screen. But it will do it. Just won&#39;t be the best out there.

There&#39;s no way that&#39;s true. But thank you so very much anyway 🤪

Thank you!

Thank you! These are in high demand so I&#39;m not that surprised that shipping could be longer than usual...
Hoq much did you get it for?

Where did you order it from ?
Berk beğendin mi laptopu?
Evet gayet beğendim.Sadece beğenmediklerimi ya da eksik yönlerini söyleyeyim geri kalan her şey çok iyi bence.Ekran kartından çok çok yüksek beklentin yoksa yani mimar değilsen ya da fazla büyük oyunlar oynamıyorsan alınır.Touchpad ini,ses kalitesini biraz beğenmedim sanki önceki kullandığım Asus unki daha iyiydi sanki.Bir de işine göre değişir ama dahili ekran kartı ram den yediği için ram i 16gb a yükseltmek iyi olur.
Berk Yvz anladım çok teşekkür ederim
@Mustafa Orcun Deniz rica ederim

Vega 7. So it runs on a 7nm chip which makes it very efficient.

It has really good Linux support as long as you upgrade to a version above 5.4 on the core. But things like the fingerprint reader doesn&#39;t have drivers for linux (goodfix)


Yes it very much is. Keyboard, battery and build quality as well as performance is great.

It doesn&#39;t get very loud even under load. It&#39;s audible, but not annoying. Definably library compatible.
thanks for answering &lt;3
@Yeşil Medya No problem. Sorry for being so slow to respond. Somehow I missed your comment😔

Yep, it could.
@Moggelishes ok thanks a lot :)

You CAN use this laptop for such tasks. Although the screen doesn&#39;t get very bright and is not that color accurate which could play a bit part in video editing.<br><br>But the CPU is more than capable of both audio and video editing. I&#39;d consider some other laptops with better screens for your specific needs. But you can go with this if you feel you find nothing else that is better.

What do you mean by &quot;when it&#39;s in hands&quot;.
@Moggelishes Like when you are holding with your one hand and hovering the touchpad from another in the air not on table
Haven&#39;t faced such issues, yet :)

Short answer: This laptop is perfect for you. <br><br>Longer answer: The keyboard is excellent and should keep up even with a professional writer. I play games regularly on this machine and I have only heard it spin up the fan after hours of more demanding games. League doesn&#39;t make it sweat.
@Moggelishes i bought it. The keyboard is great! Display okay as well. No 4K stuff but I don‘t need that anyway. The performance is amazing as well. Love that amd chip. Good video. It made me try out the product. You should get some lenovo sponsoring ;)
Hahah, Maybe some day they will hit me up. But for now I&#39;ll just try to help you guys out!

Backlit keyboard :)

Thank you for the compliment! And that is not a bad question. The answer is that you CAN get a backlit keyboard. But it doesn&#39;t come on all models. So be sure to look for &quot;backlit keyboard&quot;
Thanks for the info, I&#39;ll look at this when I buy.<br><br>Cheers!
Thank you for watching!

?

The screen isn&#39;t the most color accurate display out there... But the CPU can definitely handle it!

This laptop remains very quiet even under load. I haven&#39;t been annoyed by it whatsoever.

CAS# Latency is 22.0 docks.

Yes. You can add 16 gigs on you own if you have the 8 gig model.

Yes, you can upgrade RAM. Up to 24 gigs (8+16)
@Moggelishes can I add HDD?? But the ram is solderd dose it has an empty slot to add
@Nikhil Gb 8 Gigs are Solderd. Then you have an empty slot for up to 16 gigs more. There is also a M.2 slot (2280) available.

I&#39;d say 24 gigs is plenty for almost all users. But yes, the MIL-SPEC is useful for companies and some of the IO is better for corporate use. But E series is way better value for students :)
@Moggelishes I don&#39;t get how it is just 24gb ram? How did you come up with that?
@Lukas 8GB is Solderd. Then you can add up to 16 which makes 24 in total...
@Moggelishes Can&#39;t you add 32gb? + 8 soldered = 40 gb
@Lukas If i remember correctly the website said up to 24. You might be right tho :)
It isn&#39;t true t may have soldered ram

It is backlit. But it is optional so make sure you read your specific spec.

Ouch... They are very popular indeed.

Thank you very much! It should be quite perfect for your studies.

I would probably order another 8gig module since 8 is a bit on the low side. But I can check when I get home later today.
Nevermind, I think I&#39;d better get the 16gig version ;)
Yes. That&#39;s the way to go👍

This has an M.2 SSD installed and if you want to add more storage there is an empty M.2 (2280) slot available.
@Moggelishes what about ssd speeds?
The preinstalled one is a 2242 M.2 meaning it isn&#39;t very quick. But if you install a 2280 on you own in the free slot you can get much higher Speeds.

It covers only 45% of sRGB... So don&#39;t buy this for photo or and video editing. The screen to body ratio is 92% But only the bottom bezel is thicker. Otherwise they are all around very thin! A good design.

Isn&#39;t fedora compatible with all Linux, Windows and MacOS laptops and desktops?

Yes. My brother has the same model and all he does is programm. He loves it!

I got mine preinstalled. Like I said in the video. That was the very first time I launched the laptop. I had windows 10 Pro preinstalled with basically no bloatware.

Thank you very much! That&#39;s the reason I made it :)
@Moggelishes I am a systems administrator and mostly administer the T series laptops at work which are truly enterprise class machines (MIL-SPECS tested) but also pricey for personal use. The E14 inherits almost everything from the T series in terms of hardware except the dual USB Type C ports (ThunderBolt), display nits of 300 and a 3-year onsite warranty. But at half the price, Lenevo has rolled out a true winner.
Precisely my opinion. The E is Everything you want for personal use and school. Only if work at an office at a big company then the T could be worth it. But you have to pay almost double for the same specs...

I can&#39;t say for sure. But I would guess that it has one...

Considering how good the E series is I think it should exist. Best price/performance Model...
@Moggelishes Sure, I&#39;m not saying E-series is bad or anything.  Either L-series or E-series can disappear, and I don&#39;t think we&#39;d miss anything.  Too many layers.
That&#39;s true. At this point deciding on which one is to get is just confusing...
For me it was an E14 or an X1... I went with the E because of the specs. Haven’t regretted it
@roberto armstrong Exactly my point. You get similar power for half price. X1 world be for screen and build.
Moggelishes build on the E14 is still premium, it’s not subpar at all imho... the matte screen is fine too. The only subpar thing on it is the camera but I don’t use it that much 🤷🏼‍♀️
@roberto armstrong Totally agree. But then again, no laptop has a decent camera anyway 🤷‍♂️

Not that I&#39;ve noticed! Only issue with display is that in some conditions it doesn&#39;t get bright enough...

It&#39;s in the video... But I bought it for 8000 SEK (with student discount and tax included) which would be ~700£

I appreciate that! What other laptops were you looking at? I was also looking elsewhere.
@Moggelishes  I&#39;m planning on getting the Huawei Matebook D14 Ryzen 5 4500u 16gb RAM, 512gb SSD. I&#39;m comparing it against the R5 version of the E14 and I&#39;m honestly confused on what to get. They&#39;re pretty much the same and I think E14 has better specs overall but, I also prefer D14&#39;s lighter weight and its all-aluminum chassis because I&#39;m not so fond of the plastic bottom and red accents. I know it sounds stupid to pick aesthetics over a bit of performance, but what do you think? And do you have any other suggestions at this price point? 😅
I was looking so much at the D14. Honestly, I WANTED that one instead. But that was only available with ryzen 3000 series at the time... So I just couldn&#39;t then. If you can get it now with a 4000 series processor, then go for the one you LIKE the most. Keyboard is better on E14 tho, keep that in mind :)
@Moggelishes Can I ask you one more thing? Which one has better display, the D14 or E14? I hear they both have up to 250 nits display but I can&#39;t seem to find a proper comparison between the two and I haven&#39;t seen either one up close so I couldn&#39;t really tell.
@Gwen Milvar I went and saw the D14 in store before I got the D14 and it looked slightly better. No big difference tho. One thing could be, if you can get the D14 with a glossy screen, then that&#39;s a difference.
@Moggelishes Oh okay, I&#39;ll definitely keep these things in mind. Thank you so so much for taking the time to respond! I&#39;m subbing because you&#39;re awesome! I hope your channel will grow in the future. :)
Thank you man! Truly means a lot. I&#39;m trying to figure out what videos I could do in the future. Tips are appreciated 😁
@Moggelishes Woops, I&#39;m a girl btw! hahaha but it&#39;s alright. <br>I suggest you make a &quot;long term&quot; review on the E14 for starters. It would help a lot of us who are planning to use it for a couple of years or more. Maybe you could also make comparison videos between different models or even suggestion videos of budget-friendly laptops with specs along the lines of the E14 (like the Lenovo Xiaoxin 13 Pro, I barely see any decent review about this). Hope this could somehow give you an idea. Good luck! :)
@Gwen Milvar Omg, I&#39;m so sorry🤦But thank you so very much still. Appreciate the support sooo much😋

Yes it does. Watch the video and you would&#39;ve known 😉
@Moggelishes oh I didn&#39;t notice that.<br>Can you also tell me if the red dot on the ThinkPad logo on the lid lights up.??
Yes it very much does!
@Moggelishes thanks for informing. I am not sure if these features are also available in the Indian market.
@Nilutpol Borah yes I doubt that

I have no past experience with Thinkpad E Series but all I can say is that there is nothing to complain about in terms of ruggedness. The aluminum top gives it a premium feel and paired with a good hinge this screen doesn&#39;t wobble or shake at all. The bottom is a high quality plastic that feels good, it&#39;s not like an aluminum laptop, but damn close. The only small things I&#39;ve found are that the USB-C port doesn&#39;t feel 100% satisfying and the cable can wiggle a tiny bit. TLDR; It&#39;s definitely solid enough and I see no reason to get the T series over this.
@Moggelishes I can agree to your statement. For me, there was no need to pay the extra 500 € for a T14 with a 400 nits display as I use my E14 mainly with an external monitor.
I feel like I should clarify. The bottom that rests on your lap is also aluminum. The entire Outside is Aluminum. But the part around the keyboard is a very high quality plastic. This gives good rigidity and feel.

Thank you so much for writing! There is a very slight hum under full load, but I have never heard the fans during regular use. I hope you will enjoy yours!
So you commented before 11 months, i am assuming that you have used the machine thoroughly by now. I just want to know, how&#39;s the battery life?
If you are asking me, it is great. It gets me through any day of school (up to 7.5 hrs) under medium load without issues. You can watch media for that long too.

adaptors tho

I have the E14 with these specs and it’s great. Fast and reliable. Running SsD drive w/ 16g Ram
Nice!
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23roberto">#roberto</a> armstrong... how do you come along with this product, I also think about buying this for work.. GIS and a bit 3D modelling. The only thing I worry about is the display and the heat/fan... does it really get hot?  and how good is the rx640? thank you sir

🤔🤔🤔I think so too🤔🤔🤔

I have not performed a benchmark but since it is a small m.2 I&#39;m guessing around 500mbit/s read and write. If you choose to install a second one (2280) it can be much faster.
@Moggelishes can&#39;t wait to add an xpg 8200 pro
Sound good! I&#39;m considering adding a fast m.2 as well!

Wow! And Lenovo hasn&#39;t told you anything?
Does it have a backlit keyboard??
Yes. It only comes on some models. So check your specific market so you don&#39;t get mistaken.
does it have a backlit keyboard? Let us know when you get yours.
@Vivek Gopal Mine has it...
@Moggelishes where did you buy it from? I am from India and <a href="http://lenovo.com/in/en">lenovo.com/in/en</a> is the only online retails store that has the E14 gen2 amd variant however it doesn&#39;t have a customizable option for keyboards which is really confusing.
@Vivek Gopal amd version has no backlit keyboard in india
Thank you for clarifying :)

Sounds very similar to my experience. Thank you for sharing!
Bro battery back up
It has 45Wh cell that can give up to 10.7h (MM18) and it charges from 0-80% in 60 minutes.
Where did you order it from?
@global warming is real Lenovo

I don&#39;t actually know anything about this, can&#39;t find any info...
Non-removable lithium-polymer battery offers max up to 13 hours* 45Wh (MobileMark14)<br>and up to to 10.7 hours* (MM18).<br>You can expect 5~6 hours of continuous video watching at high volume.<br>Also supports Rapid Charge (0-80% in 60 minutes)
Thanks for the information...

Wow. This laptop is rare!

I&#39;ve long been curious as to if it could be more effective. Also since this touchpad isn&#39;t the best one out there. Thank you for sharing!
@Moggelishes why Trackpoint is better for productivity? It is simple - your hands are always on the keyboard on the right position. All basic functions are there: pointing, clicks, scroll (including zoom in/out if application supports this). Scrolling works via middle button + Trackpoint motion.
@Moggelishes And yes, I never use touchpads. On all my ThinkPads touchpads are off, forever. :)
@Umka Wow, didn&#39;t know they had developed it so much!
@Umka That&#39;s rather extreme, haha 😂
@Moggelishes Call me Trackstrimist. :)

Thank you! The entire top of the laptop is aluminum. While the bottom part is plastic :)
@Moggelishes thank you :) the part around keyboard is also plastic? Is the keyboard sturdy enough so it doesn&#39;t bend? Sorry for so many questions :D
I tried right now. This plastic is really strong. No flex in the chassis. Keyboard flexes a LITTLE if you push super hard (which you shouldn&#39;t do) so id give this the full pass
@Moggelishes thank you once again :) I am thinking of buying this laptop and no shop has it displayed so I appreciate your help
If you have any more questions I&#39;m happy to answer. I made this video to help others like me who had a hard time finding info.
@Conox Olivander I have to add here. ONLY the bottom part around the keyboard is plastic. The actual bottom that sits on the table or your lap is also made out of aluminum!
@Moggelishes dude can you tell me about the integrated graphics on this thing and how much it can handle games like gta5and such 64gb ones)

Id say it&#39;s possible. If you want to play at 1920x1080 you can expect between 20-30 fps. But at 1280x720p it should be very playable. It&#39;s not a gaming laptop, but I&#39;ve done a lot of gaming myself and right now Ryzen 4000 series integrated graphics are the best available so for non-gaming laptops this is as good as it gets.
@Moggelishes that&#39;s cool

Yes for sure. As I said, the only time it might get too dim is in direct sunlight, but even then its ok, but not good.

That&#39;s the reason I made it! Thank you for watching. My very first attempt on a YT video!
@Krutang Desai Did you receive your laptop? If u did, could you please tell if WVA = IPS? I really want to buy this.. But it only says WVA panel..
@Debadipti Patra It said WVA for me too... For everyone. But it&#39;s IPS. I know my stuff.
Did you buy this from Lenovo E Store... There&#39;s no OS included for 60k price tag...
@Varun Kumar u r getting so much for 60k price tag.. and particularly i am not concerned because i will be installing linux
Can you please send me the link?
@Harshil Bulsara  No bro that&#39;s not the one...wait I&#39;ll send you the link and it has an ips display 1080p and it&#39;s currently on lenovo india website for base price of 59k and the necessary spec upgrades will cost you around 62k
@Moggelishes yes brother it&#39;s an ips panel and instead of lenovo providing ryzen 7 4700u I&#39;m getting it from hp with ryzen 5 4600H and nvidea 1650 4gb graphics I&#39;ll send you both the links if you want🍻
Yes please share the link
@Harshil Bulsara  you can customise the specs before you buy but the processor will be the same
@Krutang Desai 😂 sorry bro I&#39;ve shared the wrong link.. my research history is fucked up.. 🤦
@Krutang Desai yes ... this is the one 👍 but you guys sure it&#39;s an IPS display? do any of you got the device?
@Debadipti Patra  few weeks ago it as showing ips display but now its showing wva and it produces better colors than ips display so i am not sure how to feel about this😂
@Krutang Desai one guy from lenovo support told me this is 100% sRGB.. not sure if he was kidding 😂
@Debadipti Patra  it can be true because you get better colour reproduction at the tiny cost of viewing angles. and wva displays very much behaves like micro led displays in terms of color reproduction but the fundamental tech is different 😛🍻
@Debadipti Patra E14 Gen2 offers both TN and WVA (IPS) display options depending on where it is sold. In India they are offering WVA at 250 nits whereas TN comes with 300 nits. WVA offers Wider viewing angles, Greater variety of colors and Improved color accuracy but slower response times and refresh rates compared to TN<br><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/nz/en/faqs/pc-life-faqs/what-is-ips/">https://www.lenovo.com/nz/en/faqs/pc-life-faqs/what-is-ips/</a><br>and if you want to dig deeper ... <a href="https://www.techspot.com/article/1788-display-tech-compared/">https://www.techspot.com/article/1788-display-tech-compared/</a>

​@Krutang Desai  I am in india,  lenovo support says india model has only  1 ssd customizatible ssd , there is no second empty ssd slot,  can you confirm,  if there is an empty slot.  This is dealbreaker as I need at least 1tb ssd.  Please reply if it has extra empty ssd slot available.

@Suresh Mali Sadly.. there is no empty slot for an additional SSD..
@Debadipti Patra  sad, btw did u get ur   order another user mentioned , he did not get his
@Suresh Mali nope.. not yet..
@Debadipti Patra hows the laptop now? Are you still using it? Would love to hear a long term usage experience from you
@Yanni Shams Zaman laptop has been grest! Got Windows 11 update and it&#39;s running like butter. I was a little bit concerned about only 8GB Ram, but it&#39;s totally fine. Display is a no no (External monitor required if you do anything professional). Camera is okaish. Older title games are running smoothly with integrated graphics (but no latest titles)
@Yanni Shams Zaman I have dual booted with Fedora, and it&#39;s been awesome (all are working fine including power profiles and fingerprint)
@Debadipti Patra Thank you so much. I was a bit ambiguous on whether to buy a thinkpad or a thinkbook. But after hearing it from you, i think its better to go for a thinkpad

Oh, I totally forgot. I use it 50% of the time. It&#39;s super quick and convenient! Thank you for pointing that out!
yes thanks i was wondering too!

This is not the same internals as the laptop in my review. So I&#39;d be careful and not trust this too much.

Couldn&#39;t agree more!
Dude, I got mine for 600 euros ! R7 4700U, 16GB, 256gb SSD, IPS Panel and AX module. I am in love with this laptop. Only issue I have with it is the Screen brightness which is only 250nits max so It&#39;s kinda hard to see when there&#39;s light.
Wow. What a steal!!! And with 16 gigs as well. Agree there with the screen but otherwise, good for you!
Do you guys think this is good for university work, streaming and typing on google docs?
@Greta S For sure! I use it for school and it&#39;s brilliant. The keyboard especially is excellent. Streaming should be a breeze considering you have 6 or 8 cores in this machine.
@Greta S Sure! I&#39;m doing code and a little Data Science with,  it&#39;s working great ! mine are 16Go and 512SSD
Thanks!!!
@Greta S Oh definitely, it&#39;s great, as long as you don&#39;t use it outside it&#39;s wonderful
@Nathan B  im thinking of getting the thinkpad yoga l380 because the cheaper e14 is sold out in my country and the more expensive one is comparable in price to the yoga. They seem pretty similar tho, the yoga has a better screen at 300 nits.
@Greta S isn&#39;t it like the Yoga7, I thought about buying this one back then, it&#39;s a good laptop. But then I remembered how satisfying the Thinkpads keyboards were 😂😂😂
Have to agree here. The Yoga screen is better sure. But if you are not editing video or photo this will do. The ThinkPad is more solid, and better performing and more comfortable as well!
@Moggelishes  yeah i would totally have gotten this but its sold out here! Just ordered the yoga. I like to read articles a lot (I have a subscription to medium etc.) so being able to put it in portrait mode is attractive to me.
@Greta S Comment again when you get it and experience for a while, I&#39;d like your feedback ! :)
@Nathan B  i will!!
@Nathan B  I&#39;ve had i for like 5 days now, im really enjoying it so far!! The only issue I have had is that I get a faint crackling from the speaker when nothing is playing, but I think it&#39;s a software issue that I&#39;ll hopefully be able to sort out. <br>I like:<br> - the keyboard (but the backlighting is meh unless it&#39;s really dark)<br> - the display<br> - the responsiveness of the touch screen<br> - fully capable of doing everything I need it to (browsing, online school, netflix, loading large documents in google drive)<br> - battery life!!!<br> - the fact that it has a USB port (my mac didnt and i hated using the dongle thing)<br> - it connects automatically to my bluetooth devices even after being turned off (macbook didnt) <br>Not a fan of:<br> - that weird speaker issue I mentioned<br> - the trackpad (very bad, trackpoint is good tho)<br> - slightly heavier than macbook
@Nathan B where are you from?
@Vivek Gopal I&#39;m from France, why ?
@Nathan B  the price of thinkpad varies from  countries to country and 600EURis a great deal for the specs you have got. By the way I am from India and the same specs costs nearly 750EUD here (without OS).
@Vivek Gopal Oh wow that&#39;s a lot more. I mean mine was supposed to be 819€, but with the Student discount, the newsletter code and IGraal it totalled at 583€ which is crazy !
@Nathan B where did you order it from?
@Nathan B do you have a link for the shop?
@global warming is real I ordered from the official Lenovo website (French one) and it was pre-release as well, and also I got the student discount AND there was a sale that turned the upgrade of the cpu (base R5 4500u) to the r7 4700u for only 10 eur lol. Then I used the Newsletter discount in the cart, cause the student already lowers the prices before the cart. And I used IGraal and I got like 25 bucks back too... I&#39;ll try to get you a link, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be able to buy it...

My understanding of Bioinformatics is that you do both computer science and biology. Meaning you handle a lot of data.<br><br>This laptop would be great for it. Thinkpads are widely known as the best windows laptop for programmers. And if you get the 4700U CPU you can do a lot of heavier tasks with ease. I would recommend it!
Moggelishes perfect, thanks!

There is no thunderbolt... Because it&#39;s AMD. So I don&#39;t think so :(

Thank you for sharing! You got the top spec I see. Only missing the 4800U. Also thanks for watching!😀👍
Yess!! Finally found someone who got it with a long 1TB SSD preinstalled. Could you please help me out and tell me if yours has a heatsink plate for the second SSD?<br>(Pictures/explanation here: <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-11e-Windows-13-E-and-Edge-series-Laptops/E14-Gen-2-E15-Gen-2-secondary-SSD-cooling/m-p/5037135">https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/ThinkPad-11e-Windows-13-E-and-Edge-series-Laptops/E14-Gen-2-E15-Gen-2-secondary-SSD-cooling/m-p/5037135</a> )
@why am I wasting my time on this I know that it has a thermal pad. It also has venting in the chassis specifically for that m.2. Don&#39;t know if it has a plate...
How is heat management of the laptop after using continuously for few hours and how is the battery life?
Heat management is quite good! You have a very effective CPU and also more heatpipes compared to gen 1 models. Battery is also very good thanks to that amazing CPU. You easily get through a day of school or similar.
@Proddatur Naga Venkata Shravan heat management is, more like, okay. Blowing out hot air on the display is questionable and doesn&#39;t let the heat get away quickly. Under constant load (like, 100% CPU running 24/7) it stabilizes at 15W at ~65C° (26C° room temp) in Balanced mode or 22W at 80+ C° in Performance mode and everything gets pretty hot, BUT with a good laptop cooling pad it manages to maintain 20W at 66C° in Balanced or 28W at 78C° in Performance mode. So, it&#39;s okay, but it&#39;s not quite  a workstation that can run for days at max frequencies without getting even remotely hot.<br>Bottom of mine is made of aluminum, so it probably acts like a heatsink too.
@why am I wasting my time on this I have 2 WD SSDs preinstalled, a WDC PC SN530 with 512 GB &amp; a WDC PC SN730 with 1 TB. Both are quite fast. As there&#39;s no need to clean the fan yet, I won&#39;t open my E14. I have the AUO B140HAN04.0 IPS display which is FreeSync compatible.
@why am I wasting my time on this You must be confusing E14 with Dell types that blows out hot air over the display on the open position. E14 vent outs on the side. Also, no laptop will survive at 100% CPU running 24/7, even enterprise class servers don&#39;t run or designed to run at 100% CPU, it will certainly cause serious issues. CPU spiking to 100% just for few minutes is OK but certainly not 24/7
@Bex Admin no offense, but:<br>•Both Gen1(Intel) and Gen2 (the one reviewed here) have vents blowing on the hinge/display, check their respective Hardware Maintenance Manuals<br>•I&#39;d recommend looking into BOINC/similar distributed computing stuff. People crunch 24/7 for science/humanitarian causes. As long as you don&#39;t mess with voltages and keep thermals under control, I don&#39;t see how can there be any usage-related problems.

Yes there is. If you watched the video you would&#39;ve known😉. But yes. 8gb is solderd to the board and you got an empty SODIMM.
@Moggelishes Lol I saw the video but still was not sure due to that plate. Sorry!
Is the keyboard backlit?
Yes, you can order with or without backlit keyboard.

Also great review, keep it up!
As I said before. It&#39;s very similar in all aspects. Which means it&#39;s a brilliant laptop for the price. Especially with the powerful ryzen 7! Two key diffrences are:<br>- The display is 15.6&quot; instead of 14&quot;<br>- The keyboard is a full size one (it has a numpad)<br>The battery is the same 45Wh though.

You won&#39;t be disappointed! I can tell you that much👍👍👍

Wow that&#39;s a long time. Mine was delivered in 1-2 workdays. Oh well, you have something to look forward too!
@Moggelishes in lenovo india, only custom build version available so default delivery time 6 to 8 weeks... Really bad option...
@Venkata Siva I see. But I hope it is perfect for you when it arrives! 😀
@Moggelishes  yes, i am happy about my order after seeing your review...
What estimated date did lenovo give for the delivery how long is it?
@Priyadarshini Poojary For me it was 1-2 weekdays. But I live in Sweden...
I also ordered but it is taking 8 weeks time
@Venkata Siva does it have backlit keyboard??

@Suresh Mali not received my laptop...my order get cancelled by lenovo due to no parts stock to manufacture laptop...not sure on second ssd slot
@Venkata Siva  sad, so difficult to get ryzen laptops
@Suresh Mali due to popularity of Ryzen laptops i feel like intel laptop rates come down so i will buy intel laptop if found any festival deals...
@Venkata Siva how can it be cancelled ? I mean how can they cancel ? If you ordered it , It was in stock right ? So how can they say that ?
@Godavari Lekhak No idea...but they gave me my money promptly...
@Venkata Siva how much time did you waited Before the cancellation email. That&#39;s not fair man, that&#39;s literally a scam<br><br>&gt; You bought when it was in stock<br>&gt; After many time they told not available<br>&gt; It&#39;s literally a scam lol no matter even if they returned your money<br><br>I am worried cuz I have ordered the same lol

Thank you so much. Means a lot 😀👍
How is it?

It&#39;s more or less the same! Full size keyboard is one difference I suppose. Great purchase nonetheless!
@JarStrand I want to buy the e15 gen 2 with the ryzen 7. Any flaws or things I should watch out for?
@Thomas Van Geldre I know you asked JarStand. But the only difference is the battery, screen size and a full size keyboard.
Thanks men! I think you have one of the only reviews on this device and I have seen none of the e15 gen2
@Thomas Van Geldre That is the reason I made it. Got so frustrated when there were 0 reviews and bad info everywhere. Thanks for the comments either way!

Nice choice! It might be hard to believe, but it&#39;s actually that good. Thank you for watching!
Love mine! A Mac equivalent is around 3 times the price here in Aus
Does it have a backlit keyboard?
Vivek g yup

Thank you...

Thank you so very much. Truly means a lot to me 👍

Thank you very much! I really appreciate it!👍

I see. That is a good idea. The VA isn&#39;t very good. It&#39;s bad in almost all laptops.
There are no options called &quot;IPS&quot;. If you look at their PSREF, Lenovo lists all the non-TN display options as &quot;WVA&quot; instead of &quot;IPS&quot; for these new Thinkpads like E14, L14, T14, X13 etc. So I think their WVA = IPS.
@JTD I actually saw that when I looked at the PSREF. But their official website said IPS. A bit confusing... But thanks for the insight!
@JTD 😮
@Moggelishes exaactly I thought the same.. so you have also WVA panel right ?🤔
@madhawanand lekhak I suppose i have. The official website said IPS but if WVA=IPS then yea its WVA.
@Moggelishes lol, It must me IPS cuz I checked the psref of all thinkpads like E14 (intel), 490 they all have WVA written in psref but they do come with an option of IPS in the website ( they have 3 screen options in site 1- FHD 2- FHD WVA 3- FHD IPS ) so 🤔
Yea! Then you go right ahead and order that beast of a laptop! Also thank you for clarifying the confusion on the websites...👍
@madhawanand lekhak i am from India .. Lenovo india only has WVA panel it seems.. But inside the cart page it says IPS.. idk if I should order or not.. I do not want VA panel
If you read all the other comments here you will see that WVA = IPS. So you go right ahead and order it. No worries.

Couldn&#39;t agree more. I feel sorry for you. These new ryzen 4000 chips are truly something else.
How is it versus the gen 1 amd radeon rx 640 gpu?<br>Im thinking about 2 models:<br>Gen 1 i7 16gb, amd radeon rx 640 Gpu.<br><br>Gen 2 ryzen 7 16gb, integrated gpu.
@Nir Losner I&#39;ve heard cooling on the Gen1 (Intel) is worse (single heat pipe vs dual on the Gen2) and the graphics card throttles so much that it almost becomes pointless, not to mention worse battery life because, well, there&#39;s a discrete graphics card.<br>I bought a Gen2 with Ryzen 7/8GB/256GB for around $740 and added another 8GB of RAM (DDR4-3200) by myself for $40.
@why am I wasting my time on this but isnt the discrete gpu on the gen 1 have better performance?<br>Its not the best but its still no integrated.
@Nir Losner <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/fdavxf/thermal_performance_on_the_e14_with_amd_radeon/">https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/fdavxf/thermal_performance_on_the_e14_with_amd_radeon/</a><br>besides, even Ryzen 5 4500U outperforms i7-10710U in benchmarks, and it probably costs less
@why am I wasting my time on this Well just noticed that the gen 2 is still not available in my country for the next month or two and im starting to learn in october so nevermind i guess....<br>But thank you very much, guess my next one will be amd powered..

Yes. It&#39;s surprisingly good!

Suggest me best laptop under 55000
ThinkPad e14 FHD IPS display 300 nits 100% sRGB is listed on Amazon for ₹66k &amp; TN display for ₹55k. Both are configured to 8/16+512 gb, Ryzen 5 Hexa core. Should I go for it? My work relates data analytics mostly. Don&#39;t play games at all on PC. Love watching movies and the 4k 8k videos available on YouTube. <br>Please suggest.
Confused between ThinkPad e14 (for its MIL std. durability, keyboard) &amp; MSI modern 14 b10mw ( keyboard, display). E14 runs on Ryzen 5 Hexa core and the MSI runs on i5 10 th gen. In ThinkPad e14, FHD Anti-glare TN display is used, whereas in msi FHD IPS 60 hz display is in use. MSI also claims that this laptop meets the MIL STD. 810g durability. ThinkPad e14 is priced around 55K INR &amp; the latter 45k INR. Which one do you suggest to buy?<br>Usage is:-<br>1. Data visualization, analytics <br>2. 4k video editing <br>3. Light gaming<br><br>** I require a rough laptop that can handle the tantrums.
During my 5 years of corporate life, I have always been given Thinkpad T series laptop and I love the Thinkpad series. They are one of the best legendary windows laptops with a great keyboard. Kids won&#39;t understand this laptop. My personal laptop is a 2013 ThinkPad T431s and it is still working fine.

The display is not as bad as the reviews i read in Flipkart.. picture quality looks decent...
Thinkpad are made from Carbon Fibre. They are military grade, offer lot of customization. They are for &quot;those who do&quot; and not for show-off. Thinkpad are not meant for gaming so don&#39;t test these for gaming. These are business laptops. So demo should be from business laptop perspective 🙂

Is there any other model of same laptop with dedicated Graphics Card as well?
Sir kitne Gb ram h laptop ki
Hi bro, I have the same laptop. Been using it for the past 5 months. Awesome performance. Only area of issue I have is the battery degradation. Currently, it has reduced to 42.33 Wh compared to the initial 45 Wh, while checking on the lenovo vantage application. When I checked with a friend of mine, his ideapad with 35 Wh battery had degraded only to 33 Wh, even after using for 2 years. Does anyone else have the same issue?



Good to play DotA 2?


brother pls reply....on amazon..in costumer review and qna...people are saying that it has a tn display panel and have a very bad viewing angel..so it is good to buy?
ThinkPad is a business series line. Build Quality is best in any laptop, ever. Military grade specs.



Decent review 👍🙂<br>On a lighter note brother -- 45 MWhr battery??? 😬 Can you imagine the size and how long it will take to fully charge? Let alone to discharge.

Bro video me cutscenes me kon sa game hai?
hey bro , i am a wildlife reserch  student and i am into games like war thunder and world of warships most of all i need a rugged laptop  , will thinkpad e14 4650u be a good option for me or could you suggest me a better laptop my budget is 55k , i would really appreciate if you would tell me




Does it have backlight in keyboard
Can you stress the CPU ( how much Max TDP it uses) as more tdp than the processor limits may results in throttling.. you can use CPUZ to stress test. ( there is an issue in various lenovo laptops relating TDP /source : lenovo forum)
isme Adobe Premiere Pro smoothly chalega?











Which Brands&#39;s Soldered RAM they Provide?
So should I prefer this over a IdeaPad 5 slim with a ryzen 7 or 5 4700u or 5700u or a hp 14 ryzen 5 5500u, or should I go for something better than this e14? Im kinda confused 🤔, I need a lap which has a great screen and can do a decent amount of gaming, suggest me the best one among the ones I mentioned or if there&#39;s anything better please lemme know

Second I guess

First!
"What's going on, guys? It is Bernardo and you  just saw a quick unboxing on Lenovo's ThinkPad E14"
"Generation 2 laptop. So what comes inside the  box? We have our safety and warranty guide"
"we have the thinkpad e 14 gen 2 setup guide. Cool."
"We have our 65 watt power supply with a type  C connection and we have our power cable."
"Now I'm going to take the power cable and  the power adapter and I'm going to hook it up"
"awesome. Cool. We'll going to  put this stuff to the side."
"And then last but not least, we have the beautiful  ThinkPad E 14 generation two laptop weighing"
"around 3.4 with a thickness of 0.72 inches. Now  using this laptop and reviewing it for you guys"
"I had a lot of fun super powerful with the  Windows 11 operating system installed on it."
"All right so before we open this guy up and  power it on let's look at some of the ports"
"and features now if you had a laptop to the  point that you're able to open it up like this"
"on your right hand side we have  the following ports we have"
"one 2.0 USB port and then we have  our RJ 45 port or Ethernet port."
"On the left hand side we have our  combo audio Jack, a HDMI port a 3.2"
"USB always on charging and our Type C  port, which also allows us to hook up"
"our power cable. All right. So we just  went over some of the ports of features"
"on the ThinkPad E 14 generation two laptop.  So let's open this guy up real quick"
"oh look at that beautiful 14 inch display and  we will talk about the display pretty soon."
"So don't worry about that. Let's talk about  the power button which is located right here."
"And the power button is actually integrated with  the fingerprint scanner. So it's a one shot deal."
"So let's turn it on. Like I said before,  the fingerprint scanner is integrated with"
"the power button, so you don't really need to do  anything, just power it on and you're good to go."
"But if you guys want to see it in action, so  let's lock it real quick it's already locked."
"It's locked and we use the  fingerprint scanner and scan in,"
"Boom. All right. So let's talk about the  trackpad on the E 14 now the trackpad"
"measurement is around 3.98 inches using it. I  didn't have any issues at all. I did find myself"
"plugging in a USB mouse half the time you do  have the option to use a track point on the E 14."
"So that's an option there. And you could  take advantage of the left and right click"
"options at the top or the keyboard on the  E 14. Again, it is a ThinkPad keyboard. I"
"usually don't have any issues with these  keyboards. It's super responsive I love the"
"way it feels on my fingertips. So again,  I didn't have any issues on the keyboard."
"Now the keyboard is back lit. That works well  if you're working at night. The measurements"
"between each key is around 0.13 inches now  for speakers on the E 14 actually located on"
"the left and right hand side at the bottom of  the laptop. If the laptop is on a hard surface,"
"you get a pretty loud sound because the sound  is actually bouncing off the hard surface."
"The loudness that I got on the speakers was  around 92.3 decibels. Now for the display"
"like I said before, it is 14 inches Full HD  with a resolution of 1920 by 1080. It is anti"
"glare for the brightness level right now I  think this is the highest on the brightness"
"and this is the lowest and again this is the  highest and this is the lowest that it could go."
"And again this is the highest if you want to  know about nits, I think between 220 and 300,"
"it all depends on the model that you get at  the Lenovo site. The E 14 does have HDR enabled"
"within Windows ten but only for streaming content  online. Now the refresh rate for this particular"
"model is around 60.05 Hertz. Now the scaling  of the display by default comes around 150%."
"I found like the icons in the fonts were too  big for me, so I had to reduce it around 125%."
"125% for me was great. It's nice size and  the icons are not huge like popping out"
"right in front of me at the top of the display  you do have a 720 webcam with a privacy guard"
"right next to the webcam you  have your dual mic system."
"All right. So the performance on the E 14 was  awesome. It was on point with the specifications"
"that Lenovo sent me. So if I'm going to actually  do a command, I typically do right click on the"
"taskbar. So I'm going to hold the control shift  and then escape, and that's going to bring up"
"the task manager. Let's do more details  and let's open this guy up real quick."
"Let's do performance. I'm going to right click  on the CPU change graph to a logical processor."
"Awesome. So this machine is actually  running 11th gen Intel Core i5 1135"
"G seven CPU what clock speed of 2.40 gigahertz as  one socket four cores eight logical processors."
"It's a good machine now for memory.  It only has around eight gigs."
"It does come with a solid state  drive which is around 256 gigs."
"And for the graphics card it comes with  the Intel Iris XE Graphics. Now what the"
"specification is on the E 14 I was able to  do so much I was able to do my editing within"
"premiere. I was able to edit audio within  audition as well as render 4K within media encoder"
"and editing 4K files was really simple because  I didn't need to create any proxy files."
"I was also able to do a little bit  of coloring within to Vinci Resolve,"
"which was a huge plus. Now this guy does get  hot around this area right here and around here."
"When I use my heat gun, I got a temperature  of around 94 degrees. So you got to make sure,"
"you know, if you put it on  your lap, it will get warm."
"Now, this guy does have vents. He has vents at  the bottom of the laptop as well as in between the"
"display right here. Now for gaming on the ThinkPad  e 14. I was able to play jump force without any"
"lag, which I was super impressed because of the  graphics card. It's only running an Intel Iris"
"XE graphics card, but I was actually able to  do some combos on this machine without any lag."
"All right. So let's look at the battery life  on the ThinkPad E 14 gen two from Lenovo."
"So I'm going to close out the task manager  and for every laptop I like to use PC mark ten"
"and run three performance tests. Now the first  one is all about the modern office battery life."
"And what it basically does is uses Excel word  PowerPoint goes on line, edit some photos"
"until the battery reaches around 2% and then dies."
"The battery life on this test took around 7  hours and 20 minutes on my second test, I ran"
"video battery life and it took around 9 hours and  45 minutes. And my last test was all about gaming"
"and it took around 2 hours and 41 minutes average  without using PC mark ten. I was using the machine"
"with my editing with premiere doing some  color correction with De Vinci, resolve"
"play some games going online  editing some Photoshop files."
"I was able to get between six and a half  to 7 hours of battery life on this machine,"
"but it all depends on how you use  it. All right, so let's conclude"
"our unboxing slash review on the Lenovo's  ThinkPad E 14 generation two laptop."
"So the laptop, I didn't have a chance to hook up  an external monitor, but you do have that HDMI"
"port to just hook up an external monitor and  you're good to go now for starting price on the"
"E 14 generation two, you can get it under $700,  but it all depends on how you get it configured."
"At the Lenovo site, it goes up  to $1,000. I think that's like"
"close to the highest price point on this machine.  But again, like I said, it all depends on how you"
"get it configured. Now overall, our experience on  this machine, I had a lot of fun, especially with"
"Windows 11. I believe Windows 11 kind of enhances  all the features on this particular laptop,"
"which was a plus using it with premiere, Audition,  Photoshop, Da Vinci Resolve using Camtasia,"
"going online, watching video, watching  movies and stuff, listening to music."
"It was perfect. It's a great overall  starting laptop if you need to travel"
"and do your day to day stuff on it. Now, one of  the cool things about this laptop is it's not"
"touch screen, which again, like I said, throughout  all my videos, I don't like touchscreen laptops"
"which the E 14 isn't, which is great. One thing  it does lack for me is it lacks an SD card slot."
"I would definitely love to see on this machine a  SD card slot because, you know, I could take my SD"
"card slots out of my cameras plug it in, you know,  hook it up to this laptop and start dragging and"
"drop in the photos and my videos on to the machine  so I could start editing. I actually got it to get"
"an SD card reader dongle, plug it in and then  that's the way I could retrieve my information."
"But that's the only thing that  this machine kind of lacks"
"because it does come with an Ethernet  port. I could hard wire in to get fast"
"Internet speeds, which is a plus, and that's it.  Hopefully you enjoyed this unboxing slash review"
"on Lenovo's ThinkPad E 14 generation two laptop  and I catch you guys on the next one peace out."
"get everyone be asian dad here how you"
"guys doing hope you guys are doing very"
"well and feeling healthy and safe over"
"here doing all right as always and i can"
"see around the world we're starting to"
"get out of restrictions as well as"
"lockdown which is fantastic to hear and"
"hopefully we're actually going to be on"
"the road map to getting our normal lives"
"back which is"
"very good all right today we're going to"
"do the unboxing and first impression of"
"this lenovo thinkpad e14 gen 2"
"so this is a thinkpad which means it is"
"a business class laptop which is great"
"so which means they can take a bit of"
"beating and this is the e class now the"
"e class is the entry model to the"
"thinkpad range now i'm not new to the"
"thinkpad range i've actually played with"
"the t-series x series as well as p"
"series but i've never played with an"
"e-series so this is new to me completely"
"now this one i've got here specifically"
"is the ryzen 5 version now i've actually"
"tested ryzen 5 in another laptop and"
"that chip has blown me away i was amazed"
"by this performance and i've also done"
"the ryzen 7 version work and that was"
"even more staggering very good"
"so"
"after well i did get this on one of the"

"away here oh this is"
"a very smooth feel to"
"the thinkpads i am loving this sort of"
"texture to it very different to"
"the"
"t series and x series as well the p"
"series then kind of more of a matte sort"
"of feel to them this is not a matter"
"this is a more smoother feel to it like"
"it is still it's still got that you know"
"plastic small looks like plastic it is"
"um uh pva or something but my god i love"
"to feel these here this has a very good"
"feel to it uh for sure so anyway let's"
"quickly look at what ports there is"
"before i open this thing up okay looking"
"on the right i'm sorry left hand side of"
"the computer we've got uh one usb c port"
"so i'm taking this is a 3.2 gen 2 port"
"it's not going to be thunderbolt because"
"this one here is an amd and they don't"
"have thunderbolt because that's"
"exclusive to intel computers then we've"
"got a normal type a port for usb so"
"that's probably usb 3.1 gen1 port and"
"then we've got hmi port more than likely"
"that will be version 1.4 b and then"
"we'll get the headphone jack combo jack"
"which is great uh nothing along the"
"front and nothing along the back"
"and then on the right hand side we've"
"got the security lock slot and then"
"we've got the ethernet port"
"ethernet port fantastic on a little bit"
"of the lever system there that's good to"
"see that's still got the ethernet port a"
"lot of the other think pads from the t"
"series they've lost the ethernet port so"
"good to see that e series has got sorry"
"t series before is what i mentioned and"
"so it's good to see t and p and x all"
"right i've lost the ethernet port so"
"you've got to buy a dongle for that but"
"this has got it i liking that and then"
"we've got another usb 3.1 gen1 port"
"which is type a port which is great to"
"see and that's about all there is so"
"there's no micro sd card reader for this"
"but that's not that bad for it really so"
"i am excited i love the feel of this"
"this has got a very nice smooth"
"and that's for fingerprints it does grab"
"a little but not crazy amount like"
"compared to the t series and i'm going"
"to get one of my helpers out here"
"so we can actually just make this bring"
"this up so i'll pop it up so you can see"
"there's a little bit better anyway so"
"anyway let's gonna open this up together"
"now one finger test it does open up one"
"finger because it's great oh it does"
"pretty well with one finger"
"oh yeah it goes all the way one finger"
"that's not bad here"
"not bad at all now this one is a"
"clamshell one so it won't go past the"
"180 degrees oh i'm impressed by that"
"okay we don't need keyboard cover oh"
"this is nice i am loving the"
"oh the keys on this is really nice it's"
"got the"
"carbon so x series keyboard in there so"
"it's got that smooth texture for each"
"individual key and of course being a"
"pink pad it's got the big pad keyboard i"
"love it because it's got plenty of"
"tactile feel to it good key travel good"
"spacing in between as well and now of"
"course they've got that famous track"
"point oh the g sports what they call it"
"just because where it's located and then"
"you've got your supporting free buttons"
"on below the"
"space bar and i can actually see the"
"space bar here it's also got the"
"backlight so it's function spacebar will"
"get your backlight and of course usually"
"it's about three settings for that off"
"middle and high for the backlight as"
"well and then your typical thinkpad"
"trackpad here which is of course"
"mechanical on the bottom so it's hinged"
"on the top and it's mechanical the bomb"
"so you can just do that and as for the"
"texture wise it's got a bit of a smooth"
"matte feel to that too as well which is"
"great and i can see there's actually a"
"fingerprint reader"
"located where the power button is well"
"too and that's located on the side here"
"whoa that's very different there as well"
"too so that's nice to see that they've"
"got that engraved they don't have that"
"in their t-series"
"that's located separately with"
"fingerprints so i like the e series at"
"the moment it is a ryzen 5 version here"
"as well i can see from the sticker here"
"as well so that you should be i think"
"there are six cores as well too which is"
"great so definitely good win there now"
"let's gonna try and file this computer"
"up here"
"uh i can also see the new keys for 2020"
"is the"
"from f9 to f11 they're the real"
"conferencing keys and that's new to 2020"
"as well and an f12 is the customization"
"button where you can customize to"
"anything you want uh you do that in the"
"software anyway anyway let's try and"
"build this thing up"
"and i can see straight away also you i"
"can see the vents are located behind the"
"hinge there are two types of vents i can"
"see probe ones is exhaust and one is"
"actually"
"i think it's a"
"brief hole as well too because it's got"
"different type of grille on there all"
"right but let's have a look is it"
"turning on i've never had very good luck"
"in turning these things on on camera but"
"i will have it really ready to go"
"because i know you're more than likely"
"you need to plug this in power so here i"
"go i'll grab one here"
"all right okay i've got a power cable"
"here"
"here we go all right let's plug that in"
"and hopefully we've got that thing"
"charged and we'll just turn this baby on"
"oh so the power button already has a"
"nice sort of glow to the power button"
"it's white that goes around the"
"fingerprint reader and i can definitely"
"see"
"there's not much of the bezel on the"
"side for sure that is good and along the"
"bottom even then the bottom it doesn't"
"have that much better i'm thinking this"
"is really nice compared to even to the t"
"series as well so and as the top while"
"it's got a little bit of bezel but not"
"crazy i would call this"
"probably"
"slim"
"medium it's probably what i would call"
"it narrow medium it's not like narrow"
"it's not medium but it's about"
"a medium narrow maybe that's the word"
"i'll turn out and of course there's a"
"720p webcam on top and i can see there's"
"a privacy shadows just made a good old"
"flick of the switch and you have a"
"physical shadow on there so that's great"
"to see they've also included that in"
"there now as for the display wise it is"
"this one doesn't have of course no touch"
"uh but it's got a very matte feel look"
"to it as well so it's not a glossy one"
"it's a matte look too"
"and that is a sixteen by nine"
"for the rec"
"ratio so i'm going to quickly go through"
"the setup and i do want to fire up the"
"speakers on this because i can see there"
"are two speakers located on the bottom"
"and i'll just have a quick sound of what"
"it sounds like and i can just give you a"
"quick feedback on the sound so i've got"
"the computer all set up and i had a bit"
"of a play with the computer very quickly"
"and especially with the audio and i've"
"got to say i'm pretty impressed by the"
"audio here i was expecting pretty"
"average sound and it did a lot better"
"than average it's actually got a lot of"
"bass and i found when i was actually"
"flipping this computer around it says"
"audio by harman so it actually has a"
"little bit of oomph here for the sound"
"and it's actually quite balanced as well"
"and it's actually got pretty good"
"acoustics i'm surprising that comes out"
"of these two small speakers they really"
"did surprise me i actually better than"
"the t series uh they're not up at the x"
"series level yet but they're better than"
"the t series and the p series as well so"
"that is very surprising for coming"
"straight from uh entry model which is"
"the e series so"
"i am very impressed with the audio here"
"now as for the display eyes it could"
"it's only about 220 nits i think this"
"one is which is full hd that's kind of"
"all you expect but i do wish it was a"
"little bit more bright at them i've got"
"some about four lights here glaring at"
"it so it's why it looks a little bit dim"
"here but when the lights aren't that"
"bright uh you'll be doing okay when"
"you're indoors and in office type work"
"but if you're coming outdoors you'll"
"probably be struts to struggle"
"especially in daylight and stuff like"
"that so uh for like coffee sort of dates"
"and stuff though or doing"
"work in a coffee shop i think you'll be"
"more better than sitting indoors and"
"sitting outdoors you'll probably start"
"to struggle a little before the"
"brightness of the display anyway so but"
"overall this computer has been pretty"
"amazing"
"blowing my expectation what the e series"
"is"
"i'm very impressed by this e-series now"
"i will with my follow-up video i will be"
"looking at its temperatures as well with"
"fan noise i'll also look at the"
"internals as well in the performance of"
"this computer now this is horizon five"
"so i expect it to be pretty decent here"
"anyway i hope you catch one of those"
"amazing black friday deals and as always"
"if ha if you find this video informative"
"and enjoyed it smack that like for me"
"just to support my channel as well and"
"if you haven't done already subscribe to"
"my channel but hit it subscribe button"
"bottom screen i do upload a new video"
"every week and just remember"
"imperfections in life makes it beautiful"
"and interesting i'll see you next video"
"laptop manufacturers rarely change the"
"visual design of their second or even"
"third generation devices"
"such is the case with thinkpad e14"
"generation ii by lenovo which looks just"
"the same as its predecessor but now"
"sports a thunderbolt 4 port and upgraded"
"internals in the same rigid chassis"
"the lid is made out of aluminum while"
"the rest of the case is plastic"
"this results in a rather light machine"
"that stops the scales at around 1.6"
"kilos and has a thickness of under 19"
"millimeters"
"also this notebook sits quite high above"
"the ground thanks to its large back foot"
"this results in more breathing space for"
"the fan typically thinkpad devices are"
"equipped with great keyboards and this"
"one is not an exclusion"
"additionally you get the legendary track"
"point a feature some people prefer over"
"the regular touchpad"
"on the left side you will find a"
"thunderbolt 4 connector usb type a 3.2"
"generation 1 port an hdmi 1.4 b"
"connector and an audio jack"
"at the right side you will find a"
"kensington lock slot an rj45 connector"
"and a usb type a 2.0 generation 1 port"
"this laptop offers one sodom slot for"
"memory upgrades this allows you to"
"expand the 8 gigabytes of soldered ram"
"with up to 32 gigabytes more"
"additionally there are two m2 storage"
"slots they fit 42 and 80 millimeters"
"drives if you want to see how to open"
"the laptop you can check out our"
"teardown video"
"only 2 per 100 people watching this"
"video are subscribers if you decide to"
"just start following us we'll be able to"
"reinvest more in our laboratory thus"
"making even more helpful videos for you"
"thank you you're awesome"
"this notebook's 1080p ips display has"
"wide viewing angles and a good contrast"
"ratio of"
"1150 to 1."
"as with most business devices in this"
"price range it covers only 50 of the"
"srgb gamut which results in a dull"
"looking image"
"thankfully the panel doesn't use pwm for"
"brightness adjustment allowing you to"
"comfortably work for long periods of"
"time"
"unfortunately the battery life here was"
"underwhelming with less than seven hours"
"of web browsing or about five hours of"
"video playback"
"it's not bad but we've seen better"
"on the other hand the hardware is pretty"
"capable with the top model featuring a"
"core"
"i71165g7 and an nvidia geforce mx450"
"we were only able to get a laptop with"
"the core i3115g4"
"however 11th generation core i3 is"
"comparable with 10th generation core i7"
"10510u"
"this is because of the efforts of both"
"intel and lenovo the thinkpad e14"
"generation 2 is equipped with a cooling"
"solution that enables the processor to"
"run at 3.6 gigahertz for more than 15"
"minutes straight"
"there is one thing that we didn't like"
"about the laptop and it is the battery"
"life"
"other than that we got a good impression"
"from the build quality and the keyboard"
"also it is a small powerhouse even if"
"you pick the most affordable option with"
"the core i3 processor"
"in addition to that the upgrade options"
"are good and the display is fine enough"
"for business purposes"
"if you'd like to find more information"
"about this machine you can see all of"
"the tests we've performed in our"
"in-depth review"
"link in the video description below"
"[Music]"
"you"
"good everyone be asian dad here we're"
"going to do the in-depth review of this"
"lenovo thinkpad e14 gen 2. now this one"
"i've got here is the amd version and it"
"is a 14 inch business class laptop now"
"being part of the thinkpad series it's"
"made to be quite durable which is great"
"and being the e series is the entry"
"model to the business class laptops but"
"then you'll find out this entry model is"
"not that entry at all i actually find it"
"really good but more on that later what"
"we'll do is we'll have a little bit of a"
"peek of the internals a little bit later"
"in the video so stick around for that"
"and we'll also look at the temperatures"
"and fan noise of this computer as well"
"as its features as well now i will be"
"putting timestamps along this video so"
"you can actually skip to the different"
"sections that you might be interested in"
"let's have a look at the ports starting"
"on the left hand side of the computer"
"we've got the usbc port which is usb 3.2"
"gen2 now this supports power delivery so"
"that's where you actually plug in the"
"power adapter and you also plug in"
"docking stations as well"
"and then we've got the usb type a port"
"that's usb 3.2 gen1 and the supports"
"power sharing as well and then we've got"
"the hmi port which is version 1.4 and"
"then we've got the headphone jack"
"looking on the right hand side we've got"
"the security lock slot and then we've"
"got the rj45 and that's on the lever"
"system here and then we've got the usb"
"type a port which is usb 3.2 gen1 port"
"what this computer can be configured"
"with now this is the amd version so we"
"just go through the amd processor so it"
"can be configured with either the ryzen"
"3 which runs off four cores or the ryzen"
"5 which this one is and that is six"
"cores and there's also the ryzen 7 as"
"well which runs off eight cores now as"
"for ram rise it can go up to a maximum"
"capacity of 24 gigs of ram so you can go"
"up to eight gigs soldered to the system"
"board and then there's a dimm slot for"
"16 gigs now my advice is for the ram is"
"to if you really do"
"do a bit of 3d graphics is to make sure"
"you've got dual channel so you get half"
"of it on the system board and the other"
"half on the dim slot and you will find"
"the actual 3d graphics is greatly"
"improved nearly double the performance"
"so definitely look into that when you"
"get this computer configured with as for"
"storage wise it's got two slots for m.2"
"so you can put two ssd hard drives in"
"there and as for the graphics it's of"
"course using integrated graphics and"
"this one is the amd radon graphics and"
"don't be surprised it is actually pretty"
"decent and as for the display wise there"
"are actually two options for displays"
"for this one here and they both are full"
"hd options and of course there are no"
"touch as well and there are two"
"different panel types now the tn panel"
"type it is graded to 220 nits of"
"brightness and then there is a wva"
"version which is rated to 250 nits of"
"brightness which is what i've got right"
"here and we'll have a little bit"
"check on the display panel a little bit"
"later in the video and you'll find"
"there's a very interesting thing about"
"the display panel especially when it's"
"on battery the computer does come with a"
"720p webcam and there are two versions"
"of it this one here is just a normal"
"720p webcam and you'll see there's a"
"privacy shutter so it's just made a"
"little flick of a switch and you'll see"
"a physical shutter go over it and pretty"
"much it will just cover the webcam so if"
"it actually turns on"
"you can't really see anything which is"
"great the other version is the ir"
"version and that's really good for if"
"you're using windows hello this is a"
"recording from the 720p webcam from the"
"e14 now this is the video and audio and"
"edited so you can actually hear and see"
"what it looks like now i've actually got"
"two types of lights currently turned on"
"i've got one of my studio lights turned"
"on and i've also got my downloads from"
"this room which is the ambient light now"
"i'm going to turn off my studio light so"
"you can see what it looks like with just"
"the ambient light"
"and pretty much i've got two down lights"
"in front of me i've got two down lights"
"behind me and the two downloads in front"
"of me is quite far away so there's"
"actually not much light hitting my basic"
"mode so this is kind of like very dark"
"now in an office environment you"
"probably get a little bit better"
"lighting than what i've got at the"
"moment so this is kind of what it looks"
"like and i'll just turn my studio light"
"back on so you can see what it looks"
"like and of course with better lighting"
"better quality picture now i'd love to"
"hear what your thoughts are about this"
"webcam"
"love to hear what it is put a comment"
"below as for the keyboard it of course"
"houses the good old strong thinkpad"
"keyboard and if you've seen my previous"
"videos you know i love this keyboard a"
"lot it has very good tactile feel and"
"good key travel as well as this finish"
"of the each keys is quite smooth so"
"that's nice and it's got good spacing in"
"between as well so it's fantastic for"
"typing as well now it is quite"
"responsive even you just press it on the"
"side so you can see it's actually very"
"responsive to that as well now of course"
"they're in the middle it's still the"
"track point or on the g spot and you've"
"got the three supporting buttons below"
"the space key and then we've got the"
"track pad here and again it is quite"
"smooth matte feel to it as well and"
"doesn't have any problems if you've got"
"moist hands as well for that and of"
"course it's hinge at the top so it's"
"only mechanical at the bottom here so"
"you can still depress it at the bottom"
"here now there is a fingerprint scanner"
"built into the power button and you can"
"see the pattern was quite nicely lit"
"with a nice little led glow so that's"
"kind of nice so it's not that crazy"
"distracting and also the keyboard is"
"backlit as well so that's just function"
"spacebar will activate the three"
"different modes off medium and high and"
"as for the build construction of this"
"computer here now the top of the display"
"the lid here is made of aluminium and as"
"for the bottom and the sides it is"
"pretty much plastic all the way through"
"but it is quite durable actually there's"
"not much flex there involved as well and"
"as for the keyboard it's actually quite"
"stiff here so definitely good good"
"construction here for sure you won't"
"have any problems with that as well and"
"it does take a bit of fingerprints"
"unfortunately for the whole entire thing"
"so it does take a bit of a fingerprints"
"but i think kyle will get used to that"
"for especially for black as well and as"
"for the palm rest you've got a nice"
"decent amount of palm rest and you're"
"not going to be overhanging on the wrist"
"too bad so i mean sorry the upper part"
"of your wrist so you actually there's"
"your type you actually find still quite"
"comfortable as well too so not really"
"overhanging there so definitely the"
"palm rest is a bit of a matte"
"sort of plastic feel to it it's actually"
"not too bad at all and you'll see in"
"temperature test it's not pad at all"
"there are two speakers located on bottom"
"front of the computer now when i"
"measured out the maximum volume of the"
"speakers it managed to measure at a peak"
"of 78.8"
"decibels so that's a bit quiet compared"
"to a lot of other business laptops so"
"you may find yourself a little bit"
"struggling when you're outdoors"
"listening to this order or if you're in"
"a cafe doing a presentation it may be a"
"little bit of a struggle there but i"
"think you'll still be able to do it fine"
"but you may find it's on a bit of a"
"quiet side of things but else it's"
"actually all right as for the sound"
"quality why is it"
"this one actually did surprise me it"
"actually is not bad at all especially as"
"a business laptop it has a bit of bass"
"the mids were there and as for the highs"
"it did unfortunately distort a little"
"bit when you had it on a maximum volume"
"but it was it was actually quite"
"balanced and had a pretty good acoustic"
"com surprising from two little small"
"speakers so not bad at all especially"
"this is an entry model this actually for"
"me was better than the t series for the"
"thinkpads so that's pretty good there"
"for the speakers the computer comes with"
"a 65 watt power adapter and is actually"
"quite small and it does actually charge"
"by the usbc cable now as for the battery"
"it houses a 45 watt hour battery and"
"it does support rapid charge and what"
"that means is it can charge from the"
"battery from zero to eighty percent"
"charge in one hour's time i did test out"
"the battery life of this ryzen 5 version"
"and i did it in the four different modes"
"now in best performance mode it managed"
"to get an hour and 40 minutes and in"
"better performance mode it managed to"
"get an hour and 50 minutes only a little"
"bit better and in better battery life"
"mode it managed to get seven hours"
"and in battery saving mode it managed to"
"get 9 hours and 15 minutes and in media"
"mode i had wi-fi on and streaming"
"youtube videos and had the screen"
"brightness at 50 as well as the speakers"
"at 50 percent and it managed to get"
"eight hours and 15 minutes as of time of"
"recording this video when i actually"
"performed the testers i did found an"
"issue and i thought i might just give"
"you a heads up on this and that is when"
"i this computer goes into hibernation"
"mode it actually won't be able to wake"
"it itself up it seems to have an issue"
"with that so you might need to actually"
"turn off the hibernation of this"
"computer and i have reported to lenovo"
"hopefully they'll actually"
"put a bias update and then we'll"
"actually have that fixed so hopefully"
"i'll come out soon but just for those"
"who are actually purchasing very soon or"
"now uh you might actually want to turn"
"off that hibernation feature which is"
"basically deep sleep um you might"
"actually find that very have issues"
"trying itself waking itself up and if"
"you do pretty much just hold down the"
"power key into about five or ten seconds"
"it will actually completely kill off and"
"then you can start it up again i just"
"want to give you a heads up on that"
"that's all the weight of the lenovo"
"thinkpad e14 gen 2 is"
"1.58 kilos add in the 65 watt power"
"adapter becomes a total weight of"
"1.95 kilos"
"when i tested out the temperatures and"
"fan noise of this computer when i put"
"this computer on load i found most of"
"the hottest area of the computer is"
"located near the center of the keyboard"
"sitting around with the y key and also"
"on the top right of the computer as well"
"around about where the home key is and"
"that's unsurprising that's where the"
"exhaust fence is now from my unboxing"
"video i saw the other vent on the left"
"hand side of the computer and that was"
"the inlet vent so it is pretty much"
"where it starts to suck in the air so"
"you'll find also in the measurement it's"
"not as hot there as well but as the"
"center of the keyboard you'll find even"
"then it's not that crazy hot so it was"
"actually quite hard to actually"
"differentiate which ones was going to be"
"the hottest area now when i performed"
"the measurements my ambient temperature"
"was 22 degrees celsius and i took my"
"base measurement when the computer is on"
"idle and the hottest area of the"
"keyboard measured in at 31 degrees"
"celsius and the fan noise was 31"
"decibels so that's pretty much quiet and"
"that's pretty much cold as well and then"
"i put the computer on 20 percent load"
"and again the hottest area of the"
"keyboard measured in a peak of 31"
"degrees celsius and the fan noise was"
"still at 31 decibels so pretty much it"
"hasn't really done very much at all so"
"it still kept itself quiet which is"
"great and then i put the computer on 50"
"load and the hottest area of the"
"keyboard measured in at 37 degrees"
"celsius and as for the fan noise and"
"measured in a maximum of 32 decibels so"
"still quite quiet but it's spun up a"
"little bit it's quite quiet still and as"
"for the temperature you don't really"
"feel that much and then i put the"
"computer on a hundred percent load and"
"the hottest area of the keyboard"
"measured in at"
"42.5 degrees celsius and the fan noise"
"measured in a maximum of 33 decibels so"
"still quite quiet surprisingly and then"
"i also measured the bottom back cover of"
"the computer and the hottest area"
"measured in at 41 degrees celsius but"
"most of the areas was around about"
"hottest areas about 40 degrees celsius"
"and of course the fan noise was 33"
"decibels so as you can see this computer"
"is not hot at all even on most of the"
"time when you're doing average juice up"
"to 50 it's not that hot neither at all"
"you can and even 100 you can quite"
"happily put your hand down you feel a"
"little warm and that's about it it's not"
"that hot at all it's not burning hot"
"this for once is a very very cool"
"computer when you're actually working on"
"even though at measuring at 41 degrees"
"celsius you can probably put this on"
"your lap but i still wouldn't advise you"
"to put this on the lap but you probably"
"couldn't wouldn't feel too"
"distressed from it it will feel a little"
"bit warm but not too distressed where it"
"actually will be burning you so that's a"
"bit of a surprise how well the"
"temperatures are on this ryzen 5 version"
"of this computer i am very impressed by"
"that let's have a look at the internals"
"first off you need to unscrew the seven"
"screws that's holding the back cover in"
"after that you need a tool to pry this"
"thing open now this is not an easy job"
"this one i'm just using my daughter's"
"play-doh sculpture tool seems to work"
"very well for this hopefully later on"
"i'll upgrade it but my advice is to"
"actually come bring from the corners and"
"then go slowly slice it down to on the"
"front and then on the corner slowly"
"slice it through the sides as well and"
"then just repeat this again from the"
"other side so slowly from the corner"
"slowly slice it from the front and"
"slowly slice it from the back and then"
"after you should be able to lift this"
"open now i've actually pre undone this"
"to speed up some time and"
"this is what the internals kind of look"
"like now"
"we can straight away see we've got the"
"45 watt hour battery and to actually"
"undo the battery it's held in by"
"five screws here and this is the little"
"tab you can pretty much"
"pull it down"
"and then you should be able to lift this"
"thing up so that's kind of what you see"
"then we've got the coin battery right"
"here but you don't need to actually undo"
"that you can pretty much undo it from"
"here if need be so i'll just put this"
"one back in here place here"
"and"
"straight away this is the first slot of"
"ssd hard drive here so m.2 and then this"
"there is the second ssd hard drive which"
"is the other m.2 that so you got two to"
"actually work off because this one's"
"only for the smaller ones and this one's"
"for the larger ones here and then we've"
"got the wi-fi card here and right"
"underneath this heat shield"
"is i'm just pry it open ready and is"
"where the sol dim slot is for the ram"
"upgrades that's pretty much all there is"
"to internals as the display panel is a"
"16 by 9 aspect ratio and as for the"
"finish of the display panel it is an"
"anti-glare"
"feel to the display panel so it's not a"
"glossy one it's one of those matte feel"
"as for the bezel wise you'll see it's"
"actually i would say medium narrow it's"
"not crazy narrow all the way through but"
"it is nice and narrow in the sides and"
"as from the top and bottom it's decently"
"narrow enough but it's not like super"
"thick neither and it's not super thin"
"like some of the other"
"computers around testing out the color"
"gamut coverage or the full hd 250 nit"
"display it measured in at"
"56.4 percent srgb coverage and 39"
"adobe rgb coverage and 40"
"dci p3 coverage"
"i found a very interesting thing while i"
"was testing out the brightness of the"
"display panel and that is when this"
"computer is on battery it will limit the"
"brightness of the display panel now at"
"the moment it's running on battery and"
"i've got it at its maximum brightness"
"and it is only going up to a maximum of"
"88 candidates per square meter which is"
"88 nits of brightness now just to show"
"you it's actually reading from that i'm"
"just going to pull this off so you can"
"see that current change and i'll just"
"put it back on so"
"it's"
"just slowly put that back on properly"
"and it's going to read around about 88"
"to 89 handler per screen area so when i"
"plug the power back in and you'll see"
"i'm not going to change any things at"
"all i'm just going to plug it back in"
"and you'll slowly see this will"
"automatically ram itself back up to its"
"rated knitted rice now this one's rated"
"to 250 nits of brightness as you can see"
"this just slowly bring itself up to the"
"brightness"
"for it and you'll go past hopefully"
"about 250 i know it's gone past 250 it's"
"up to 276"
"candles per screen or 275 candidate per"
"screen which is a 275 digit brown so"
"i've got an extra 25 nits of bronze"
"fantastic"
"but"
"it will be on power and then once i just"
"take this off power to pull the power"
"cable and you'll see it actually"
"automatically ramp itself back down to"
"88 nits of brightness at its maximum"
"i've shined lights over it just to see"
"if there's any sort of"
"thing to do with ambient light but no it"
"doesn't really change that maximum"
"looking goal on battery is 88 knits or"
"89 nits of brightness so this is a bit"
"of a worry when you're actually out and"
"about and especially in daylight"
"it won't be a very bright screen at all"
"so hopefully we'll find some"
"information from lenovo to see if we can"
"actually get this thing changed i did"
"perform the benchmarks for this"
"particular computer here now this one is"
"configured with a ryzen 5 4 500 u"
"processor with 8 gigs of ram and 250 gig"
"ssd hard drive and here are the pass"
"mark scores"
"3d mark"
"pc mark 10"
"crystal disk mark"
"geekbench"
"and matlab 2020b"
"inspect view prep"
"this computer i have been very impressed"
"by especially how cool this runs as well"
"how quiet it runs and it's got very good"
"performance as well and especially for"
"the price is amazing so and the build"
"construction is great very durable"
"computer here i can easily recommend"
"this lenovo thinkpad"
"e14 gen 2 amd version it's really really"
"good computer especially i am pretty"
"blown by this in a way"
"if you find this video informative"
"enjoyed it or even just to support my"
"channel"
"hit that like button for me and if you"
"haven't already subscribe to my channel"
"but hit that subscribe button as well i"
"do try upload a new video every week and"
"just remember imperfections in life"
"makes it beautiful and interesting i'll"
"see you next video"
"that is"
"[Music]"
"what"
"you are going to live life"
"today is an exciting day you know that"
"i'm interested in finding the optimal"
"the ultimate laptop for myself it has"
"changed so much over the years at some"
"point i kind of zeroed in i targeted my"
"focus on think pad products because i"
"like a nice and substantial keyboard but"
"i don't want a super heavy"
"fat laptop that would typically be what"
"would include a nice keyboard i had the"
"x1 carbon many generations the x1"
"extreme today"
"i have in front of me the latest"
"innovation in the thinkpad lineup this"
"is the lightest"
"thinkpad they have ever done it is 1.99"
"pounds"
"it's a type of thinkpad it's the type of"
"laptop that's going to encourage you to"
"move it around just because it is so"
"light they've also used materials here"
"to give it a certain amount of"
"durability there's carbon in here i'm"
"hoping the keyboard feels as good as the"
"previous ones have it's also got"
"thunderbolt on it which you guys know"
"how i feel about thunderbolt"
"specifically thunderbolt 4 the latest"
"generation intel chips are inside of it"
"depending on how you configure it and"
"supposedly it's got over 17 hours of"
"battery life it is the x1"
"nano lots of exciting things"
"i don't know what it says on the box it"
"doesn't even it's so new so recently"
"launched this could very well be my next"
"laptop my next go-to"
"let me pull it out"
"oh that is tiny this is a oh my even"
"with the foam on it"
"holy"
"wow"
"what it feels like nothing it feels like"
"i'm holding an ipad but i'm holding a"
"whole entire"
"windows laptop that is incredible"
"all right i don't want to give it all"
"away i'm going to just look at the other"
"items in the box i'm going to lay that"
"down for a quick moment"
"it's pretty bare bones"
"so as mentioned it's a 65 watt power"
"brick you can use the type c power brick"
"from lenovo that's included in the box"
"but"
"it's a usbc"
"chargeable laptop so if you have one of"
"those fast charge power bricks that"
"maybe you use with your phone"
"one of those gan chargers you could use"
"that as well and get something even"
"tinier than this although the included"
"charger is pretty tiny as well in here"
"let's look around the device over here"
"on the side you see those"
"two thunderbolt 4 ports that i mentioned"
"and a headphone jack that's actually all"
"you're going to get as far as the"
"interfacing is concerned bit of a"
"drawback compared to the other models"
"but a consequence of getting that almost"
"impossible size here at 1.9 let me put"
"this in perspective for you"
"1.99 pounds the regular x1 carbon which"
"is already ultra portable is 2.4 pounds"
"the competing product from dell is"
"around 2.6 pounds it's almost a half"
"pound lighter than everything it's"
"competing with it's obviously lighter"
"than the macbook equivalent it's just"
"it's pretty crazy it's pretty wild you"
"can tell that i'm pumped up apparently"
"they worked on the audio as well which"
"is a big consideration for me i i can't"
"stand the tinny audio on certain laptops"
"let me open this up wow"
"just like all the other think pads an"
"incredible range on the hinge which you"
"look at that it can basically fold flat"
"you have of course a little cover for"
"the front-facing camera which is nice"
"from a privacy perspective more speaker"
"grills up here a large precision track"
"pad fingerprint unlock plus the"
"mechanical buttons which are a nice"
"little extra to have i usually map them"
"to just be"
"extra buttons as opposed to necessarily"
"having them left right"
"center button and of course you gotta"
"have the little"
"you gotta what is the name of this nub"
"you gotta have your nub all right"
"because it's a thinkpad after all that"
"is"
"that's like a cutting board it's so"
"thin and light"
"my goodness let me tickle these keys"
"just a touch"
"and yes"
"the quick brown fox is alive and well"
"the way they shape the keys now this"
"one's a little bit smaller than what i'm"
"used to on x1 carbon but barely"
"[Applause]"
"you are going to live life with this"
"keyboard and no moment in time would you"
"be sitting there saying i gotta get my"
"full-size keyboard out because"
"this it really tricks your brain"
"you're still getting key travel which is"
"so unusual on laptops in 2020 you just"
"feel right at home when you use a"
"keyboard like this one of course you"
"also have this really stealth like"
"design"
"matte black finish which is almost has"
"like a rubberized feel to it plus some"
"call features in the quick settings up"
"along top that's because you can"
"configure this model with 5g as well and"
"be completely off the grid or away from"
"wi-fi but still connected let me go"
"ahead and power this up the power switch"
"is over on the side"
"wow"
"that was nintendo like on the startup"
"11th generation up to core i7 processors"
"windows 10 pro obviously intel iris"
"graphics so integrated graphics you can"
"configure the display for touch or"
"non-touch they're both dolby vision"
"whether you go with the touch screen or"
"the non-touch screen and 450 nits of"
"brightness which i track this stuff i"
"like to use a laptop next to the window"
"so i care about the brightness level"
"450 is on the higher end of the spectrum"
"certainly especially for such a thin"
"display with such a tiny little bezel"
"you can get up to 16 gigs of memory on"
"here up to one terabyte of pcie ssd"
"storage has mentioned up to"
"17.3 hours of battery life that's very"
"specific lenovo 17.3 very interested in"
"the dolby atmos speaker system can they"
"deliver on a package that's so thin and"
"light can you really fit speakers in"
"there if they're half decent i'll be"
"okay with it in exchange for the"
"portability wi-fi six is built in and as"
"mentioned 5g as well"
"uh for connection via sim card i suppose"
"maybe it has an e sim because i don't"
"see a sim"
"tray over there"
"[Music]"
"all right so we are booted up it is a"
"matte finish on the display let me get"
"those knits going sometimes with a matte"
"display you don't really fully"
"appreciate how bright it is because it"
"doesn't have that extra punch that some"
"gloss gives you"
"however what you do get is"
"a sort of more uniform experience"
"because you have less reflections"
"i'm a fan of a matte display i'll take a"
"matte display no problem on the top lid"
"here there are four separate microphones"
"they took the video conferencing"
"potential very seriously obviously"
"they're targeting a work clientele and"
"another nice little touch on the"
"thinkpad logo over here we have the red"
"light indicating that it's turned on"
"above the eye inside of the logo"
"now what's unique about this laptop is"
"that"
"even though it's a 13-inch laptop"
"because they went with a 16 by 10"
"display top of the screen is actually"
"the same height as a 16 by 9 14 inch"
"laptop so you're only losing some width"
"now for productivity tasks that's not"
"really a big deal"
"that audience tends to like a slightly"
"taller display because of the type of"
"content that you view like say websites"
"for example which are typically a little"
"taller than video"
"content that is the most aggravating"
"sound"
"in the world"
"and it always like crackles the speaker"
"a little bit"
"because they didn't tune it correctly"
"full resolution 4k playing will do has"
"his very own colorway of later case for"
"a later case this laptop is so light i"
"can hold it out here i can't tell you"
"for days quantities that are left"
"because so many of them you have uh four"
"separate speakers so you have speakers"
"here which are going to give you"
"uh sort of more detail for dialogue"
"firing into your left and right ear and"
"then for a little extra bass these two"
"guys are going to hit the table and"
"honestly for a 1.99 pound laptop"
"i'm going to take that sound i'm going"
"to say it right now this sounds better"
"than some laptops i've tested that are"
"quite a bit bigger so they did think"
"about sound and i appreciate that"
"because for a while lenovo wasn't all"
"that interested in delivering too much"
"sound to you because they thought okay"
"this is a work device take it easy you"
"don't have to be watching these videos"
"very loud but that feature mattered to"
"me so i believe they have kind of"
"rectified the situation on that front"
"with this laptop windows hello tons of"
"options for unlock i typically will have"
"a couple different ones enabled so the"
"fingerprint scanner is one but so is the"
"face unlock in windows hello that one is"
"super quick if i ever switch back to a"
"mac laptop i often miss that i'm gonna"
"go ahead and try the fingerprint on this"
"one here we go now lenovo has put the"
"fingerprint scanner in this position for"
"a while"
"and"
"it's looking for the scan"
"and you're in my favorite setup for"
"these is a is a dynamic one where i have"
"multiple options for unlock and then"
"just whichever one kicks in first i'll"
"just go if i hit enter and it happens to"
"see my face okay perfect if i'm kind of"
"off angle or something and i use the"
"fingerprint perfect i just like having"
"more than one option for unlock i use it"
"on a regular basis i'm curious about the"
"front-facing camera because video"
"conferencing has become such a huge part"
"of our lives in 2020"
"and this four microphone array so i'm"
"gonna go ahead and launch a front camera"
"recording so"
"here we are this is just the camera app"
"within windows oh it's got some sort of"
"a noise cancelling thing going on i can"
"tell it's dipping the ambient noise"
"in between words one of the reasons you"
"have these multi microphone arrays is"
"often for a sort of noise cancellation"
"functionality in order to determine"
"what frequency the background noise is"
"and to kind of attempt to get rid of it"
"we're going to be testing out the"
"microphones on the laptop as well as the"
"front-facing camera for video"
"conferencing purposes regardless of"
"which conferencing app you choose to use"
"you might be curious about how you're"
"going to come through on"
"this laptop if you happen to pick it up"
"so it's not the most tremendous"
"resolution i don't know what they list"
"it as it must be maybe 720p they don't"
"even list it on here oh it's an hd"
"camera with ir as well and think shutter"
"that's the thing that allows you to"
"cover it up with an actual mechanical"
"switch and cover uh it looks like 720p"
"to me so don't get your expectations too"
"high but it should work for your various"
"video conferencing and it's a it's a"
"good location you know some super thin"
"and light laptops i've had to move the"
"location of the front camera but"
"this is where it should be up on the top"
"of the display the quick brown"
"fox the"
"quick one of the things about a laptop"
"keyboard"
"is"
"it's not just the travel in the keys but"
"it's also whether or not the whole thing"
"flexes"
"as those keys travel downwards and often"
"when you're dealing with something so"
"lightweight it's tough for them to"
"figure out"
"a way in which to"
"deter"
"the chassis from"
"bending down"
"one of the ways that lenovo does it with"
"the thinkpad lineup is they use some"
"exotic materials like carbon and"
"magnesium and a variety of high-end"
"materials that are super lightweight but"
"also stiff and strong and so as you can"
"see even though this thing is not even"
"two pounds as i quick brown fox it"
"there's no i'm not completely i mean"
"there's a little bit of flex in there"
"but it's nothing substantial now you"
"also know that i'm a huge fan of"
"thunderbolt seeing as how with a thin"
"and light laptop sometimes it's not"
"going to be the most"
"overpowering thing from a graphics"
"performance perspective but when you"
"have thunderbolt 4"
"my goodness you got a lot of potential"
"expandability with tremendous throughput"
"you could get crazy and do some egpu"
"stuff if you wanted you could get crazy"
"and do some capture stuff if you wanted"
"so there's flexibility once you have"
"that port and believe it or not it's"
"kind of a tough port to find every time"
"on every laptop you might happen to be"
"looking at"
"this is way heavier all right i grabbed"
"some comparables because i this is just"
"it's so interesting to me"
"sort of what the ultimate computing"
"device is gonna be just in my life and"
"it's gonna be different for everyone"
"depending on what you do on the"
"day-to-day for me the day-to-day there's"
"email"
"there's of course i gotta get into slack"
"and see what everybody's talking about"
"there's some youtube there's a lot of"
"tagging different things and uploading"
"things i'm just interacting with a"
"keyboard a lot i need a nice screen and"
"i want something ultra portable and"
"relatively durable so now you know why"
"i'm such a fan of these things but for"
"some people that are in this market"
"they're going to cross shop it against"
"something like this which is a macbook"
"air but funny enough the macbook air"
"actually feels heavy next to this it's a"
"whole pound heavier how crazy is that"
"it's a 13 inch laptop it's a whole pound"
"heavier now granted it's different"
"materials this is using an aluminum body"
"so it kind of has a its very own"
"luxurious feel to it"
"and there's a much bigger bezel around"
"the display it's a glossy display the"
"keyboard is a totally different type of"
"setup as well bigger track pad they're"
"targeted maybe at different individuals"
"but i could imagine that cross shop and"
"in that case"
"if you're looking for an ultra portable"
"i have to imagine you're looking at that"
"weight if it's going to go in a backpack"
"if it's going to move around with you an"
"extra pound"
"it's uh"
"you know this is two-thirds the weight"
"of this it's quite substantial and then"
"the other crazy thing is once you get"
"into"
"an ipad setup this is a 12.9 inch ipad"
"pro with the keyboard attachment and"
"obviously this is a more versatile"
"device because i can"
"pull this off put it back on"
"and"
"have the magic keyboard attachment"
"to do my typing and touch screen and i"
"could have a pen with it as well but"
"it's kind of amazing how heavy this all"
"gets when you put it all together so the"
"ipad on its own"
"is 1.4 pound"
"this is 1.4 pounds this is 1.99 pounds"
"so"
"the difference between this and the"
"macbook air is a pound the difference"
"between these two items"
"is about half a pound point six pounds"
"put that in perspective"
"because you can't feel this"
"that's insane"
"imagine it's"
"slightly heavier than a 12.9 inch ipad"
"pro with an entire keyboard and then if"
"you want to attach the ipad pro to the"
"keyboard and have a all-in-one solution"
"for when you need to do some typing let"
"me see how much the magic keyboard ways"
"macbook air is 1290 grams and this"
"combined weight is 13.51"
"so"
"this package is more than a pound"
"heavier than this one and you end up"
"with a 13-inch display"
"a keyboard in this case you can also get"
"a touch display i realize they're very"
"different targeted differently this is"
"like sort of a mobile os with the"
"potential for pen input and so on"
"so it's going to depend on what type of"
"work you do but for me that's just"
"staggering"
"what they were able to pack in here"
"at this weight and i'm very excited to"
"use this more extensively you're going"
"to see it on my desk downstairs on the"
"loo later set and i'm going to be going"
"back and forth with this this will be"
"the daily and i'm gonna hardly notice"
"that i'm carrying it and also last thing"
"i just noticed there's the sim card tray"
"so yeah crazy 1.99 pound thinkpad x1"
"nano"
"look at this look a few of these two"
"this thing feels like a tank oh that's"
"ridiculous"
"oh my god i know i'm throwing this thing"
"i know it's crazy"
"yeah that's nuts"
"yeah you really feel like you want to"
"get up and move go to a different spot"
"go to the kitchen go to the especially"
"with that little charger"
"you could do anything you go anywhere"
"you can do anything"
"hello everyone and welcome back to"
"another episode of gizmo joe today we're"
"going to be"
"uh looking at a lenovo thinkpad e14 gen"
"3. now i know and i apologize that this"
"is a bit hard to see um i don't have my"
"standard tripod handy because i'm"
"visiting my parents in the states"
"so just bear with me but basically what"
"we're going to do today is we're going"
"to essentially upgrade the ram and put"
"another solid state drive in here so"
"basically"
"you can get this in a variety of"
"different configurations this is the amd"
"ryzen 5"
"but it only has 8 gigabytes of ram and"
"it's only got a 256 gigabyte solid state"
"drive on the inside now obviously you"
"can pay more to have 16 gigabytes or"
"whatever"
"but i chose not to do that because it"
"was"
"sort of expensive to do those upgrades"
"direct from lenovo and i said to myself"
"you know what i can"
"probably just upgrade that stuff myself"
"save myself a little bit of cash so"
"that's what we're going to do"
"we have an 8 gigabyte ram module"
"that's ddr4 obviously it's a sodium"
"because it's a laptop and we're going to"
"be installing that to bump up the ram"
"from 8 on the inside of this device to"
"16 total and then we're also going to be"
"taking this m.2 drive which is a one"
"terabyte micron drive and installing"
"that as well so we're going to leave the"
"256 in there but it's got a separate"
"slot somewhere around here"
"for"
"another solid state drive which is what"
"we're gonna do and we're gonna just use"
"that one for storage so what we need to"
"do is uh there are a bunch of screws"
"there's one here one here"
"and one here one here one here one here"
"one here"
"so it's about uh seven screws total and"
"we're gonna remove those screws and then"
"we're basically gonna pry this back"
"panel off now from what i understand and"
"from what i've seen sort of uh"
"you know red on reddit and forums and"
"whatnot is that there are sort of"
"latches that keep this back panel down"
"so even when you take the screws out it"
"wants to stay together"
"so you just have to take a little bit of"
"time to pry that off so that's what"
"we're going to do i'm going to grab a"
"screwdriver we're going to undo these"
"screws and we're going to try to peel"
"this back panel off and"
"hopefully it will be all right"
"okay so once you remove the seven screws"
"on the back panel what you're going to"
"want to do is you're going to want to"
"find"
"the little seam which is right here i"
"know it's really really hard to see"
"but basically what you're going to do is"
"you're going to basically pry this"
"corner up now i could get my fingernail"
"in there i don't have very long"
"fingernails but i could get it in there"
"and manage to pry it up and then what"
"you want to do is you want to carefully"
"work your way around just peeling that"
"back housing off of or the back plate"
"off of this sort of like housing here"
"going to be really really careful"
"because there are sort of plastic"
"latches on the inside here that will"
"catch so what i recommend is getting"
"yourself like a little plastic shim uh"
"and then using that to sort of pry it"
"open and just carefully work your way"
"around the entire unit and then the back"
"plate should just peel right off and"
"then we'll be able to do our upgrade"
"okay so now we have the back panel of"
"the thinkpad e14 gen 3 off now like i"
"said you have to be really really"
"careful because there are sort of like"
"clips that hold the back plate in place"
"just carefully work your way around find"
"a corner that kind of you can peel up"
"with your fingernail or something like"
"that get a bit of plastic and just work"
"your way around and eventually the back"
"plate will come off i will say though"
"that it is"
"tedious it does take a little while um"
"you know it does feel like you need to"
"force it a little bit but trust me if"
"you just keep uh working at it going"
"around it will eventually come off so"
"basically what we're looking at here"
"is right here is"
"the solid-state drive where the"
"operating system is stored like i said"
"mine's a 256 but right over here is"
"where we can install our"
"m.2"
"2280"
"drive so that's basically just going to"
"slot in right there and i'll do that in"
"a second but what i want to show you"
"first is under this sort of aluminum"
"heat shield here we can pry this up"
"because this is where the ram is so what"
"we're going to do is"
"we're going to essentially pull this off"
"and once i do i'll show you and we'll"
"install our new ram module okay so as i"
"mentioned before you basically take this"
"heat shield off you can it's it's not"
"screwed down or anything like that it's"
"just basically held down by"
"these little pins here you can just you"
"know if you can get your fingernail"
"underneath there it should pop right off"
"otherwise like i said you can use a"
"little bit of plastic to essentially pry"
"that up but as you can see there's eight"
"gigabytes uh soldered onto the"
"motherboard but we do have an empty slot"
"so that's what we're gonna do we're"
"going to grab 8 gigabytes of ddr4"
"ram this is 3200"
"megahertz which is exactly the same as"
"what's going on there so again you know"
"ryzens they benefit from more ram and"
"that's obviously best to have them sort"
"of in dual channel mode so hopefully"
"this will give us a nice little"
"performance boost now i have crucial"
"here i bought this off of amazon it was"
"pretty cheap i think it was only about"
"35 us bucks or something like that if i"
"can get it open i can show you how to"
"install this thing it's not terribly"
"difficult but basically we just take"
"this guy out"
"if i can get him out"
"and that's our little ram module and"
"what we're going to do is we're just"
"going to flip it around so obviously"
"it's asymmetric the pins here so you"
"can't put it in"
"you know one way or the other it only"
"goes in a particular way and basically"
"we're just going to slot it in right"
"there"
"make sure it's seated properly push down"
"and these two clips will snap in place"
"and that means that your ram is now"
"seated properly so what we've done is"
"we've taken an 8 gigabyte"
"to a 16 gigabyte and that should really"
"help with performance anyway let's move"
"over to the solid state drive"
"installation next okay so as i mentioned"
"before as you can see i've popped that"
"heat shield back on but as i said before"
"this is where our m.2 drive is going to"
"be so again this particular laptop it's"
"the e14 gen 3 comes with 256 gigabytes"
"uh pre-installed but what we're going to"
"do is we're going to expand that storage"
"space by popping in one of these guys"
"and that's just an m.2 drive and like i"
"said this one's a one terabyte it's a"
"micron"
"and yeah it will give us a decent amount"
"of space so if you've never installed"
"one of these before basically they kind"
"of look like a stick of gum or something"
"like that but you need to essentially"
"undo this screw here"
"which is what we're going to do right"
"now we're going to pop that out"
"pop that off to the side don't lose that"
"because we definitely need that screw"
"right and then what we're going to do is"
"we're going to take this guy and we are"
"just going to"
"slot him in right here"
"so press in firmly"
"it should see okay"
"and then that screw that we unscrewed"
"before we're going to pop it right back"
"because that's what's going to hold this"
"drive in place make sure it doesn't move"
"around"
"and if i can screw it in"
"and there you go so it's seated properly"
"it's not going anywhere now what we're"
"going to do is we're going to put that"
"back"
"panel back on and then fire this guy up"
"and we can format our drive and we're"
"going to double check and make sure that"
"you know it's reading the 16 gigabytes"
"of"
"ram as opposed to eight anyway stay"
"tuned"
"okay so i fired up my laptop it turned"
"on so that's a good sign and i know it's"
"a little hard to see but basically you"
"can see here in the about section of"
"with the windows settings is that"
"obviously it's recognizing that i have"
"an amd ryzen 5 5500u with the radeon"
"graphics and we now have 16 gigabytes of"
"ram it says 4.8 of that is usable that's"
"pretty typical"
"so obviously it is recognizing that ram"
"module and we're good to go now what"
"we're going to do next is just check and"
"see if it's recognizing that other"
"1 terabyte drive and so as i said before"
"my c drive that's where the windows"
"installation is and basically"
"we have if i hit properties here we're"
"looking at a 237 so again like a 256"
"gigabyte solid state drive"
"i've used about 70 gigs i've got 166"
"left over now that one terabyte drive"
"that i put in was actually from another"
"laptop so it also had another"
"build of windows on there which i'm"
"going to wipe out and just totally clear"
"off"
"but for right now as you can see it's"
"showing as the d drive the other"
"solid state drive that we just installed"
"and as you can see here it's a one"
"terabyte so we're looking at 931"
"gigabytes so again everything has"
"gone smoothly"
"all you need to do is just take your"
"time peeling that back panel off and you"
"should be good to go you can upgrade"
"your ram and you can pop in more storage"
"to put"
"the back panel back on just you know"
"again set it on and then just snap it"
"closed"
"and then put those screws back in and"
"you should be ready to roll anyway"
"hopefully this is uh going to help you"
"guys uh with your own upgrades on your"

"thank you for watching if you like this"

"[Music]"
"you"
"hi there i'm guessing that you like i"
"was is currently searching for a new"
"laptop to use either"
"work in school or maybe at home"
"i was scrolling through the different"
"manufacturer's sites and i was mainly"
"looking for a quite powerful laptop that"
"could last me a good three years"
"while not being too expensive so i found"
"the likes of the ideapad 14 with amd"
"the hp envy x360"
"and yeah the idea pat it's great but"
"it's more focused on home use"
"the envy meanwhile was more expensive"
"and the version i was looking for in"
"particular"
"was currently out of stock so when i"
"spotted this"
"thing pad with a competitive price tag"
"and top level specs"
"i was sold so now i welcome you to this"
"casual review"
"the brand new lenovo thinkpad e14 with"
"amd"
"ryzen 4000 and make no mistake"
"this is not just another variation of"
"the intel model"
"but a completely new version the"
"thinkpad e14"
"generation 2. so it now comes with"
"support for dual channel memory"
"a backless keyboard although optional"
"for some markets"
"and a second m.2 slot instead of the"
"rather space"
"eating 2.5 inch cage from before"
"so that sounds like some steps in the"
"right direction"
"but before we get into it we've got to"
"unbox the damn thing"
"all right let's talk build quality"
"so it's the cheapest thing pad and that"
"immediately comes with some downsides"
"but in my opinion there isn't a lot that"
"i can truly complain"
"about with this device it's made out of"
"aluminium"
"and abs plastic so it feels solid"
"but with the hinge you want to make sure"
"you got both hands available"
"because you can't open this laptop with"
"one hand and holding a camera at the"
"same time"
"well it requires three hands so"
"this thinkpad e14 gen 2 packs the 8 core"
"ryzen 7 with integrated graphics in you"
"the screen has very small bezels all"
"around"
"while the top and bottom one are"
"slightly chunkier"
"the reason being that up top we've got"
"the web camera with ir which allows for"
"windows hello"
"then there's the beloved thinkpad"
"keyboard which still feels amazing to"
"type on"
"the trackpad is unfortunately not very"
"good though by today's standard status"
"okay so now we're going to know the"
"laptop a bit with some first impressions"
"but to really get to know it we need to"
"dive deeper"
"[Music]"
"let's start with going over the"
"internals"
"so we're rocking the amd ryzen 7 4700u"
"processor with integrated graphics that"
"means"
"eight cores eight threads two gigahertz"
"base clock"
"up to 4.1 gigahertz max boost clock"
"which is quite impressive"
"we got 8 gigs of ram it's ddr4 and is"
"running at 3200 megahertz"
"we've also got one empty sodium slot so"
"you can have up to 24 gigs"
"of ram in dual channel storage wise"
"we have the first hard drive which is a"
"512 gig"
"pcie m.2 plus we've got an empty m.2"
"slot if you want to expand"
"the battery is a 45 watt hour"
"so it's decent size charged at 65 watts"
"which allows for 80 in just"
"one hour via usb-c"
"the claimed battery life is 10.7 hours"
"so i would expect some around six or"
"seven and all of this is running on"
"windows 10 pro so that's"
"nice and to top it off we've got the"
"display"
"so this one is a 14 inch"
"full hd ips"
"with anti-glare and a brightness of"
"250 nits which is"
"honestly not that great but"
"it works fine for me in terms of"
"ports we've got one usb 3.2"
"type-c generation one with the function"
"of"
"power delivery and displayport 1.2"
"we've also got one usb 3.2 gen1"
"it's always on and an hdmi 1.4"
"b"
"and then a combined headphone and"
"microphone jack"
"on the other side we got one usb 2.0"
"a flippy down ethernet port and a"
"kensington lock"
"simple as that"
"let's move on to everyday usability"
"everyday tasks such as browsing reddit"
"and watching video"
"feel incredibly snappy thanks to the"
"high boost clock of a ryzen 7 processor"
"the display gets both bright and dim"
"enough for most environments"
"except for maybe being outside in direct"
"sunlight"
"if you feel the urge to furiously type a"
"notepad"
"or maybe not but perhaps compose a"
"document in word or google docs"
"then i can happily report that this"
"keyboard still"
"is the best on the market for long"
"typing session"
"and then there's the webcam and"
"microphone"
"and they are"
"less than average and average"
"by today's standards is still terribly"
"low"
"so you won't be taking any"
"fancy meetings with this"
"setting up the laptop for the first time"
"was rather quick and simple"
"it was not running a recent version of"
"windows meaning"
"some updates were due but when those are"
"done"
"you're greeted by the lenovo wallpaper"
"and a pretty clean install"
"you've got the likes of lenovo vantage"
"and mcafee pre-installed"
"but not much more so basically good to"
"go"
"moving on to gaming even though this"
"laptop isn't made for gaming"
"the integrated graphics can handle"
"titles like league of legends"
"cs go and rocket league by pumping out"
"60 plus"
"fps medium to high settings"
"in league of legends i managed an"
"impressive"
"87 fps on pretty high settings"
"in cs go it was also very playable"
"not as high but still mentioning"
"over 70 fps at 79"
"so nearly 80. and in rocket league"
"well it's a bit more demanding but"
"still very playable at its"
"56 fps"
"[Music]"
"in cinebench we can see that the 8 core"
"ryzen 7"
"beats out even desktop cpus from not"
"that long ago"
"which is impressive the only place we"
"haven't looked is"
"inside it's that easy to get open just a"
"couple of screws to undo"
"inside you can see the second m.2 slot"
"which is the full size one"
"under here we got the sodium slot and"
"what keeps it cool is the two heat pipes"
"compared to the intel versions one"
"and for me it hasn't got uncomfortably"
"hot even under low"
"so now let's get this thing back in one"
"piece and wrap up this review"
"[Applause]"
"to end it all i want to talk about is"
"this laptop the one for you"
"well if you want a powerful well-built"
"machine with an a-plus keyboard then"
"yeah this is for you"
"you would honestly be hard-pressed to"
"find another laptop with"
"zero big compromises this does it all"
"pretty well and i see no real reason"
"to go for the thinkpad t-series over"
"this"
"neither the ideapad 5 maybe the nvx360"
"if you value the screen a lot"
"but otherwise for this price it's"
"incredibly good"
"and has my full recommendation well done"
"lenovo"
"and thank you so very much for watching"
"this review of the thinkpad e14"
"don't forget to hit that like and"
"subscribe if you enjoyed watching this"
"and it helped you out stay safe and i'll"
