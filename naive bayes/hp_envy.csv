It is fast and beautiful.
I love the 360 touch screen, the loud speakers, and the feel of the keyboard.  However, the picture on Amazon was incorrect (Item pic shows a keyboard which includes a10-key pad).  Instead of notifying me that the computer is no longer available, the third party vender sent me (with no explanatory paperwork) a later model, upgraded computer than the one I ordered (w/o the10-key)!  Great computer, but the extra work, time & energy  involved in figuring everything out was enormous.
I was in desperate need of a new laptop. Right off the top my previous laptop was slow and it wasn't powerful enough to support an active lifestyle. I researched a few laptops but with all the recent life changes(all of which I hope end soon), I had to set a budget. Setting a budget meant that I wanted a serious laptop but wasn't going to go out of the $1100 price range. Well I picked this beauty. Right off the top this laptop looks nice; both appearance and screen view. This model comes with an Intel Core i7, a full HD touchscreen and a SSD for a very good start up. I like the overall look and feel of this laptop. It is a 2 In 1 but I will keep it in laptop mode as opposed to the other configurations. Its too early to do a full blown review but I am satisfied with my purchase and I do feel it will be good in being future ready.
Edit 11-10-2020: after $500 worth of computer repairs part of the problem is HP decided to put 2 different size RAM cards in it, 2gig and 4gig. When I put MS suite, Acrobat DC and Trend Micro Security it overloaded it. No heavy use simple Word docs, PDF, surfing and email. Tech at the shop said that is a bad setup, it puts an uneven load on the smaller card. Bad setup. But, with an extra $500 cash it can function like a normal computer (if there is such a thing anymore). See below original issue. In short these computers sit in storage and you get them, update them and with Windows massive updates and crashes this year be prepared for a month of chaos to clean up. Death to OneDrive as well....Unless you’re a computer nerd! ;) #dumpthebloatGreat computer but the bloatware and invasion of privacy by MS is horrible. Entry level computer, plan on taking straight to tech to have it cleaned. Drivers way outdated and had to spend $200 to get it working smooth. If you’re good with computers and can clean and update it’s a good buy. But unless you order direct with it pre-loaded with what you bought it’s a work in progress. One HUGE thing. Turn off OneDrive Immediately!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It’ll steal your whole computer all the files and suck it up Into MS cloud. Destroyed my system when I tried to disable.
Good laptop, gets the job done, wouldnt highly recommend for any heavily cpu/gpu taxing, fast paced games, but runs other casual less taxing games just fine.  Runs a bit hot; make sure you keep the airflow good around your laptop.  Overall great for work and school!  Switches tabs and windows and opens apps smooth as butter, i havent experienced any slowdown thus far even after upgrading to windows 11. Would recommend, hp makes some darn good laptops.
Nice purchase, a good upgrade for me. Comes with charger and hp pen + a type c cord to charge the pen. Fully charge the pen before use.
I’ve had this laptop going on 2 weeks now & I love it so far. I seen it in person at Best Buy and I researched to find best laptops for college students and this one came up multiple times. Since Best Buy was sold out for weeks I was glad to find it on Amazon for $100 cheaper and it also came in 2 days faster than expected. So far it’s been great for speed , not too heavy & my favorite part is switching it to tablet mode and being able to touch the screen in either mode. Very easy set up and beautiful design. The only drawbacks I have is the battery life is kind of short it’s about 4 hours , may very based on use (since I watch a lot of streaming services on it) and the internal fan could be a little quieter but doesn’t last very long. Other than those things this was well worth the money.
Great laptop with a lot of memory. I've been having problems with the bitlocker function, camera, and audio. Additionally, the backlight against the silver keyboard is incredibly challenging for me to use during the daytime, as I have a hard time seeing light against light.I tried to request a refund and/or exchange and seller said no.Making the best use of it and still is a great functional laptop/tablet on the go solution.
Just had it for a couple of days. Everything's flying - fast, fingerprint sign-in is a huge plus. Touchscreen is responsive to both finger snd styluses, sensitivity is just right on. Bought HP pen separately - works flawlessly. Optane memory seems to speed up tremendously the process of handling image and video files. Fan is very quiet, doesn't seem to overheat. Graphics are good for a full HD but nothing like on your latest smartphone. The build is solid, aluminum chassis so no cheap plastic feeling but weighs just a bit more which I don't mind.Haven't tried to play any games yet but Adobe PS and PPro work with heavy files without problem
Bought this for our son when he went off to college. He says he’s had no problems with it whatsoever and is very pleased
The functionality of this laptop has been good. Unfortunately, the battery life is TERRIBLE. With light use (Microsoft Office, some internet use), I get about three hours before I have to plug the machine into the charger. If the power is less than 50% when I put the machine to sleep of an evening, it is fully drained by morning.
I love this new laptop. It’s lightweight easy to fold to view as a small tv and the touchscreen feature is great for scrolling and moving around the screen. It’s nice that it has enough ports for my external devices. I can plug in an external hard drive, my new iPhone 11 Pro, mouse and thumb drive. With ease. Touchscreen Just needs to not recognize my palm when I want to draw but I decided to just draw with my mouse as the Surface Pen I bought gave me jagged pixelated lines.
Aesthetically, the computer is very pretty. For the most part, it works well. The touchscreen feature is very responsive and it works relatively fast.However, often the internet disconnects. What I mean by this is that although my internet itself works fine and everything else has an internet connection, the computer will claim that my internet has no connection. It works if I disconnect and reconnect but having to do that multiple times a day defeats the fact that I wanted to use this for online classes.Also, the computer has really loud fans. It seems like it has the tendency to heat from basic functions and will turn on the fans which are just... loud.If you care for camera quality, this one does not have great quality. So those zoom meetings are gonna look kinda fuzzy. Additionally, the speakers aren't super loud, especially if you turn it to the tablet form because then the speakers are behind you. I don't use my computer camera a lot or the speakers out loud, but I thought I should share.The computer itself is fine outside of the internet issue. If that wasn't an issue, then I would probably like this computer more.
I looked at MANY many options - for days.  I called friends.  I called tech support. I called relatives.  I even signed up for Consumer Reports so I could get the laptop reviews.  I spent hours on websites, including HP, Apple, Microsoft and others.  I finally landed on the HP Envy x360 and Amazon offered the best deal. The laptop has everything I needed and some great surprises.  I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this laptop.
The product I received had a lot of scratches on the outside.  There was no number pad.  The seal on the sleeve appeared to be open.
Great laptop. I would buy again. Oh wait I did buy it again. Love the fingertouch.
Excellent graphics; convenient everything.  Only 2 USB ports; wish it had more.  Still, it's excellent for what it is.I hate Windows 10, but it's that or Linux.I wanted the tent/touchscreen capability, but find it too limiting for my use; I doubt I'll use it.  Still, it's nice to have.
Purchased this laptop in 10/2020 and today 12/07/2020 I contacted HP support and they ran testing and discovered my battery needs to be replaced. I keep hearing this high pitched static noise coming out from under the keyboard. My laptop is aware of when the ac adapter is plugged in but will not add any charge. HP support was very helpful in assisting me send it in to be repaired but to have this issue just after 2 months... idk. I will update once I get the laptop back. I am a little concerned of the longevity of this product. Had a Mac I got back in 2013 that still works like a charm but I switched to Microsoft for school. On a better note, the touchscreen works very well and this computer has very fast download times. Love the look and feel of this computer. Who knows, maybe just got a rotten egg.

Very sleek design. Everything is very responsive and both the picture quality and brightness are excellent. The fan is effective but it's quite loud while running.
I love everything about this laptop, it  touch screen, and i no longer have to remember my login password because it has finger scanner.
It arrived in good condition and on time. Setting up was easy, voice-assisted. I am not sure about the battery life yet because I haven't had it long enough.
I have zero complaints on this laptop. I saved about $700 purchasing this through Amazon vs buying it at best buy. This helps me with all my business needs. Great quality and great features.
I have bought the laptop last year and i decided to write now a review because i am very satisficed with price i bought the feature the laptop have and so far so goodRecommended this product and the communication with seller.
Translate review to English
I ordered this computer for grad school and so far I really like it. The battery life is great and I’ve enjoyed the 2 in 1 features. I did have to reorder a second time because the first computer did not have functioning speakers. The second one arrived and worked perfectly and I received a full refund for the first one.
I like the touch screen
I have only had this computer a couple months, and I have to say I am sorely disappointed. Purchased 9/24, and it is now 11/19. My fan has been kicking on and the computer gets HOT, especially in the top left corner of the keyboard.  I have also had programs crash more than I would expect of a brand new laptop. I love the computer, just wish this wasn't happening. Now I fear I have to contact HP and hope for the best on a warranty return.Feature wise, I just wish it had 3 USB ports.Only does returns for 30 days.
Good performance
I got more than what i paid for. I paid for 16gb optane memory but got 32gb. The package also arrived a few days before time. Thank you barley8
Great laptop, very fast, nice bright touchscreen display.  I’m not a gamer and don’t do any video editing, but wanted a laptop that is powerful enough to easily last 5+ years.  Works great for office apps, web surfing, watching videos, playing music, simple picture editing - it is probably overkill for my needs.
Great upload time, probably best I have ever seen. Great at multi app and browser functionality, very fast. Thought the camera could be a bit better considering the price but all in all great purchase!
I’ve had to give this computer to HP twice now within the first year of owning it. Both times the screen just goes black and the computer won’t turn on. Had to replace the motherboard
Great laptop. Runs very fast.  After rigorous research to find a fast reliable laptop I’m 100% satisfied with this purchase.
I am excited about getting my new computer! So far it works beautifully.
Pretty fast and cute laptop. Serving good for my PLC programming and subsea controls systems applications. its really worth the cost.
Love the touch screen responsiveness and battery life is great!
Love this laptop!!!  Using it for school and web surfing!  Fast, great color, sleek and beautiful computer overall!

Purchased for son -he says it works great.
I am delighted with the size of the laptop!  However, the computer seems to have a 'lag time' and I often need to wait for it to "catch up" with me when I am working.  We have high speed internet, so that is not the problem.  My husband is an IT administrator and we cannot determine why this is happening.
Pretty fast. Easy to work with since  it's a touchscreen .
Very easy to set up and use
After about a year the touch screen stopped working so it couldnt be used as a tablet when needed.
Little heavy
Love it
I liked it so much.👍
Absolutely fantastic
It’s been a great computer for my child. It does everything she needs.
Excellent product
touchscreen is awesome.  super fast startup.  great overall.
Best Laptop I've purchased. Fast, solid quality, nothing to complain.
It is exactly what I ordered and works really well and fast.
The only concern i have is battery life. Fully charged battery dropped to 1% in 5 hours. I was just using microsoft office and email.
After  use of two weeks the first laptop would not turn on and today the second laptop will not turn on!! Really! Seems really fishy that both laptops can't make it a year..... Best advice, don't buy these from this seller!
The keyboard on the HP - Envy x360 2-in-1 15.6" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 512GB SSD + 32GB was significantly bowed up on the left side of the laptop. I'm sure that was an indicator of a much bigger problem with the laptop, so that is way I returned it.
First of all, none of the docking stations I bought worked with this computer, and the computer won't turn on after a month or so.  Does Amazon sell computers that were returned?  I purchased two laptops from Amazon, and each of them broke within less than a month or so.
It’s horrible and Amazon has not given me the opportunity to return it
The laptop is okay. But because of a bad update combined with HP automatically enabling bitlocker, all of my files have been lost.
Laptop would not connect to WiFi. Spent 40 minutes with HP technical support. Nothing worked. HP technical support told to use their advance tech support at additional cost to me. I return the laptop.
The laptop was amazing to look at however the keyboard didn't work straight out of the packaging
This computer is incredibly slow.  Much slower than the eight-year-old desktop it replaced.  I am very disappointed with this laptop.
Very expensive
I bought this laptop, HP - Envy x360 2-in-1 15.6" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i7 - 12GB Memory - 512GB SSD + 32GB Op, in July 2020. It immediately had a problem as it was hot with a very loud squeally fan. I called HP, and called HP, and called HP finally when I actually got a human and not their idiotic virtual assistant his only solution was to have me send the laptop back to their service dept. They quoted about 3 weeks turn around with repair, shipping etc. I told them this was unacceptable as I use this as my work computer and could not be with out this essential tool for my business as a self employed real estate broker. My old computer died and this is all had. Again, after many calls I finally got to what they called an escalation manager. He claimed he called me in an email to me but I had no call record of a missed call or a voice message. I emailed him back to call me but he never called me. Time is moving on as this is almost the end of august, and I got many hours of phone calls. I finally get a hold of him and told him I need another laptop immediately. He said their policy is I have to send in the old one first. I offer to pay for a new one and they can reimburse once they get my broken one, but they will not do that. I  ask for a loaner and they will not do that. Finally he offers to order a new fan and heat sink as he thinks that is the problem and he schedules a technician to install the parts at my house. I agree to that.  But tell him that seems like a very expensive solution they may not solve the problem but that is all he will do. A box from HP comes in mid October, almost 2 months after ordering, and a technician comes out to install it a few days after I receive it., he opens the box and discovers that only the fan was received, he installs that but the problem is still there. He calls in and orders the heat sink which I should have received before he arrived. He leaves, computer not fixed. Two weeks later I get and email that the part is delayed and will not get to me until 12/11/2020. I actually get the part on 12/19/2020. HP is supposed to call me to set up a time to install that. I never get a call and email the escalation manager. He does not get back to me. Yesterday, 01/14/2021 I call HP, get another support agent and have to go through the whole case history, Mind you I now have 4 separate case numbers and two case service numbers This agent can not help me and he gets another escalation manager on the line. The manager says the same exact thing, that i have to send in my computer for repair, again I explain I can not do that as stated above, I also told him that I am now having another problem, battery life is horrible. I told him I need another computer asap, he also can not do that and says he will pass this up the line to anther dept. He schedules a call today at 01/15/2021 11AM with the new dept. No call is received. I call the customer service number again, wait 45  minutes for some one to actually answered and hear their message repeated every few minutes, When he does answer and we go through the whole story again, he  tells me another escalation manager has been assigned and he will email me in 48 hoursSo it has been about 7 months since I bought this piece of garbage and still no customer service, no resolution, I am so frustrated and upset with HP as I had a lot of HP products in the past and they were great, and there customer service was also well know for excellence, Not anymore. Now all their calls go to India and they can not even resolve a very easy problem to fix and put me in this situation. Based on  customer service alone I will not buy another HP product .I guess the only thing I can say is that I do like the tough screen and the speed of the Corei7 processor, but I could have got that with another brand. My previous laptop was a Lenovo Yoga, and that was a great reliable laptop, never made a noise, worked great until windows 10 killed it with all their crazy updates and other issues that basically made it inoperable.If you do buy one of their products I do hope your experience is much better then mine
I bought the HP Envy and after the warranty period ended the hinge failed.  They have designed a flawed product.  The glass screen is too much for the plastic hinge they have installed to handle, and all sorts of folks found their hinges breaking everywhere from months to years down the road, depending on how much they opened and closed the lid.I used my laptop almost exclusively at my desk.  I wasn't opening and closing it much, which is probably why mine failed about 2 years in.  The warranty is only for one year.Upon researching the problem I discovered the flaw was HP's faulty design, putting too much weight onto a flimsy plastic hinge.  It is all over the HP discussion boards.  What is also all over the boards are people like me who began the long and unfruitful process of trying to get HP to stand behind their product.  I was given the run around for many weeks and finally gave up when it became evident they had been instructed to not help people with this problem.  They knew what they had done, but with money in mind, decided quite purposefully to not stand behind their product and fix it.  I was accused of dropping my laptop and having other issues wrong which I was trying to get fixed under the guise of complaining about a faulty hinge.  2 years later I sit at the very same laptop still using it because I couldn't afford to fix or replace it 2 years ago, trying to warn people about HP and HP envy in particular.  Nothing was wrong with my computer except the hinge broke because of their design having too heavy a screen for the hinge to support.  For two years I have rarely closed my lid.  I close it with great care the 3 or so times I have needed to do so.  Other than this I just use it at my desk.  I never dropped or otherwise abused the laptop.  I really like it except for the fact I can't take it anywhere or close the lid to protect it from dust.I have just bought a new laptop.  I haven't booted it up yet but will in a few days.  I bought an ASUS, one of Samsung's new latops.I will never purchase HP again.BEWARE.  HP WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DESIGN FLAW WHICH CAUSED THE FAILURE OF MANY, MANY, MANY HINGES ON THESE AND OTHER HP LAPTOPS.Not good.  There are too many great competitors to treat your customers like this.
The computer is fine, as with HP stuff I've been buying since the '70's.  Memory is quick but small for my needs.The problem, as of November, is that static which is to weak for my fingers to feel is still enough to shut the thing down.  I now have it wrapped in aluminum foil.I have read that (since 2015) the solution is to send it back to HP for an internal insulation fix.  No thanks; my next computer will be some other brand.
I didn't expect it to be as fast as it is. From shutdown, it is ready to go faster than my old dell inspiron 15 with intel I3 and 16GB of ram. Very happy and would recommend. Is just a little heavy due to the metal casing, but that is a plus as well.
i am looking for a charger to replace it would any 65w charger do?
I should have believed all the reviews I read about this laptop's cooling fan making a horrible noise.  The loud pitch the fan makes is unbearable, and frankly a total rip off for the money you are going to dish out.  HP should have fixed this issue when the problems first surfaced.  Now, I am stuck with an expensive noisy laptop.  DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP.  You will regret it.
An impressive machine, until it's not. I've tried a dozen ways to get it working again. Hardware supposedly checks out. Won't be fixed, won't repair install, won't Reset. All I have left is a clean install. Hopefully that will work.Probably Microsoft's fault, but the manufactures should demand more from Redmond. Linux is the better way to go if you don't need proprietary programs.
I am using it to write this review right now. It came about an hour ago (on the earliest shipping date) and I've been using it for school for about 30 minutes! It comes almost dead so you're gonna wanna plug it in before starting to set it up.
Product looks nice and it's fast

Last year, we got our hands on the AMD version of the Envy x360 15. It happened to have one of the best displays when it comes to color-related work. Undoubtedly, this has set expectations for the laptop we’re going to test today – the Envy x360 15 (15-es1000).	Last year, we got our hands on the AMD version of the Envy x360 15.

Before we start, we would like to talk about an issue we had with the Envy x360 13 (13-ay1000). Its fan seemed to be suffocating because of the thin rubber feet, hence short clearance from the surface you place the laptop on. Given the similarity in the design, we expect the same, so we’re going to check the temperature of this notebook both with and without a cooling pad.

Once more, HP has done a good job designing their laptop. It is made out of aluminum and weighs 1.82 kg, which is more than fine for a 15-incher. Also, it is relatively thin with a profile of 18.4mm. Its body is not very resistant to flex, but things are not as bad as with the 13-inch Envy x360. On the bright side, the lid shows enviable stiffness.

Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is an easy way to control monitor brightness. When you lower the brightness, the light intensity of the backlight is not lowered, but instead turned off and on by the electronics with a frequency indistinguishable to the human eye. In these light impulses, the light/no-light time ratio varies, while brightness remains unchanged, which is harmful to your eyes. You can read more about that in our .

In this test we use 100% on the CPU cores, monitoring their frequencies and chip temperature. The first column shows a computer’s reaction to a short load (2-10 seconds), the second column simulates a serious task (between 15 and 30 seconds), and the third column is a good indicator of how good the laptop is for long loads such as video rendering.

Interestingly, some iterations may come with a Pen inside the box, but we didn’t have one in the retail box we got. Thankfully, there are other input devices, which in this case are one of the good ones on the market. The keyboard is clicky, and has decent key travel, while the touchpad is super responsive and pretty accurate. It’s worth mentioning that there is a fingerprint reader, which pushes the right “Control” key out of contention.

While we are here, there are two more keyboard shortcuts we want to talk about. Firstly, the laptop has a privacy shutter, which is activated by the key next to the Power button. And then, there is a dedicated HP Command Center button. This software allows you to choose from some performance presets.

And here comes the issue with the CPU power we mentioned earlier. While the firmware allows the device to be pushed to 28W of sustained TDP, the cooling solution just can’t cope. Well, unless you add a cooling pad to the mix, where the larger breathing space for the fan pays dividends. Unfortunately, this seems to be a common issue for the Envy series, as we had exactly the same problem with the 13-inch Envy x360 we tested a few days ago. This can be addressed by introducing thicker rubber feet for next year, and we really hope HP does that. Because the Envy x360 15 (15-es1000) and its users deserve it!

The next thing in mind here is the battery. We got less than 7 hours of Web browsing or nearly 11 hours of video playback. While the latter is close to the result achieved by the AMD version of this very same laptop, the Web results seem odd.	The next thing in mind here is the battery.

The laptop is fantastic in terms of performance, the display. But I would still never recommend buying this laptop, because the hinges are way too delicate, and I have seen many people, include myself, face broken hinges within a year of use.
Wrong caption.. it’s not budget
Quality of HP laptops has really gone down...not at all satisfied after buying HP earlier I used HP for 10 years it was just amazing the quality of everything was amazing but new lap is crap
Watching the unboxing and review of tech products after you own them is a different kind of feeling altogether 😍 own this one... It is a very good laptop compared to hp spectre x360 which is much higher in price this envy gives pretty much every functionality that spectre offers

Khatarnak ❤️
Damn! how beautiful this woman is !!
😍
I just purchased this laptop for business school and was told by the store employee the fan would not be noisy. Upon opening the laptop and removing it from the box, the fan was very noticeable. Any tips on how to quiet the fan noise? I entered BIOS and hit the Quiet/Cool option for the fan but it was still whirring? Thanks in advance.
So tnx. I bought yesterday.😇

I should have read the reviews before buying 😩😔

Nicely done. Thx
If you look closely you can see a laptop in the video... 😍
I have a issue with kyboard backlit, it always turn off after 30 seconds, its so annoying how to make it permanent any suggestions pls I tried with BIOS settings but advanced option not there
Got everything I needed to know about the laptop and I’m really impressed
I would be happy in life with that beautiful piece. The laptop is good too. :)
It&#39;s one of the waste laptop mainly for students I faced a lot of issues I suggest not to buy this and the customer care will not give you any solution for this
Please let me know the ram is upgradable or not?
Isn&#39;t there a stylus with it?
Wow Pakistan nd Nepal has same dollar rate lol
Is it upgradable? And if yes, how many ram slots does it have?

This review really helped. Thank you so much Pratima for being crisp and precise!

Youre so beautiful 🤍
They were right. Nepali girls are really beautiful
Don&#39;t buy. Hardware n software issue. Hinges is bad n it faces black screen issues
Is hp pen also provided in the box?
is this the pale gold colour?
Great review. I am looking for a new device and found one of these in a black friday deal. I think you&#39;ve just sold it to me. Thanks
Is this laptop is good for graphic designing as well???
"Honestly, this Envy x360 is the worst laptop i&#39;ve had in all 7 of them. 
<br>It is getting super hot while playing anything, even low spec games. 
<br>Sometimes it is freezing for 1-2 sec and it gets back to normal afterwards.
<br>The cooler is SUPER noisy even while browsing, sometimes for no reason.
<br>And now, after ~8 months of usage, THE DISPLAY IS STARTING TO GET OUT OF IT&#39;S &quot;CASE&quot; for some reason. Have to mention i don&#39;t even move him from the desk.<br><br>
<br>
<br>I&#39;m still wondering what else could broke soon in this &quot;machine&quot;. At least it looks good, lol."

Please make a video of hp pavilion x360
why no mention of indian pricing ?...if you are doing us pricing
Your way of speaking is very nice. Nice voice with no hindrance in speech.
Balanced and precise review . Thank you
Looking so gorgeous
can you review the msi modern 14 with ryzen 5 4500u/4700u varieties???
Do this laptop comes with an amd model without 360 🙄 ??...<br><br>And, also can you review the msi modern 14 with ryzen 5 4500u/4700u varieties.
Hey Apple, take notes. Look at HP and Dell, no notch!
Candid review
I was close to buy it, but it doesn&#39;t support standard USB Type-C PD power supply. WHY?!?<br>I don&#39;t want to have another not standard PSU at home. I already have 5x Dell PSUs, 4x Lenovo and 1x MSI (however this MSI is a standard PSU without 3&#39;rd line to check the PSU vendor).
Hope HP has sorted out the issue with the hinge on Envy

very systematic and organised video review for a laptop . quite comprehensive. nice edits as well. thanks for saving time. 👍
An $850 laptop costs over 1.3 lac in Asia, what B.S. My currency conversion basicsa says HP &amp; all these US MNCs are ripping us Asians
Man it costs about 2 million in our country its soo much
Very comprehensive review.  This appears to be exactly what I am looking for.  Upgraded to 16GB RAM.
Can you play roblox/genshin impact on this?
Budget = 1.45 lakhs.<br>🥲👍🏻
i like how u said the price first
Is it best for video editing ?? Or can you suggest other best hp laptop for video editing??

Great review. Loved the shots from the angles. This is not the laptop, I&#39;m buying. Thanks for saving my time for extensive research 🙂
I bought this laptop.  It&#39;s been a nightmare.  I have had it for two months and the HP repairman has been to my house five times.  He replaced the SSD card, but that didn&#39;t work.  Then I waited for two weeks for them to order a &quot;part&quot;.  They replaced the part today, but now the screen won&#39;t turn on, so I have to wait for them to decide what to do.  I work on this laptop everyday, all day.  Buying this laptop was the worst mistake.  It&#39;s been a nightmare.  And HP does not care.


Dell Inspirion 5410 or Hp envy 360<br>Which one is bette
does the laptop have no hdmi port???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wei4UMSpNRM&amp;t=2m03s">2:03</a> the hinge at the right side looks crooked. Is it okay????
Thank you so much. Your review was very helpful for this budget laptop.

This is the worst laptop which i had seen.I use this laptop since 8 month.The trackpad of this laptop feels like cheap <a href="http://quality.in/">Quality.In</a> 5-6 month you need to change this trackpad and second things is there is lot of heating issue and that speaker is not so loud you can add you approx $133 or Rs 10000 and you can purchase macbook air which is <a href="http://fantastic.in/">fantastic.In</a> mac air it will run upto 1.5 day where hp envy about 6 7 hours which is really bad and not worth it.Where it can easily bend its aluminum body that is not  good and in back side of hp laptop there is rubber strip which peal off in few months and service centre could not repair that strip the strip is too much useful for grip of laptop on table .Whenever we compare mac air  and hp envy both have approx same price and mac always <a href="http://win.at/">win.At</a> last my opinion hp envy 13 x360 is not worth it please visit store and check all laptop in that range before buying.Hp is like MI😅.
why ac smart pin and no usbc port with thunderbolt?! ?!??!!? that laptop is bullshit.
Please make video on Dell XPS (2in 1 )

Hi, just tried a friends envy (ryzen 4500, 8 gb, 256 gb ssd), it gets very very hot during the initial charging phase(0 to 50%), not possible to use on lap during that time. Is it a common thing for this series or a exceptional laptop he should return. same with yours?<br><br>comments guys

Budget laptop with that price tag. Seriously?
I was looking for a laptop at this price range , and this was one of the options on my mind but then i saw many people report broken hinge after a year or so , so I suggest go for xps 13 instead. I was also looking at Surface laptop 3 but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s available in Nepal though.





Didn&#39;t u get the pen?

What is your opinion about Envy x360 i5 11th generation 13 inch laptop.

It&#39;s a bummer that both intel and AMD versions don&#39;t looks that good. It&#39;s subjective but I really like how silvery white laptops look. They hide fingerprints and scratches better too. <br><br>Hp envy 15 silver and hp spectre x360 silver (from older generations) look just perfect
Tara sutaria 😇
I am confused about HDMI port. Do we need Type C to HDMI or USB to HDMI cable for HDMI Functions? @Gadgetbyte
Price of hp envy 13 (non converting and non touch, if available) 11th gen in india?<br>512 gb storage variant only<br><br>Pl share the link if u know




I am afraid it does not exactly qualify to be a budget laptop



I just bought this laptop , But i did not expect the OLED screen to cause me this much eye strain. i cant see the flicker but it definitely hurts to look at the screen longer than a few minutes. <br><br>Really disappointed, I don&#39;t suggest anyone to buy this specific model.
Yo this review is good and I am planning to buy this same exact model but the only issue is that here in the<br>UAE, it is around 95 dollars more which is<br>going a little off budget for me<br>for a 13. 3 inch laptop... I will still keep<br>this laptop in mind....thanks for the  helpful review
1.45 lakh and such a crap.....don&#39;t try to scam other people with budget title
I bought hp envy 15
no point using intel in an ultra book these days

So now a $1000 laptop is considered a budget laptop??? WTF???? For that price I&#39;ll will go for a new M1 macbook air that cost $899 in the US
When are you gonna review Lenovo Legion 5 or 5i 2020?? It&#39;s the best one on Budget. Pls do it fast 🙏🙏🙏
Battery backup is very poor. Rest all good. I have taken pavilion model iam getting 3hrs max only for normal usage.. pls pls don&#39;t every go wth any 2 in models. Check battery life before
Vry low budget 😁💛

Plz giveaway one of your product to me
Hi 🙋🏻‍♂️...Please also review Lenovo yoga 6! Thanks.

Budget laptop , but its 1.45 lakh XD























Review the PS5 guys
Hey Pratima, would be nice if you could get your hands on a Chuwi Corebook X for a budget laptop review. You can even find it under 500$ on offer (i got mine with 460$+) It is a very good value for money laptop. Please see if you guys can get it for a review.
Great review. Big fan from India ❣️
HP Envy X360 Loved Your Review❤️
Waited for this for so long! Thank u guyz🙏
Budget word should be used only for below 100k laptops
Why do few people watch laptop videos? I watch them more than your phone videos.

What about Indian price
GOD BLESS MY FAVOURITE TECHNOLOGY YOUTUBER!<br>I THINK IT IS A GOOD LAPTOP.
If you are paying $850 or Nrs 1.45 Lakh you better go with M1 MacBook Air.
Pratima, keep reviewing laptops 🙌
I&#39;m using HP ENVY x360 Ryzen5 ❤️❤️

you really deserve 10 million subscribers..a shout out to the person who really did the review..the presenter is also a delight to watch..😃
Beautiful . sweet voice . very expensive laptop
Which game was that which she played?
And  what about the speakers?
I guess the best would be the HP Pavillion x360; it has the same specs, except for the 14 inches screen.


A fan from India

Those aren&#39;t speakers on top.....
Hi Matthew,<br><br>I like your videos, I would like to have a suggestion. I am looking for a laptop under $1300 cad. Could you please recommend a good laptop?I am expecting to have an 11-gen, 512 SSD, 16 GB Ram, and AMD Ryzen 7.<br><br><br>If anyone can help me out, i would be thankful.
Not sure how aggressively this guy is typing to make the screen wobble but I&#39;m imagining him raising his hands above his head for every keystroke lmfao
Others reviewer say the speaker are just air vents

I&#39;m watching on it rn, the 2022 model
Mine tends to get quite hot on the top left of the deck just from regular use (netflix…) is this normal?
I have a laptop like this. How do I turn the speakers on that&#39;s facing up to you?


I have this product and I want to buy a stylus are any of the hp pens compatible? Does anyone know?
hey hi what about the i7 11th gen processor? is that processor good enough for coding and programming?
Whats the graphic card in this ?
Backlight Keyboard Is There Or Not

Its crazy how you can literally get this now for like 650 euros
Heyy would the hinges get weak over time? I am planning to buy one soon for college and i expect to work with it for 5 years at least. Can someone comment about their experience? Thank you
Do you recommend this for video edition?
Considering to get this. Anyone out there who has this for at least a year, how is it&#39;s performance now?
"The problem with the device is that it gets so hot that you can&#39;t put it on your knees
<br>The outer frame is metallic, which absorbs heat
<br>To the point that I suspected that the graphics card fan was not working, so I did a test to make sure that it was working
<br>It works, but it&#39;s weak"
Is it good for drawing with an active pen?<br>Thanks
Great review but does it fold all the way back? It looks like it doesn&#39;t...
Hey thanks for the great review...I was trying not to get a new machine but i do music and my old HP is starting to lag a bit so i had to breakdown and upgrade and landed with a few options but this had the specs i needed to get back to music production. thanks again, PeaceLove&amp;GodBless (&quot;
180°
I have this and the hinge is busted.
UPDATE: I tried buy it ....they Discontinued the laptop😫 lol
I love the fact that you can change things out and add stronger Biggers things bravo HP Envy 👏 I might go with this one. Thank you my friend for the review.
Hi, doesn&#39;t Isn&#39;t it a problem that the speakers are near the keyboard? I&#39;m talking about when you hold the keyboard down and the screen towards you, or when you put it at 45 ° etc .... In those cases, won&#39;t the speakers give a &quot;far&quot; or muffled sound? I hope you will answer me, thanks in advance
How do you screen shot on this computer??


wait are the hinges that bad??
What about SATA slot?
The grills on top are not speakers.
I use it to edit videos and photos long hours with the charger stick to it, now the battery got swollen . 😑
The point of buying a 2 in 1 of 15 inches is to have a numpad. It is a dealbreaker.
Sorry, your product link is useless. All I got from Best Buy is this: &quot;Hello! Choose a country.&quot; Okay, so I did, and then I stayed right at where I was: &quot;Hello! Choose a country.&quot; Whatever.
I&#39;m here bc I&#39;m trying to buy for a compatible pen for 15m-bq121dx haha pls kill me, if you have the same pls send me link 😭
i have the hp envy 15 360 ...but is totatlly different to this one
Any idea which is better between HP Envy 15 vs HP Envy 15 X360 ? The fact that you can fold X360 is that such a big advantage ? Is Intel i7 (Envy) better than AMD Ryzen ( Envy X360 ). I need to run computer programs / virtual machines / local server etc. and am no big gamer but do like to play sometimes. Thank you !!!
anyone knows if it has 2 NVME slots ?
Ok, I&#39;m a photographer so I use adobe frequently. I was thinking about taking the ryzen 5 version because it was more into my budget. Any advice is appreciated.
I love this computer, my brother gave it to me
HP audio is better
just got it yesterday from Best buy for less than $700. I like it so far.
Does anyone know how to turn the computer back on when it goes to sleep in like tablet mode? I don’t know how, so I have to keep unfolding it to turn it back on every time 😭
Can we use this laptop for interior design?

pm
sir where can i get its screen protector?
i much prefer the envy models over the spectre, they are so much more sleek
I like it…well balanced for what I need it for…and the price was not bad when I purchased it …the heating problem was the bit a of an issue but after a minute, it does cool down while in-use..👍🏾
I have a question so if have an iphone and would need to constantly connect it to my laptop would i need to get the intel instead or can i still get the amd and get some sort of adapter or something???
Would love to see your thoughts on the 5500u. The average person isn&#39;t buying this model and and it&#39;s great to see how powerful the 5700 is with 16 GB HPs target audience isn&#39;t buying the $1309 version when it starts at around $700.


Thank you so much for this review. I was about to buy this but i know that-that hinge will be huge issue specially I run around so much.
people say there is a big issue with the wifi 6 chip, specifically that wifi drops frequently has this happened to anyone else?
I just bought this: HP Envy x360 15.6&quot; Touchscreen 2-in-1 Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5700U - 1080p - Windows 11, ....and came with its numeric keypad at the right (but the laptop in the video doesn&#39;t have the mentioned # keypad).  why is that? thanks
Always great videos, but don&#39;t be fooled those are fake speaker grills. The speakers are downward facing. I am surprised you did not notice that when yo opened up. You can see them right there. Pretty funny.
in the market today for an upgrade and I&#39;ve realised that if it&#39;s not Monzi it&#39;s not enough info...
How is this laptop with CAD programs? I won&#39;t be designing a whole plane or anything like that. I have a small metal fabrication business. So I just wanted to make sure this laptop could handle that type of work
How´s the battery performance?
Guys i need help i have this laptop with Ryzen 7 . I have found some trouble with the speakers. The sound is louder coming from the bottom of the laptop compared to where the speakers are actually placed. Why could this be?
Thanks for the great video Matthew.. I’m curious as to how this laptop compares to the  <br>Lenovo Flex 5 14&quot; 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 5700U - 1080p - Windows 11 from Costco. I’m a student and am torn between the two. Do you have a preference?





How would this laptop do on DaVinci resolve for example? Paired with the dress exact specs?
The envy line is so much better than spectre 👍🏽
Is the 5500u better bang for buck than the 5700u ?
What pen should I buy for this laptop?
i dont understand as to how everybody who has this laptop still uses it.<br>a few months ago the entire keyboard stopped working and it wasn&#39;t because of any dirt-issues<br>to this day i find no updates that actually fixed the keyboard.
Gezzzzz can you say computer snob?
Can someone PLEASE tell me what pen is compatible with this model? I have the same one, just with Ryzen 5 instead. It didn’t come with a pen and I need it so I can draw. It’s 15m-eu0033dx
The HP line of Envy is really bad. I do not understand why some people even spent time on this product. I had one of these for two years, and it was extremely noisy on the level of being embarrassed of operating the machine, the USB ports and the Wireless was unstable. I do not recommend it except if you want the HP Customer Service asking you to sent the laptop for repair in the middle of the pandemic where people were working from Home, including the HP Technicians. It is also embarrassing for the owners of this YouTube channel to promote this kind of product. Some self respect does not harm.
Are these upgradable?
Is the keyboard backlit???
I just picked one up from a local bb and mostly I like it but the laptop can barely run League of Legends.
Aren&#39;t the grills actually vents? Or so some other reviewer said.
Is envy x360 15 ryzen 7 better or pavilion x360 14 i7 better?
Great video! What model is the HP Pen that works with this unit?
garbage laptops
I just want to know if its vr compatible
Better then yoga?
Honestly, this Envy x360 is the worst laptop i&#39;ve had in all 7 of them. <br>It is getting super hot while playing anything, even low spec games. <br>Sometimes it is freezing for 1-2 sec and it gets back to normal afterwards.<br>The cooler is SUPER noisy even while browsing, sometimes for no reason.<br>And now, after ~8 months of usage, THE DISPLAY IS STARTING TO GET OUT OF IT&#39;S &quot;CASE&quot; for some reason. Have to mention i don&#39;t even move him from the desk.
I got myself HP Envy 2020 with 64GB RAM and 2 TB SSD Hard Drive. I think the 2020 model looks MUCH BETTER than 2021 model. It came with AMD Rzyen 7 5700. AMD is CONSIDERABLY FASTER  than Intel i7! I paid $1699 for it. All the other laptops don&#39;t come with enough hard drive space. HP Envy IS SUPER NICE, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!






Hello I am a DJ that needs your advice. I need to purchase a new laptop. Preferably an HP and need some help deciding what model to get.
By the way, those aren&#39;t speakers. There just there for show
beautiful t-shirt
I am looking for a thin and not so huge laptop for work. Basically for programming and software development, is this perfect for those two? What about coding and maybe watching Netflix etc? I wanted the iPad mini because of its size but I hear the mini iPad isn’t great for programming or software.
How do you go to change what speaker you want to use
i have this laptop
I&#39;m pretty sure that the laptop now <b>includes the pen</b> so you don&#39;t need to buy it separately. Also the cheapest you can buy a new one is £999.99
I can be completely wrong buy I have a feeling that those hinges can cause issues in long term use
something worth noting is that 5700U is zen 2 not zen 3
compatible pen ?
So advice me <br>HP ENVY X360 15<br>or <br>HP ENVY 14
Can I check if the usb c port can be used for charging?
Love the music used in testing the speakers🥺
Is this okay for light gaming? Like older fallout titles or old strategy games?
How would it do for student in college?

I read a lot of reviews complaining about loud and continuous fan noise, and overheating . Is anyone experiencing this? I wouldn&#39;t use it for gaming,  only for streaming, surfing, Office apps, some occasional coding. Thanks


I was able to get this laptop on Labor Day on Costco for 800. I think it was a amazing deal!

Almost every google search of mine for laptop reviews, leads me to your channel. Great job!

DOD uses Envy and loves them .
That missing numpad on a 15&quot; laptop is a dealbreaker imo<br>Speakers on a laptop are extremely useless anyway
Which would you recommend for music production this one or a MacBook Pro?? I bought this one (haven’t unboxed) because the guy recommended it saying more bang for my buck but I want to know which one would be better<br><br>Any advice would be much appreciated 🙏🏼
Is this also  good for gaming?
They got rid of the number pad?  What a bummer.
Do not buy this laptop!!!! I have had one for 5 months and yes you get a pen but you can&#39;t use the pen if nothing on the laptop works. First a speaker went then when I was plugging in a Headset I cracked the screen because my thumb which was holding the laptop steady applied a bit too much pressure. When the screen cracked the touch screen no longer worked. But I could still use it as a regular laptop. Then the right hinge went, I never dropped or misused the laptop in any way.  A few days after the hinge went I turned off the laptop and it never turned on again.  Will they repair it? , well not the screen that was my fault, and not the hinge that is physical damage and probably not that it won&#39;t turn on but maybe they will. Send it to us and we will decide if it is covered or not, But do not forget if you send it to us and your data is erased or someone steals your PWs that&#39;s just too bad! I have had a couple of ipads with cracked screen, even holes in the bevel and they kept working. Do not buy this laptop it is a waste of money and time.

Is it heating up or making a loud fan noise?
What about battery life .let me know..em from Italy
Love HP Envy laptops they are so beautiful and very good ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍
Does HP store ship outside USA? I tried to order using the given link but it does not accept the information I put in.
Still using my envy that has a ryzen 5 2500u in it and the thing still is doing really good 3 years later. If i upgrade, id defintley buy another envy i feel like they feel premium even though they arent. Ive owned premium laptops that feel cheaper than the envy
Sadly and ironically with the timing of this great review I just discovered that my battery has swollen and bulged the keyboard on my unit.  I thought it was an optical illusion or a design feature until I did a little research on line.  I have found that there is no fix other than replacing the battery.


Is this laptops Ram and internal SSD upgradable !?!?

Mine is super slow
the link is broken
nice review - is it this model# 15M-EU0023DX
&quot;aimed towards budget to mid range users&quot; also says &quot;now this is $1300&quot;
the screen is too dim is this normal
Is the screen bleed normal in this laptop? I just purchased mine today and noticed there is a white light leak on the top middle part of the screen.
PLEASE google the hinge screw issues with this device before purchasing. Manufacturer defect causes damage to hardware and screen within a year. HP will not accept responsibility nor honor the warranty, though countless users are having the same issue.
This or Lenevo yoga 7i 15?
Puzzles me how the envy x360 is so much more affordable than the standard 15 inch envy. Like a lot cheaper
That’s not speakers on top
this or a base model 13.3 macbook pro
Which one is better overall between the hp envy x360 and the core i5 samsung galaxy book?

Looks great, performance is OK. However I&#39;ve never seen so bad drivers on a laptop (3500U version). Screen flickers occasionally when browsing youtube, keyboard driver sometimes fail after waking up, it had issues with Wi-Fi, which fortunately got fixed soon. Oh and HP just installs telemetry, no questions asked.
I think it&#39;s an awesome laptop. I only have 1 complaint but it&#39;s a major fail. In this latest version they removed the side power button. This means that once it goes to hibernate when in tablet mode there is no way to wake it up without flipping it over,  unfolding the keyboard, pressing the power button and then flipping it back into tablet mode. Major inconvenience.

Do not buy this laptop. Look carefully at reviews on reviews about the hinges. Mine broke after 6 months and hp waranty considers it as accidental damage. Its a well know fault by hp, but still refuse to fix for free. I got fulled by this type of videos and now Im stuck with a damaged laptop. Would be nice for this type of videos to actually give all the facts.

What&#39;s the maximum RAM that it can be upgraded to?


Can it run autodesk inventor, unity, autocad, fusion360 etc.
Any recommendations for docking stations for this laptop?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=3m05s">3:05</a> No sir, I have the same Envy 15 inch with 8th gen intel from 2018. And this shit has both, numpad and awsome front top dual speakers. So sounds like this is just an excuse

Can we change backlight colour??
As of now there&#39;s a 4K AMOLED display option 😍


How do you eject flash drives? Is it a key combination? When I right click it doesn&#39;t come up...

hi Hp. please make <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> or 3:2 aspect ratio
I have the 15 ich version of HP envy x360 with numpad and intel core i7 11 gen. It works great with youtube and the internet but it is hard to play games on this laptop.


Thank you. Great  review
its not upward firing speakers, its cooling vents
This is a awesome review!

I’m looking at this computer for a Work from Home. Can I connect Ethernet cable to this?


Imma be honest, he should stop manhandling the laptop I mean I can see the screen bending Jesus
this one looks different than mine, i have an HP ENVY 360 / grey / i7...with &quot;bang &amp; olufsen&quot; speakers ubicated below the screen and not on the sides... and I bought it 5 months ago...

who doesnt love a big black deck
does anyone know if there are any pens w/ pressure sensitivity that i can buy to go w/ this laptop?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=2m53s">2:53</a> Matthew Moniz putting memes in his tech videos! 😂
I just bought the HP Envy X360,2 in 1 core i7, 16GB ram, 512 gb SSD, and it’s not opening. I ordered it online from HP website brand new and it’s not opening. When I try to charge it, the orange light comes on then goes off. I pressed the power button so many times and hold the power button long enough but it’s still not responding.<br>What could be the cause?

Im on this laptop , it has been working good!!!<br>I love the touch screen , and boy this is like a tablet laptop


Can you review asus rog strix G15
this computer always gives me issues with the mousepad and fingerprint scanner to the point that i had to use a wired mouse because it stopped working
Why are all the laptop names nowadays like this.. Envy, Omen, Predator, Legion.. all names with some kinda negative connotation to it.


I bought the model with 250 nits at Bestbuy (no pen) and I&#39;m very satisfied with it, the review is spot on and something more to add, DPC latency in mine is giving me 697 after 15 min of running Latencymon. For working this laptop will cover all my needs once I update the ram to 32gb, finally a laptop that is not an oven like the Asus.

HP Envy 15 (2020) vs HP Envy 15 (2021) which one should be buyed ? (i5 versions)

Matthew Dell XPS 15 or the X360 15?
&quot;they are not upward firing speakers. They are air vents.&quot; Andrew Marc david


Are you sure these are front firing speakers?
Exactly what I wanted to know
Does the 250 nits screen has 99% srgb?

Is it better than the surface pro 7 ?
I think those are ventilation vents and not front speakers sadly
Bought this laptop at the start of this year and honestly has been working pretty great for me. Was even running Far Cry 4




Which one i should buy, the intel with thurderbolt 4 or the ryzen with it 5000 series even tough it isnt the zen3 one



Thank you, Matthew, for being very clear about this video being sponsored. I appreciate your integrity (not just your integrity, obviously, the review was excellent too).


Glossy screen... I&#39;m out.
Wrong info.  Those are not top firing speakers, they are air vents.
I have this one 13 inches (13-ay0111AU)  everything is very good except for the HEAT  in daily life I live in Thailand and the average temperature is 95 - 103 cc, this is a big problem in long term using, I hope hp fix this in the next-gen and it will be perfect.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=4m00s">4:00</a> dang do you see that bend 🤔🤔 idk about this
Hello question? am traying find a great computer that I cud edit videos for youtube what computer desktop or laptop you think has a great performance and gigabyte and ram at a affordable price my price range under $800 .hope to hear from you
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=3m00s">3:00</a> FUCK NUM-PADS
As long as the speakers are at the bottom, they are not located on the edges of the keyboard. Why it wasn’t said Yes because HP sponsored it

That&#39;s not upwards firing speakers those are air vents. Check it again please
Those aren&#39;t speakers, they are vents.
I have the HP envy 360 2020 15 inch  love my laptop 360 is the best
Bro i got the exact same model for, 1135 usd
Wrong info about the speakers
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=6m54s">6:54</a> &quot;budget to midrange users&quot;<br><br>Please stop with the sniffy dust. $1300 is not budget. It&#39;s really disappointing that most laptop reviewers lately seem to do nothing but go &quot;Oh, it doesn&#39;t look like a turd or hit 100C, BUY BUY BUY BUY for $1,946 despite the creaky hinges&quot;
me gustaría usarla para editar fotografías, Diseño 3D y edición de video 4k, seria posible?

Is the new model available in India now?
man I want to buy this HP Envy x360 15 (2021), and isn&#39;t yet available in Canadian HP site or anywhere just yet.
If I use for school work and some light gaming. Would you recommend this laptop or Samsung galaxy book pro? (specifically on performance)


BOYCOTT HP FREE PALESTINE!
Hey Matthew, are you sure these are upward facing speakers? I&#39;ve heard in another review that these are air vents, could you follow up on this one? Great review btw!

winner!
appleLover fU ck review.
Hey man, I’m a developer I do lots of coding and graphics. I’m also a student who likes to take notes, so I could really use a convertible labtop. What would you recommend for me ? HP ENVY or Specter?

The HP sounds good.
No one should buy a tablet or computer (or accessories) for less than 30% off...
"which one of these would you suggest ? making a new comparison video would be better lol.
<br>1. M15 R5
<br>2. M17 R4
<br>3. Legion 5 Pro"
Any suggestions for convertible gaming laptop 2021 for graphical use...as per indian market?
They arent speakers they are only vents just look inside!
great review. i thought i&#39;d decided on the lenovo, dropped the acer from my list...now i have both the pavillion &amp; the envy as semi-finalists...ha ha. about USD 120 difference here (envy vs pav...south africa)...but all come with the pen...such pressure...🤔...thanks for nothing, man. (tongue-in-cheek)!


I prefer TKL keyboards on Laptops!
Just want to ask that... I have recently bought Asus tuf f15 model with I7-10870H and Gtx 1660ti..But when I play games it heats and temperature stays around 90-93°c in GPU... Is it a problem in long term..????
The speakers are not downfiring right?

Would it be better to use ac power adapter or usb c charger ?
Anyone know when/where the Ryzen 5 version is available??? Im only seeing the ryzen 7 available on the hp website.
first one sound better - 2nd more like radio quality. good video. thanks
Just yesterday I bought it and I am very satisfied with its performance.




Hey excellent review. I just wanted to know does this laptop with the 400 nits glossy screen have good colour reproduction?
Nice
Hey Matthew i have a budget around 1500 i want a laptop but i want the powerbrick up to 100watts do u have any suggestions

Two things<br>these are not top firing speakers<br>sound test sounds like there à 30-40hz background noise like a permanent one<br>Otherwise good review as always


👍 👍 👍 👍 👍
The keyboard looks so similar to the 2020 13 inch model. Are they really the same part that HP reused and are possibly cross compatible?
PLEASE REVIEW THE DELL INSPIRON 5518!!!!
Too bad i cant buy that on Philippines
Such a nice laptop from HP but that loose hinge seems like a big issue. How does a giant company like HP misses out on basics like these ?



Would like to point something out. I&#39;ve seen on many reviews that those are not speakers but they are vents for intake of air as can be seen by opening the laptop

The bios is locked. Thanks HP. 😢
you can&#39;t pause a youtube video on another tab or else your videos will freeze
What are your thoughts on the sticker placements, Matt? They looked like they were slightly off, but passable?

What about india how can we buy ?
It does not have an Ethernet port ?

I want my right Ctrl back.
Thank you for the review, I was waiting for it for a long time. I ordered mine and it will arrive early June 2021. The hinges are definitely something I hope is not going to be that bad, as I suffered from bad hinges in my previous laptop. Honestly, this laptop is perfect for my college use, and yeah definitely get the 400 nits one if you literally wanna be able to see the screen!









I was told the speakers were downward-firing and that those were cooling vents. Is this not the case. Also I believe the speaker bar is at the top on the numpad version. Great review overall! I purchased one about a month ago... still waiting.

Like always chill but WORTHTHE TIME REVIEW!!
Those do not have upward firing speakers
I have the old version of this one, I find it perfect! It looks classy but still has the performance to do heavier tasks and even a bit of gaming if u would like to. Using it now for about 2.5 years and everything works still super fast!





Hey. Do you know if there will be 13 ich version?
Could you do a comparison of this laptop with the 2020 swift 3 with thr ryzen 7?
5700u is a refreshed 4800u. both zen2
Dumb question, but where can you get this in Canada. Can only find the 4500u not ryzen 5000
Really beautiful laptop!
Thats a great looking laptop
800$ for 256gb of storage, nice

I found an asus zenbook 14, ryzen 4500u,  8g ram , 256g ssd, mx350 for 549 is it a better choice
Can it beat the Macbook AIR M1?
Hey Matthew apparently you have made a mistake. the design on the top are not speakers they are just grills for better air flow ?

Please review Framework modular Laptop
Hi, I thought the speakers was down firing.<br>At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=6m02s">6:02</a> aren&#39;t those speakers ? at the bottom ?<br>Great review.



I have to decide between this (the 250nit Ryzen 5 version) and the lenovo flex 5 , which one would you recommend in a 800$budget for basic adobe work ??? And if you have any other suggestions for that criteria !!?<br>Thanks a lot anywayy, the review was great !!!<br>(P.S -Btw it&#39;s better if it&#39;s a 2in1)




Those hinges. Fucking hell. What kind of crap do they think they can get away with this time?
I think these are air vents not speakers


Best 2 in 1 laptop do you recommend?
Envy sounds better. Better compression.
Great review, but those are not speakers...

Nah im fine with my amd nitro 5 with 1650 ti for 670 dollars
Any good usbc to display port cables?
I have the 2018 Envy and it&#39;s still a solid laptop.








Bring more budget amazing performing laptop content more. I miss those days when you all talked about ideapad 15/14


Isn&#39;t the R7-5700U based on the Zen 2 architecture rather than Zen 3?

No availability in my fucking country on the HP store. Just crappy 2019 4700u models. I already know I won&#39;t be able to find it anywhere. The only advantage of globalization: gone. What a travesty.
I have the 2020 r7 version of this - it&#39;s pretty awesome
The deals were absolutely fab!!! Only if they were available in my country :/<br>lovely work again Matthew thank u for that<br>Also, did that ryzen laptop really have MX graphics??? Like I thought they were only supported by intel CPUs coz I&#39;ve never heard about a ryzen CPU with MX dGPUs

Also, @Matthew Moniz, I recently bought this laptop but my D key has gotten mushy. As in I have to apply more force in order for the key to respond. Do you know if the keys are poppable so that I can clean them? Also, do you have any tips on cleaning it?

I&#39;m choosing between this and the base m1 air. I need the power for video editing (mostly 1080p but the are some 4k shots) so I thought m1 MBA, but I also like convertibles for taking notes. My budget is a 1100 dollars, wht do you recommend?












So between HP Envy x360 15  or Lenovo slim 7 pro, witch one is better?























The Envy line has been better than the Spectre line for a while, imo.










I was milimeters away from buying this laptop, but I chose legion 5i ...<br>And i think it was right choice!


Just one thing, The Envy 15 x360 Intel Tigerlake also doesn&#39;t come with Thunderbolt. It has thar same USB 3.2 gen 2 10 Gbps Type-C port with DP 1.4 and PD. Only the 13.3&quot; version, both clamshell and 360, come with TB4. <br>BTW, the price with 5700u, 16gb ram, 512gb SSD and 400 nits display is just $1039 in HP USA store.
I got mine a week ago (intel 11th gen version,16gb ram and 400 nits 4k screen) and it&#39;s absolutely amazing machine!! Thanks for a great review 👍





I have to say, I liked the section with the deal listings. Any thoughts about making that a regular?



Does this power throttle like the Surface Laptop 4 to get that battery life? It would be great now that Intel and AMD are trying to recover from the shock of Apple Silicon to get the full story as the AMD SL4 sucks on battery with a 50% loss of performance and bearing in mind these are ultrabooks for portability then you should caveat battery life as fake (throttled) or true (no restrictions) especially one designed as a tablet alternative? <br><br>Looks an average entrant and TBH there are far better Ryzen clamshells but not so many convertibles like this. There lies my question, if this throttles then get an Intel convertible as the Envy will be useless on battery for anything intensive? The Gaalaaxy Book 360 does not throttle sso that would be a good choice and close in price aided by thee s-pen software suite.
That is zen 2 not zen 3

Not that anyone should care about one hand opening anyway unless you unfortunately only have one hand, but, what you described was that you can open it with one hand if you use your other hand to hold it down. I don&#39;t know about you, or maybe call me crazy, but I think that means that it requires two hands to open.
8*2(16GB dual-channel total) vs 16*2 (32 GB dual-channel total) will there be a difference in gaming performance..???????? not talking about professional workload.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=4m20s">4:20</a>  Speakers are not on top. Those are vents.

I heard those aren&#39;t speakers but air vents. Can you please check?


galaxy book pro please

Hey Matt could you recommend a laptop for college and casual gaming under a 1000 dollars but not a macbook




I think mac OS is not compatible with some applications, so still thinking which laptop to buy.
8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD should be illegal.
Is MacBook air m1 256gb enough for a web developer? Thanks.


anyone remember when Envy used to be brightly colored laptops from Voodoo?

5500u 5700u is zen 2, not very good, but it has hyper threading, the same with 4600u &amp; 4800u last year. I hope they will have 5600u &amp; 5800u options. 13.3 - 14 inch will fit their hinge design.

Finally! Been waiting for this for months


Hey! Would you recommend this HP or the Surface 3? I’m worried about the HP reputation for quality.



I see laptops like these and i jus think &quot;buy a macbook&quot; and I&#39;m not even a huge fan of apple



You said the price is $1039 but the text showed $1309


Is the price $1309 or $1039? at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=4m36s">4:36</a>

Is it $1039 like you said or is it $1309 like you displayed??

Awesome review! I really like how you always consider the value for dollars spent in your reviews. A mid 2021 value champ video would be nice!


Great video Matt :)

I got a m1 macbook air and it feels soo different from anything else on the market. Specs aside, you pick it up, use it and you feel that you have something unique. the build quality, trackpad, its elegance, its something that even much much more expensive windows notebook cant match. having said that, i now feel windows as an OS is by far way superior for a power user than Mac OS, so guess im changing again


Mine came in yesterday!!



Same, I prefer TKL keyboard laptops.
It’s kinda hard to choose which laptop to buy but now I have made my final decision and that is The MacBook Air m1




I had one of these a couple years ago and it almos burn my lap and even hands.  Used to get extremely hot I decided to sell it. Hopefullt they addressed that cause I really liked the design and it performed well.


Is there a certain Laptop you would recommend if I were to spend a maximum of a thousand and just needed it for casual gaming and university?









Mmm $1039??! It shows 1309 on vid...

Lol, you think that 1300$ are budget or midrange price?? This overpriced crappy garbage should costs not over than 400$🤮🤧
i studied the market recently. most 6-8 core 15w ryzens has insane value. all you should do-find a good laptop with it.<br>market is trying to sell me tiger lake 4 cores for more money but no thanks. <br>market is basically says i know you are stupid and you have no choice.

But how is camera quality, Matt? :(<br>And I agree with you: HP missed the opportunity to make the screen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHtLfLkTB-0&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>.<br>Should be the new standard in Ultrabooks.


I don’t recommend the surface laptops. They don’t last in long term. The previous company where I worked for, ditched the Microsoft laptops because of the poor quality. They switched to dell, the IT infrastructure was really happy about the change.<br><br>Cool video though !
I <b>ENVY</b> that laptop hahahaahhaha.......<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;ll shut up.

Awesome review .

13 inch would be sweet spot for the 2in ones.
* Correction. The speakers are DOWNWARDS firing. The grills on top are air vents. Also, would you buy this? Also, if you missed it I reviewed the iMac comparing it to the MacBook Pro 13  here - <a href="https://youtu.be/PMeAYLZ0EuI">https://youtu.be/PMeAYLZ0EuI</a>

I haven&#39;t been this early😁
Number 3 in regards to views new record
I just got this laptop and I really love it! The ONLY issue I have so far is the usb port. It was SO hard to get my flash drive in the port which made me very nervous as all of my school assignments are on it. It was even worse when I pulled it out 😬
Please which generation is that?
Hi I’m not a techy person. Is this good if I install 3 programming softwares like python, maple, etc?
I can’t find it anywhere, I found some that looked quite similar but the keyboard is different ! It doesn’t have the numbers keyboard on the right :((
Only one problem and that is that us seniors can&#39;t ever afford a new laptop ever. Due to the overly high prices of new laptops or desktops.
I&#39;m looking for a laptop and I&#39;m between 2. Should I buy HP Envy x360 Convert 15-eu0006nv or Lenovo IdeaPad 5 pro (ryzen 5)?
What video editor did you use to test this?

Oh my, I didn&#39;t get mine with the pen :&#39;( it has been a long time, so I cannot complain anymore, but if I knew it comes with it, I would deff ask for it.. It would make mu life easier xD
Can this run unity3d as well as zbrush?
This is an awesome video! I have watched several laptop reviews and this was the most useful by far. I appreciate the honesty and the descriptions made me laugh a few times. 😄

Would you recommend this or the yoga 6 13 ryzen5
Keyboard and trackpad are cheap.
Considering to get this. Anyone out there who has this for at least a year, how is it&#39;s performance now?
how would it run roblox and gta 4 at low settings?
Please How do I connect to monitor using the type c port?
I also Brought the Same Laptop but I didn&#39;t get any Pen do you paid extra for that?<br>Waiting for Reply
Aluminum chassis or plastic? Dual or Single channel ram?
Does it have a finger print sensor???
Having owned one since 2019 i can say its build quality isnt superb, and the ryzen 7 3700u is a very slow processor.
Does this laptop suffers of hinge problems?
Mine didn&#39;t come with pen?!
yall got a pen with it??? i just bought one seperately...

I got this laptop months back, (would be 10 months), and I want to say it is absolutely AMAZING! I love the keyboard, and the built in lights are amazing in the dark. I love the sleek look of the laptop, especially the touchpad. The key spacing, in my opinion, is amazing while doing work, as it lets me type extremely fast with minimized errors. There are also MANY cases you can find online, and each of them are amazing! I have one for myself, and it fits perfectly onto the laptop. The only problem I have is with on of the USB ports, where you kind of have to push this little wall down, but it is not too bad, and wouldn&#39;t affect my rating at all. Overall, I give this 5/5, and I have NO problems with it whatsoever, even nearly a year later of it falling off my table, or sometimes splashes of water on it.



Can you write on pdf files using this laptop?


sheesh naruto shippuden
Mine didn’t come with a stylist?! 🙁

My parents got me HP ENVY Convertible  15m-es0xx 11th Generation, but I&#39;m still gathering information about this pc. Is this the latest Hp envy Generation?
Just bought one for $300 on Facebook market let’s see if it come in good condition
&quot;Lord have mercy on you&quot; lol! Made me laugh! Great review!

Is it have the webcam?

This is the Same Laptop I have!


Thanks

Hi I just got the HP ENVY 360 but I find it difficult entering in it cuz the @ button is the the letter Q and it’s not displaying the @ button. Can anyone help me out or I should return it? Leelah from Germany 🇩🇪
Got this laptop a few days ago and i&#39;m mega thrilled. I must have gotten an updated version because the fans are hardly noticeable and graphics are really sharp. Only downer is the camera. Otherwise for the price, I think it&#39;s a brilliant bargain compared to its contemporaries that cost much more and don&#39;t even provide as much features as this one. Very pleased so far.

Would you recommend this over the 13&quot; M1 Macbook Air, asking as a student?

i got it but my pen stopped working two months later although it charges perfectly like i can see the red and white light it shows but it seems like its not responding to the screen . what do i do ?!
gosh I should have waited for this one (a more recent laptop) because I have the older version from 3 years ago and it&#39;s kinda bad. I wanted a laptop for college and BOOM covid hit and I ended up doing my hw at home, which was fine because the laptop I have is HEAVY and huge for my backpack.<br>either way the specs on this seems betters for gaming than the one I have.
CAN YOU CHARGE THIS LAPTOP WITH USB-C?!?!?!
This laptop it’s amazing! Literally has everything.
It&#39;s a good laptop.  There are a few flaws.  Audio card doesn&#39;t seem to work all the time since the music or audio skips at times.  Another thing that is fumbling is the vexing start time when you close the device and the open it hours later.  In the sense that that the Power button does not know what to do.  I&#39;ve held it down amd I&#39;ve double clicked and held.  Somewhat finicky.  I don&#39;t do heavy work besides school work so my machine isn&#39;t under stress.  So far I like it.  I could&#39;ve gone with a cheaper option but at the time I wanted a computer that was going to last me some time.   I do see it in my future life since I&#39;ll be able to do a few upgrades.
Great and thorough review.  I just ordered the Envy x360 with the following options: 15.6&quot; diagonal, 4K UHD (3840 x 2160), OLED, multitouch-enabled, UWVA, edge-to-edge glass, micro-edge, 400 nits as well as the Intel Core i7-1195G7 (up to 5.0 GHz, 12 MB L3 cache, 4 cores, 8 threads) + NVIDIA GeForce.<br>Seems like the screen will be 150 nits brighter with 4K clarity, so I&#39;m interested to see that.<br>One of the reasons I chose HP was they offered a pretty decent discount for veterans.  I ended up saving $325 with the discount on the order making it $1200 with tax.<br>I&#39;ll report back on the my thoughts on the screen quality and processor speed.<br>Thanks again for a great review!





Can we use this laptop for interior design?
Hi guys maybe ypu could help me out, I have the exact same laptop for studyinh and I&#39;m wondering if there is an option to start it when its folded like a tablet
Mines didn&#39;t come with a pen..... nice

Excellent review and this seems like the model I would go for. The one question I  have is how smooth is the stylus ( Asus models are not great).  I teach online mainly now so a smooth pen is essential.  I have a Samsung Note 10 phone and the stylus on that is really smooth.

i was thinking to buy it.... but now I&#39;m not going to...I&#39;m looking for a laptop to teach online, fast , performing that can be used also to study and entertainment. Do you have any recommendations? Please help me out!
What the fuck?! I didn&#39;t get the pen???!


Isn&#39;t it detachable?

I bought this laptop because I needed a new one and watched your review. Mine did not come with a stylus.
Please does the hp envy x360 13inch i7 512GB SSD 16GB RAM 11th gen comes with pen as well.

Mines having issues downloading YouTube (original). Any ideas to resolve this issue. I’m not a computer savvy just bought it for work purposes but would be nice to have apps I normally use. Thanks in advance!
I really wanted to buy this one and I am still second guessing myself but I found that the clicking on almost all HP laptops was shockingly bad and unpleasant to feel. It’s not a smooth easy click. I don’t understand how HP doesn’t consider this a problem. <br>Also for the price the laptop’s keyboard font just really looks awful to me and is not in style.

Mmm this laptop with 400nits screen or a legion 5 with 250 nit screen?
Bro wtf im watching naruto you spoiled the naruto &amp; sasuke fight &gt;:(

this laptop is perfect for programmers and developers
That link leads to a product that says it has 400 nits.
i bought this laptop like 4 months ago but i didnt get a pen do i have to purchase that separately ????
Would this be good for sims 4?


Boring review

Hey bro nice video but when you talk about thermals lets know the option of how the maker has decided to cool the laptop by opening it up please. Lets see the hardware ourselves. I really need to kniw the thermals of this particular laptop as i intend ordering it.

It&#39;s $750 at Walmart with a 512gig ssd. I just got one myself

Do we have an option to add storage and ram?
I have a question regarding this hp,  do you think the hp stylus it&#39;s good or not because I have reada lot of reviews that says that it&#39;s not good, I have a : HP ENVY x360 Convertible 15-eu0xxx, pls answer me bro and sorry for my bad english
mine came with out the stylus pen??

I bought a HP Envy x360 15 (2021), it has 400 nits

Thanks for the help! Sadly you&#39;re right about the screen quality being important to me. Most of the downsides don&#39;t get to me, but that one...yeah I may keep looking. Though I&#39;m not 100% against this one if I can&#39;t find something I don&#39;t like better.



"Honestly, this Envy x360 is the worst laptop i&#39;ve had in all 7 of them. 
<br>It is getting super hot while playing anything, even low spec games. 
<br>Sometimes it is freezing for 1-2 sec and it gets back to normal afterwards.
<br>The cooler is SUPER noisy even while browsing, sometimes for no reason.
<br>And now, after ~8 months of usage, THE DISPLAY IS STARTING TO GET OUT OF IT&#39;S &quot;CASE&quot; for some reason. Have to mention i don&#39;t even move him from the desk.
<br>
<br>I&#39;m still wondering what else could broke soon in this &quot;machine&quot;. At least it looks good, lol."
Thank you good review 🤙🏻

What is the graphics card in it

Does this model have a TPM module?
Great video. Thanks!

how weird...my envy didn&#39;t come with  it&#39;s own pen....<br><br>😦

Can anyone offer an advice? I&#39;m picking between this one and 17-inch version. All the hardware is the same, the only difference there is that the 15 version is convertible, the 17 one is not, but it&#39;s bigger. And approximately 50% more expensive.<br>I&#39;ve had 15.6 laptop and when I bought the current, 17.3, I definitely fell in love with the bigger screen. I&#39;ve never owned any tablet, I prefer the traditional laptop settings, but I think a touchscreen laptop is a nice compromise. And I was soon convinced by my first smartphone after refusing it because of my experience with pre-smart touchscreen phone. But given the high price of the 17 version, I started wondering, which is more useful - bigger screen or convertibility. Any experience with both?

Price

If I was the owner of HP company I would sue you 🤦🏻‍♂️<br>What is wrong with you! 80% of the video talking bad about it



Useless video
Nerds be like: (Literally says that it was 47% and 63% does graphics things even though We don&#39;t mind lol)
Hp envy x360 or the Dell 14 Inspiron 5410 2 in 1?

Can we  use this laptop for graphic designers?


Would this laptop be able to run auto cad inventor programme and not be slow as hell while doing other things with the laptop like PowerPoint or excel?




Is it heating up or making a loud fan noise?
Love HP Envy laptops they are so beautiful and very good ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍
How were you able to get pressure sensitivity on your pen?? Something I’m struggling with
What are the upgradable options ?<br><br>I was looking forward to buy a laptop, and thanks to your detailed review I thought of going for this. But can I upgrade the RAM or ssd in future or it is soldered ? Is there any extra ram or m.2 slots. <br><br><br>Please let me know


Thanks for your honest review. Really needed someone to tell me the harsh truths about the negatives.. ie. color accuracy, brightness and battery life. Thanks 😊

nice review - is it this model# 15M-EU0023DX
Is this good for computer engineering student?

I&#39;m loving this laptop !!
I thought they removed the number pad?
I love everything about this laptop. Except it&#39;s a little washed out display.

Do you think this with i7, 16g and 1TB is good for laptop as an engineering major?

You’ll need to move up to the Spectre if you want a USB-C charger.

Could you recommend me a laptop that is like this one (light up keys n every thing) but with better color quality and that has a stable keyboard and mouse pad?
Is this laptop good for games like roblox?
I am looking for a clear case to cover the top of the laptop. I have not received the laptop yet so I can&#39;t measure it. What do you recommend?

I just ordered one of these. I7 processor, 12 gb of Ram and 512gb of storage. I wish I had known about the screen because in the configurator you can get one with a 400 nit display. Other than that I’m super excited, got a great deal. If only August could get here sooner!!!



Yeah I feel the battery is fuckin trash bro. Super disappointed I seriously keep mine at 0 brightness and no back light for my keyboard. Tbh a lil disappointed but it&#39;s not bad definetly more a media laptop not a work laptop
this one looks like a expensive version of the pavilion x360


I have this laptop except mine has 100% sRGB and a 400 nits brightness display. It&#39;s a beast of a laptop. The only thing that gets a bit annoying is the fans when you&#39;re in a quiet setting. Other than that it performs incredibly well.





what do you recommend ?<br>the hp envy x360 with amd ryzen 7 4700U, 16gb ram, 1TB SSD<br>or the macbook air m1, 8gb ram, 256gb ssd




His videos are good<br><br>But am I the only one who is noticing his high pitch voice crack at the end

I just bought the HP Envy X360,2 in 1 core i7, 16GB ram, 512 gb SSD, and it’s not opening. I ordered it online from HP website brand new and it’s not opening. When I try to charge it, the orange light comes on then goes off. I pressed the power button so many times and hold the power button long enough but it’s still not responding.<br>What could be the cause?
I Want to buy a laptop just for personal use not work or school, just to have around the house I will probably barely use it. Will this laptop be good what would anybody recommend?


What is the model &amp; specification of this laptop  ???



Honestly when it comes to laptop&#39;s my top two brands are Dell and HP.


please give some expression

I hope it&#39;s good for graphic designers? I want to get 1 for myself


the screen is it decent when it comes to watching movies ?

Dude you tested the battery life wrong you should never use it at 50 percent and be like this is the battery life, you should measure the battery life in nits which is the brightness, for example this laptop at 150 nits which is the same as the unupgraded screen it gets 14 hours if web browsing on the new model

Hi, I have x360 13&quot; 2 in 1, why is the rotation lock greyed out? need to restart then it will unlock. how do keep it stay active or available all the time?. Is it bugs or some tweak that will solve this issue?
great laptop, extremely versatile. not a huge fan of the battery, wish the screen was a little brighter. use it for work, personal use, it is quick and snappy and overall great performance .





"If you listen the voice carefully, this laptop do have a speaker in top side fan hole.
<br>So this laptop have 3 speaker, 2 on low case 1 on top case."
I&#39;m looking for a good computer what you have in mind?

Hi i would like the link for this laptop. Thanks



I have the HP Envy x360 15.6&quot; Intel i7 with iRIS Xe Graphics.  Pretty good overall, especially the performance.  I&#39;d recommend it; However, if you need a machine that contains real power and a great display, purchase the HP Spectre x360 15.6&quot; (2020-2021 version).






I got the exact same. Mine did NOT come with a stylus tho

Surprisingly, u didn’t mention anything about the “tablet mode” not being able to turn back on after going to sleep. You must flip it back to pc mode and tap on power button… why? This is a flaw of the decade and hp doesn’t seem to have the solution for this. If anybody knows a way out, pleeeaaassse kindly share. Thanks



The review is gd but there is one slight mistake. As the envy line sits below the spectre line with couple of premium features reserved for the spectre only like thunderbolt  and the privacy filter, and considering the price, classifying it as a premium laptop is not that accurate. Regarding it as a middle ground between premium and mid-range laptop would be better.

How does it work for any gaming ?

Just bought this, seems a great fit for me!






Is there a 14&quot; available?
what hp pens are compatible with this laptop?


Do we get the stylus with the laptop? Or should we buy it separately?

Why does this video sounds biased against HP. &quot; Less than ideal IO &quot; ? It&#39;s got better IO than 90% laptop out there.

Yeah you got the inferior display. It comes with 400 nit display too which has decent color accuracy, not the best but passable.
Ram max?
I got it today !!!!!
Can you help me on how to change colours of backlit screen????
i have the new ryzen 5 version of this its gread for cad my track pad is great keyboard is amazing smooth soft like mention on the video 1 thing i hate no fn lock
is this a good alternative for a MacBook Pro?

I ordered mine yesterday. I got the AMOLED display and am very excited. should be way more color accurate and beautiful




Just ordered this thanks for the video. My first new laptop in over 9 years ! So excited !!!!














Can I connect my AirPods to this laptop ?

Envy x360 15 or macbook Air? If i go with envy, which would be better intel i7 11th gen or ryzen 7 5700u?

Not good . My screen cracked and it cost £280

I&#39;m looking to purchase to this machine for software engineering. I want to be using Pop or Fedora. Could you please see if either operating systems work on the machine? Thanks!



I&#39;m not able to use the stylus pen. As in, I&#39;m able to tap on the objects and icons and select them but not able to open them even after double clicking on them using pen. Similarly, not able to write also using the pen. I also tried writing after holding the top button but still doesn&#39;t work. Even the right click is not very efficient. is there some additional settings or something that we need to do to write using pen? I&#39;ve set settings using HP pen control app.<br>I&#39;ve bd0004tu model.
Hi for a university student studying pharmacy which 2 in 1 would you recommend, i have had a look and I am conflicted if i should get the :<br>Dell XPS 15<br>HP envy 360 <br>HP Spectre 360 in rose gold and black<br>Surface pro 7 <br>i want it to hopefully last me 3-4 years , could you rank these in order or recommend me the ones you would opt for<br>Thanks ever so much


I&#39;ve struggled finding a case for this laptop though







It drains battery even after completely turned off. I&#39;ve returned one already and this is again a new one.. can you help?
Bro between this hp, galaxy tab s7 plus and Microsoft surface pro 7, which you think is better? Thanks!!!


Does it have windows hello?

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhvkO0qZ-zg&amp;t=7m07s">7:07</a> Pain
Can the laptop work with different model of pen?

Would this be good for editing pictures and 4k video?



I bought the amd ryzen 7 4700u version and after a day it was freezing like every 15 to 20mins, I had to return it. Have ever had this issue?
I suppose you can review this laptop and be critical about it but you have to also consider this model is very midrange in spec anyway. The series does include models with better displays, better processors, and more ram. Some how in this model you spent way to much getting 1TB of storage which I have noted on HPs site being a ton of money compared to the actual cost of a 1TB nvme drive.

my model is AMD and it has a decant screen


it also has a pen on the AMD version ?



I actually sampled the X360 while I was at Costco. I was amazed at how little flex there was in the keyboard and it has more tactile feel than the Lenovo Legion 5 sitting right next to it. I just don&#39;t like that the X360 has 250 nits only. Yikes 😬


You took 250nits model so display will be bad you should have chosen 400nits

this is not 2021 model! do not do clickbait.<br><br>in the new 2021 models, numpad is removed/ touchpad is centered and enlarged. top grill is removed and moved to the keyboard sides.





Hey, could u recommend me a gaming laptop (on which I can record too) for 2021 under 500?




Nice review 👌 I am glad that you have mentioned about the display color. I am not an editor for anything but even I got disappointed by the display color. Why can Hp provide the UHD or 4K display option.



I don&#39;t know the difference between Intel and AMD but which one is better and which one does the envy x360 use?? Please answer me😭

How does this compare to the HP Elitebook?

Wait a Minute this looks like the 2020 model the New one isnt supposed to have a numpad and two speakers on the side
I got an Envy 360 and found many doubts inside HP community, does only the lower speakers work and the front are non functional?
I&#39;ve had two Envy laptops before - my current one is from 2017 and my previous one was from ~2013. One of my favorite features on both was the high quality audio that came out from the top of the laptop. This is literally the most important feature I am looking for - good speakers. I have a good desktop for gaming, I just want a nice screen and good speakers to watch movies and youtube videos.
Ryzen version is significantly cheaper and the superior OLED panel is only a $90 up charge. Never order the 250 nit panel
I have this exact same laptop. Loved it for a while, but will absolutely freeze to the point of having to restart to fix when running Adobe/or even just too much at once. Battery life? AWFUL it’s nothing. It’s like 3 hours. And it now will not turn on. Waiting to see what that’s all about and if it can be fixed. Oh well. Thoughts on a better Windows running laptop under $1,000??
Review was good, but you skipped the real part. You didn&#39;t go over the digital drawing aspect part. That would have helped your viewers a lot. If you do any 2 in 1 review, just remember to complete the digital art aspect of touch laptops. That is the soul of any 2 in 1.

The MS One Note is so good in this.
do you know the actualdimensions of the keyboard, like the distance from a to l keys?
Great review
Hp envy is mid range laptop

Hello, I bought this computer and I am not satisfied with the battery of the computer itself because &quot;I feel&quot; that it quickly discharges, I have an example at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUwXNBOnjf8&amp;t=11m35s">11:35</a> I had 74% of battery after approximately an hour at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUwXNBOnjf8&amp;t=12m41s">12:41</a> I had 49% and before they asked me the use I was giving it was a few simple searches on google.<br><br>So i dont no what do about thia situation
Yeah, shit mine is a 250nits too.


You watch one piece 🙌🏽

I thought the latest version of this came with AMD Ryzen processor not an intel 5i, considering this review was posted 6days ago I’m a tad confused 🤔


"FOR ALL PEOPLE
<br>This laptop is a complete scam. I bought it just to do 3D rendering and light work and I was completely disappointed since it broke after 6 months of use and now I have to use it with the charger because if it doesn&#39;t turn off, its battery won&#39;t The touch does not work either, apart from the terrible quality, do not buy HP, buy a lenovo thinkpad and it works perfectly, I do not recommend it at all"

How long before the poorly designed hinges break the screen?
Great review! I truly don&#39;t understand why so many of these supposedly &quot;premium&quot; laptops in this price range have a 250 nit 45% NTSC display. I&#39;ve looked through Best Buy, Costco, and Microcenter and the vast majority of non-gaming laptops in the ~$1000 range have the same garbage display. It&#39;s incredibly irritating honestly.

Great review. I unfortunately got this laptop and have been extremely disappointed by it and am looking to return it. People really shouldn&#39;t disregard what you say about the display, it&#39;s complete garbage, and in my opinion ruins the entire laptop. Basically, if you have any display that&#39;s better than it, the display&#39;s poor quality becomes extremely obvious. Everything looks so washed out on it that even watching YouTube isn&#39;t a great experience. The $200 Chromebook I got 6 years ago is brighter and has less glare than this $1000 HP Envy x360. They do sell a 400-nit 100% sRGB model on HP&#39;s website, but the issue is that it costs extra to get it, especially if you pay the extra ~$200 for HP&#39;s extended warranty (which I&#39;d recommend, since HP&#39;s laptops aren&#39;t noted for their durability).<br><br>It&#39;s basically what you said, a display like this has no business being on a &quot;premium&quot; laptop. The only way a display this bad would be acceptable is if it was on some cheap &lt;$400 laptop.
This not the one bestbuy has. Theirs have the 12th gen i7 evo processor in it. Its hard to find a video with that one.


Sir, what do you think about Asus vivobook pro 15.6 <br>I only watch movies and I think OLED is so good for that but I&#39;m scared from burn In thing
I think you can customize the display on HP
During order select the option for OLED screen upgrade with an addition $90.
Is the HP pavilion 14 a good laptop for university students
Great review, in depth and to the point. Loved the Lays chips reference 😆. Keep it up ☺️

Thank you for the review!!!

Can someone confirm if the pen does come in box for all envy 2022 models (even when buying from best buy?)




I just want to mention that I bought the Envy 2022 back on July and is a little bit different from the model you&#39;re describing, the ports available are different and also came with face recognition instead of a  fingerprint reader

There’s a version with thunderbolt 4 charging with 90 watt charger.
Thank you. HP displays are terrible. The only thing I like about their laptops is their wi-fi cards are about the only ones that actually work in my room. Can you please review the Huawei Matebook 14s i7?


Great review!!! Thank you

Amazing videography!<br><br>❤❤
Please make a review on Dell Vostro 5620 Laptop, Intel i5-1240P

the dy branded laptop looks very good 👍🏻✨
Wait, your laptop came with a pen? Mine did not.
👆🏿 👆🏿 Contact him for any difficulty
hey....just wanted to let you know that God loves you so much that He sent His son, Jesus, to die on a cross (because we have sinned) so that you wouldn&#39;t have to die and suffer. The only way for us to be forgiven for our sins was to send His perfect son to die. He did that because of His grace and His love for us, so don&#39;t hesitate to turn to your Saviour, Jesus, turn from sin and give your whole heart to Him, so that you can tap into that salvation
i love this  pc ❤💓💖
Does it come with the pen or did u buy it individually

Hey, great video! do you know if this laptop run games like thesims,gta,genshin impact ecc..with decent graphics? Thank you

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AzxbzGJ6NE&amp;t=3m01s">3:01</a> not speakers
I just bought this laptop from Best Buy and I didn’t get a pen with it?

That pen looks kinda like apple pencil 2. That’s improvement compared to previous 2021 version. Correct me if I’m wrong, I’m confused a little bit.<br>It’s awesome review btw ✌️👍
Thanks for review can u please tell me if it&#39;s storage and ram are expandable...🙂


Maybe you need to change sensitivity of your pen? Could you tell me it it&#39;s possible? Bc I&#39;m thinking about paying this laptop! Also is it possible to write with your hand on screen or do you need to keep it in air?

Hello! <br>I have a question about the laptop that I bought, “HP ENVY x360 Convert 13-ay1034no”. I wonder about how to turn off the hp pen.

Where did you ordered this? Can you share the link?

Don&#39;t get it, the screen flex means the screen will inevitably pop out. It&#39;s happened to me twice with the bottom right corner with two different Envys. Look up hp Envy screen popping out.


Hi I have a spectre x360 16 which has the same loud fans problem, how did you fix it, great video btw!


In these 3 months, have you often used the stylus or touchscreen?


love the vibes of this review. wish more reviews were like this. it&#39;s calm and slow and really makes you feel as if you&#39;re exploring the laptop yourself :D
nice video <br>im frome Pakistan
BEST LAPTOP IN 2022<br><a href="https://youtu.be/qGiTHJNmgEo">https://youtu.be/qGiTHJNmgEo</a>
Could you find a better pen?

i&#39;m having the same problem about the laptop heating up and making a lot of noice, mine&#39;s brand new (got it today) so. how did you manage to solve it? please, tell me!!


good sister
Is this laptop doesn&#39;t support palm rejection?

This is a proper Laptop Wdm, you literally ignoring all the great stuff and the unbelievable price, you can get an IPad and use for your studies if you wish, but keep this bad boy, it was 100% worth every penny, no Laptop offers that many GBs, Ports, Display, Design, Ram, with less than $900, some people get Mac for 1000+, and don’t even get half of what this Laptop offers, plus at least you have a pen weather perfect or not, you can sign documents on your Laptop and do much more important stuff with it.

Can it handle games??

Is this good for video editing in premiere pro ?

Hey! I would recommend you to buy HP Spectre x360 i have 13.3 inch model and its perfect.. screen sometimes freezes but its not a big issue.. Pen works perfectly fine but the real concern is overheating... it overheats on performance mode and it can make your lap a lava.. if you select comfort mode the fan starts making noise so i don&#39;t know if you would like but the laptop is perfect for me for everyday use.. it&#39;s a premium laptop with diamond cut design and hinges and also good.



I wanted to buy this laptop but after seeing your review about pen ,I won&#39;t buy it




Thanks for your honestly and great review.
Hellp dear friend i have some questions<br>1. Is it possible to retouch photos in pbotoshop by using that pen?<br>2. The screen is like mirror and you can see yourself even when screen is on, dont you have problem with that?

I actually plan to buy this and I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve watched your video!! Pretty good vlog!! :)👍✨ How is the quality of the pen?


Anyung haseyo from the US, and thank you for your video on the HP Envy X360. I bought one today, but the model (15-ew0023dx) is a little different than yours. I am retired, so I will use my new laptop primarily for basic photo editing, Internet browsing, and word processing (I enjoy typing, but I have never tried using a pen--looks difficult!). Your video was interesting and presentation was good, also has relaxing sound. Thank you again and I hope you will enjoy making art with your Envy! A personal note, I was in military in Korea for one year, 32 years ago. 😬 I lived in Songtan, but worked at Suwon. I cannot recall if I drove to Gongju, but I do remember Korea was beautiful, people were kind, and--of course--kalbi is always delicious. 😋 I hope you are enjoying your summer with your Envy~

Where did you bought this one

are you sure about the display brightness of 1000nits? that&#39;s insanely bright compare to even the most premium laptop out there..
Hp makes good quality laptops

Is it upgradeable? Can you add SSD or ram ?


Is there a place on the laptop where you can store the stylus?😅

how is the battery for u?

not 2022 model this is 2020-2021 model
When you were filming this Linn, Did you do it with privacy screen enabled or disabled? I noticed a darkening around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AzxbzGJ6NE&amp;t=4m38s">4:38</a> in the bottom right corner and colour artifacts on the top right corner. I&#39;m not sure if this is because Privacy screen was enabled or it was filimed at some angle or maybe even when privacy screen is disabled and it is viewed straight on, it still has a bad light distribution.

I bought the same laptop but it is overheating a lot. It is brand new still it is overheating. I enabled fans from BIOS it didn&#39;t help. I hate HP now. 😢  Should have gone for MacBook Air.


you should buy lenovo yoga instead...

Hey Lin. Thanks for pointing out the stylus. That is also my concern. I&#39;m still deciding between this and acer spin 3 because the screen and stylus. I think I will get the spin 3 model even yjo it wont be as beauty as this. <br><br>I think also the problem is not on the pen but latency? pls share ur experience when u got new pen :) great vlog btw





Great video<br>Be aware of the hinge connection defect from HP. Your screen might break in the next few months. <br>Refer to the following video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3UxRZdvg0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=re3UxRZdvg0</a>

Nice video! However I have a question, what app did u use to take note using that pen?


For the palm issue, I think artist glove would help ^_^

we have same laptop...sadly mine does not have a pen in the box and it only is a base model with i5 1155G7


how did you solve the heating issue?




How your experience with Envy X360 is good for computer engineering students to used different Programming software is there is any lacking to used heavy software tell me I Also to want Envy X360

Thanks for sharing the content. That must&#39;ve been expensive.


Hello! Did you notice any bothering fan noises while using this laptop? I’m looking for one that is very quiet. Thank you in advance! :D

Thanks for the review. It was amateur but at least honest and real test (not like some pro reviews that are often paid by companies to promote the product ^^). So, good job!


Where did you buy it?





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AzxbzGJ6NE&amp;t=3m01s">3:01</a>  Those aren&#39;t the speakers. Those are vents along with the bottom grill. Speakers are at the front bottom corners.

Great vid. Love the music. What&#39;s the name of the song instrumental that starts when you&#39;re picking up the box package?


Did you bought any new pen if yes how was the experience because I am willing to buy a 2 in 1 laptop for digital note making I need to know how this 2 in 1 perform in real world with respect to note making .. THANKYOU

How hot and loud did the laptop get after some use? Would it be comfortable to place it on your lap for a certain period of time?

Could you try to draw in Blender 2d grease pencil with it?

Price

❤💞💞💞❤

Great product with pen 👍👍👍❤️

Maybe try placing a matte screen protector? Like one of those paper like type screen protector

I the Envy but I&#39;m confused how he has a Ryzen 5-4500U whereas mine has the Ryzen 5-5600U
can i use one of those digital pencils on it?
Two years ago my wife bought the envy 360 partly based on this video. It was an all right laptop. It had some issues with the WiFi card and keyboard, but they were things that always went away. <br><br>A few days ago, seemingly out of nowhere, the laptop screen stopped coming on with the power button. Indicator lights are on, fans come on, but it never seems to actually boot. <br><br>Googling of this issue makes it seem somewhat common. Possibly a power issue with the battery. Given how many posts there are about this, it seems like something hp should stand behind, but I see no evidence of that. We&#39;re going to email HP and see if there is a solution. <br><br>This is a two year old video, but if you guys read this and have some suggestions, we would appreciate it!
This video aged like fine wine

he has the older version now i think. in 2022 i think it has definitely has undergone some changes. It comes with a stylus which actually works and a comfortable keyboard. BEST gaming laptop if you are &gt;18.
good thing i bought it but I will sell it that thing has a hinge fault
Can anyone help guide me to use the port? I can&#39;t insert the USB type C into the port?

I bought this laptop about a week ago and here is my review: <br><br>The laptop is simply good compared to my Dell XPS 13 9360 (late 2017)<br>I couldn&#39;t have picked a better laptop for the price. <br><br>There is little fan noise sometimes comes up when doing a heavier work. <br>For gaming I play Rimworld with no fans and issues. <br><br>I do wish the screen was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> but that&#39;s not major issue if you are specially using a dual monitor. <br><br>I recommend this laptop. <br><br>I will be installing Fortnite, Warzone and playing and reviewing Rimworld ... if you have games you would like to see with this laptop let me know

There was literally a sale on easter that dropped the price to $611 for the envy 15&quot;. On Best Buy.
Wowowow
Coming back here after buying this laptop in 2020. It has been a horrible experience. Mine arrived with broken speakers, and over time (with little use because of the broken speakers, mind you) the pen somehow lost a button and the wifi chip is dying and no longer functions without dropping out.<br><br>Usability is poor and wasn&#39;t thought out. No led lights up to tell you the machine is asleep instead of shut down, guaranteeing unintentional battery drain. The power button and fingerprint reader being on the keyboard means you cannot power on, wake, or unlock the laptop without unfolding it from tent or tablet mode. There is a num pad, but no num lock led, or software indicator for it. VRAM is allocated to system memory, and never raises above 512MB, despite stating it does so dynamically; this laptop will not run any 3d games at any settings. HP still hasn&#39;t listed Windows 11 drivers on their site (still shows only 10), drivers in general haven&#39;t seen updates in almost a year, and I&#39;m pretty sure the BIOS that&#39;s 7 months old isn&#39;t safe to use anymore. Worst $1000 I ever spent.
Just got the 15&quot; version with the Ryzen 7 5700u for my birthday, and it performs pretty good from what I&#39;ve experienced so far
it ran valorant at 60 fps and it ran paladins at 80 fps. this is my favorite and only laptop.

what about upgradability ?
Lots of talk about Apple Mac, Dell, and Lenovo. Check the world wide sales statistics for laptops for the last 20 years. It&#39;s all HP.
him : $800 its soo cheap<br>me: struggle to buy a laptop over $200
Ryzen 5 257gb or i5 512gb? 🤔
I&#39;m at that phase where my old laptop is dying and I am confused if I should continue with Windows or go to MacBook Air M1.

Does amd ryzen 7 hangs
I have a HP Envy X360 2-in-1 convertible ( the 13.3 inch 2020 model ) and it is a dream for a student.<br>I am a biology student and this year I&#39;ll be a teacher.
Ok.. now all I need is the money 😶
just got it for $3,147 so far so good, was it a good price?
can you use the type c port as display output for extended monitors?
My gosh AMD is on 🔥
Can I get free laptop ?
Can you upgrade the Ram on the 8G ram to 16G?
even the envy 360 comes with a pen now

Thanks! My dad had one of these lying around for work, and my laptop died. Life-Saver knowing this is a good laptop!!!!
always thought intel was better here since there is only 8gb of ram
first time with amd, ryzen 5 4500u radeon graphics, and im really impressed.
And that screen is to nice to use in tablet mode
screen to glossy and mirror like for me
instead of saying &quot;whats a Segway&quot; say &quot;whats our sponsor&quot;
Make a video about why we should buy intel configuration
That Lenovo flex 4 really takes the word “flex” to a whole new level.
Its almost perfect, but here&#39;s the thing: 13.3 in looks to small for me, but 15.6 in is wayyyy to big for a 2 in 1 in my opinion, so a 14 in version would be AMAZING
I&#39;m think of getting the hp x360 ryezen 7 but it&#39;s only 13 inches its so small compared to my giant gingers
I&#39;ve been interested in buying the Laptop for school and even bought it. Everything is PERFECT about it, but my only regret is getting the 8GB RAM version. In Canada, the 16GB RAM version is $400 more expensive... Other than that, I recommend it!





is it good for drawing
We don’t need battery life.We need performance ✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻.( even though who will by a cheap and slowest laptop and pc 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️).

Yea I have the same envy laptop and I knew it was a good run for your money when you can run fallout 4 at 60 FPS without a fricking gpu
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m52s">6:52</a> I’ve got baby hands
I own a hp Envy x360 amd ryzen 5. And to tell people like me who is a student.. this will do you just a great job in studying in 2021 to 2022 or even 2023..... it is even great for light gaming ..watching netflix or crunchy roll.... price wise it&#39;s great..and school wise  i can do documents, pdf, power point and zoom plus i can use its backlight when my light is off in my room..so its a productive laptop for me.
Here I am again on another “AMD trashes Intel once again” video while watching it on an Intel laptop
Bro. If ur comparing cpus, pls use the name of cpus in the graphs u show.
I bought it for 699
&quot;Making the jump to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>&quot;? What like in the mid 00s? Lol. Guess we&#39;re jumping back in time. Also surprised that one guy&#39;s little hands had an issue, also that he called them &quot;giant&quot; 😂😂. Ssssuuurrree.
Love the shade he threw on Macs when he says &quot;turns out you can put USB-A ports on a super-thin laptop&quot; XD
I can’t find this laptop anywhere
Is it true that HP AMD or HP AMD Ryzen consumes &gt;2GB of RAM for system usage. In my case a 16GB laptop shows only 13.9GB? HP support wasnt very helpful giving a proper reason or documentation. Is this true on other HP AMDs or AMDs or .. ?
aaaaaahhhhh the &quot;segue&quot; joke, it never ages
how they got 14 hrs i have this laptop i get 2-3 hrs of normal use
I as a Linux user personally and professionally, I am really enjoying using AMD, thanks to the Open Source drivers, it works very well
I really like this computer!
almost 1 year later, I&#39;m still waiting for that acer swift 3 review 😒
They are really getting their money&#39;s worth out of the probe lens.
I love mine. i have the 17&quot;
Finally intel got it&#39;s competitor now hope that intel have to get best processors at best price
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=2m35s">2:35</a><br>How is that even possible? Mine gets literally half what the Intel one does. You must have mislabeled your graphs.
Sooo just BUY NEEW HANDS!! Lol jk
Normal Envy 13/14 with discreet graphics is little beast of a machine.
Everyone gangsta til Linus forgets what a Segway is
Anybody notice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m57s">7:57</a>??<br>See what they did there
I&#39;m sitting on an Envy x360 with the Ryzen 7 4700U and it&#39;s the best purchase i&#39;ve ever made
it might be weird to ask questions in comments, but i just bought an hp 15s-eq1017 with a ryzen 5 4500u 8gb ram, 512GB SSD, i know that this model is a not the best when it comes t quality, what&#39;s ur opinion guys????
What about ryzen 7 4700u (Acer swift 3)
He has always gotten sponcers.
Lol, I got the Envy X360 at Best buy for $580 because it was on sale for 100 dollars off and you could get another 100 dollars off if you were a student.
No offence but the envy 13X360 looks somewhat like a mini omen 😝😂
HEY LINUS!<br>Please review the Acer Swift 3... it rocks! In fact, the intel version is more expensive and not as fast as the AMD Ryzen 5 one!
You are soooooo freaaakkking helpful
The pricing of Intel CPUs just never made any sense, sometimes double the money for maybe 20% faster.
At this point, AMD will catch up to Apple&#39;s M1 before intel does.
I am buying this


Have you reviewed the HP Envy x360 FHD IPS 14 or 15” RYZEN 7 4700U
Great review, thank you.
review the dell g5 15 se
since when is 16:9 a bad aspect ratio?????
I need a computer Linus tech. Please... I won World of Tanks top 2000 tankers for Fury on a intel duel core pentium and 4 gigs of ram brother... I still have the computr &amp; have broke 3 other laptops screens THAT have broke just like the intel pentium 1 I need a lop top,,,   just pick a fair 1 out ....    please send me a cheap lap top from 1 gamer 2 another PLEASE BRO.....

a <b>&quot;casual&quot;</b> $1800 laptop
&quot;uncomfortable for males&quot;<br><b>*laughs in surface go*</b>
Buy this only if you&#39;re okay with rolling the dice on a high rate of hinge failure in the first year or two and don&#39;t mind that HP doesn&#39;t cover it in their warranty.
Hp laptop sucks ass.
I just want to say, we have 14 of these. 9 have now overheated to the point they&#39;ve been physically damaged and been returned to HP for repair.
16:9 is the best aspect ratio, most videos are on 16:9. If only i could find a 16:9 new SMARTPHONE.
imagine amd phones...lol
That segue was terrible, ngl. Usually, they&#39;re pretty good but that was just bad and lazy.
i only come here for the quality segways
How do you compare this one with the Lenovo Ideapad Slim 7 or Lenovo Flex 5 14&quot; with the Ryzen 7 4700? Overall Price/Battery Life/Performance and that will keep you happy for a while.
I had the HP Envyx360 for 4 months until last week when the screen and bezel detached as a manufacturing defect. My particular device was riddled with issues, notably, the Bang &amp; Olufson speakers were awful since half the time they would just stop/start working at any given point. My biggest disappointment was the battery life. I ALWAYS had the laptop on batter saving mode, and it would last me no more than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=5m30s">5:30</a> hours on casual use (using word processors, and having between 2-5 chrome tabs open at a time). Overall, I was disappointed, and I am using the refund and a top-up of a few more £100s to get something from the XPS series instead. I hope that other HP Envy x360s aren&#39;t like this, but it&#39;s been enough to make me steer clear from the model.

I got the envy x360  for game designs  and it was phenomenal
I have hp envy x360
Asus ruined ryzen with zenbook lpddr ram
All the Envy complaints could have been solved by the 15.6” model.  And you get a numpad then!
The European version has a full sized keyboard
Hey man, just to bring to your attention, I bought the envy x360 (India) and got a defective piece, they rejected a replacement when I demanded it in December, ignoring the tilted hinge, problematic headphone jack and other defects. It&#39;s been 4 months of use and laptop lags while using chrome. Just CHROME. Now the hinge connector got loose, and it shattered the screen when I was closing the laptop. They&#39;re now asking me to pay a price (under warranty under 4 months of use) for a goddamn hinge replacement. Hp customer support sucks (at least in India). Being a student the laptop&#39;s price was a premium and now I&#39;ve to pay more for this. If someone from hp is reading this comment please help me out



Better laptop now for 540 anytime not a sale
lmao my broken country has put this laptop with this config the exact same price as the base hp omen 15 with r5 4600h and gtx 1650ti
HP<br><br>(herbert Placard)<br><br>Makes the best laptops.
Summary: todays sponsor is amd ryzen
Does the envy have pen Support?

I’d like to see how this compares to the M1 MBA.
Here&#39;s a list that helped me out.<br>&quot;<a href="http://whinyl.com/laptop-guide/">whinyl.com/laptop-guide/</a><br>In the end, I went with #2.<br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=3m02s">3:02</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=1m02s">1:02</a> did u just rename it from hewlett pakkard to herbert placard(i mean hp&#39;s full-form)??!
If amd gets its hand on thunderbolt it&#39;s all over for Intel
If you can, Please make a video on tiger lake vs amd now.<br><br>Thanks all different videos, it helped many people buy good laptops.
i have HP ENVY X360 13 4500U<br>IT ALSO RUNS GREAT GAMES
As an artist and a gamer, that HP Envy laptop just might be destined for me! Seems to have all the specs I want and is just under $1k.
yo has linus been working out
Just bought this, I&#39;m pretty blown away. I&#39;ll get an SSD upgrade and I&#39;m good. Just wish they put 16 GB RAM inside but oh well...
So I have a question for anybody who wants to answer it. Do you think that this laptop could do some light audio editing in audacity for podcasting?
Using an Acer Swift 3 with a Ryzen 5 4500U and it&#39;s an amazing lightweight laptop with a good battery life...that can actually game.
Hey Linus, What about the upgradability of this unit?? (SSD and RAM)
Honestly I got the 15 inch version with a Ryzen 4700 U a few months ago and to anyone considering purchasing one, I&#39;d say go for it! I was able to get mine from Costco for under 1000$ and it came with a pen and a USB C hub and have been happy ever since



Cool, however in my country amd laptops are actually way more expensive than the intel ones...<br><br><br>Plus there are like 5 brands which actually sell amd laptops here lol (the cheapest being the asus tuf a15 which has massive heating issues as I heard)<br><br>Plus laptops cost way more in general in Europe than in the US<br><br>A 1000$ laptop could easily cost 1200$ here<br><br><br>So I&#39;m actually satisfied with my i5-10300h + gtx 1650 ti asus g512li since even with a discount it wasn&#39;t cheap
You speak of a beautiful past my friend
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=5m14s">5:14</a> When they called that laptop &quot;Flex&quot;, they <b>meant</b> it.
‘...albeit barely’ 😂 oy, that merch advertising. Good undies, sudden butt view not expected. Good to hear my beloved old AMD is doing well.
I&#39;ve got the 2018 version of this laptop and mine has a type C USB charge port on the right hand side, have they removed it?<br><br>As for the screen there is a common problem with the left hinge becoming stuck which happened to me busted my screen opening it.
Only older generation people still think intel is better than AMD.
oh my God
WARNING: NEVER EVER BUY AMD LAPTOP WITHOUT AN NVIDIA GRAPHICS CARD!!!!!! THEIR GRAPHICS DRIVER IS GARBAGE VERY UNSTABLE BLACK SCREEN WHEN OPEN AND CLOSE THE LID, BLACK SCREEN WHEN WAKE UP FROM SLEEP, BLACK SCREEN FROM BASICALLY EVERYTHING. THEIR CPU IS GREAT BUT THEIR GRAPHICS DRIVER IS AN ABOMINATION. 20 YEARS OF USING INTEL LAPTOP WITH EITHER INTEL iGPU OR NVIDIA I NEVER ENCOUNTER THESE PROBLEMS BIGGEST MISTAKE IN MY LIFE!!!
They are now selling the envy with a stylus. Atleast for the 15 inch model.
Thanks for the review. I got the 15&quot; top spec version for $600 on Black Friday yesterday. It seems like a fantastic little machine for small tasks while if I&#39;m traveling (If that ever happens again). I have no intention of using it over my desktop but it seems capable enough for such a low price point.
Going to surprise my mom with one of these for Christmas. Replacing her 10 yr old toshiba i3 lol

Those links dont take you to the specific laptop youre talking about
I know nothing about amd, all about intel
Compare it to like the i5 1135G4 not the i5 1035G4

Does Hp spectre x360 comes with AMD processor????


Just picked one up at local best buy open box for 560. It was Nothing but the laptop. That said for what I saved i got a universal charger, carrying bag, corsair wireless mouse, and a smart stylus. Totalling 720 usd.
Just gotten this laptop and its the best latop I ever own. Color is great, keyboard great, full aluminium build, 13&quot; portability, great price, fantastic battery life and lastly convertable to tablet mode? fantastic! the only complain for me is the tablet sleep mode, there is a bug that you have to turn it back on by pressing on the power button which you have to flip back to laptop mode to do so after that the keyboard becomes abit haywire. my workaround is to just set the screen to always on with black screen saver lol. Other then this annoying problem which have no upright solution i would highly reccomend this laptop.

WOW!
does the envy laptop has backlit keyboard?

Don&#39;t buy this laptop unless they fix the audio driver problems. My sister and many others are experiencing audio being cut off and the microphone no longer being recognised for zoom calls and other com apps.
the all laptops and macbook are too much expensive in india :( :(  :(
Hp envy rysen 5 x360 or hp envy x360 i7? I&#39;m buying one tommorow for my bday but don&#39;t know for sure which processor between the two
I love that my ancient 1920×1200 display is actually getting <b>more</b> support now than it used to. There was a prolonged period where I had to settle for black bars or stretching in various games, but now <b>high end</b> laptop displays are bringing back that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> gaming support.

Imma get some stickers in 5 years so I can afford it
I see a lot of trouble for intel in the coming years. Apple will move to silicon and most pc computers are moving to AMD
You often talk about numbers. But to our human eyes, how much is faster?
DO video with apple with AMD vs apple with intel CPU chip comarision. Do as below <a href="http://video.do/">video.Do</a> more comparison  videos AMD VS INTEL .INTE LHD GRAPHICS VS AMD GRAPHICS .
Wish oems are listening but they have big support from Intel r&amp;d. Unless AMD could increased the performance by maybe at least 20% in gaming (I know, a pipe dream) than any Intel mobile cpu in the future laptop it might change their mind to sell more amd laptops. However, for now oems are not interested in making super premium laptops with amd apu/cpu regardless of better performance in productivity. Even with better gaming performance as we know, oems are still not interested with ryzen 4000. They already prepare for tigerlake apu. So, I don&#39;t expect this is going to change anytime soon. Only DIY is where AMD is good.
I’s it bad when it heats up rendering
But they are always out of stock
Sir Asus TUF f505Dt Intel i5 9th Gen Vs Ryzen 5 3550H which is better one ,, and give more battery life ?
HP envy line looks great on the surface...except for one things. If the battery reaches 0...it never lives again! I have sent mine in for repair got it back for 2 weeks and it died again! ..now waiting a full month to just get a replacement. Maybe just my unit...but HP support sucks! Highly don&#39;t recommend the HP envy!

Nice.
You love to see it

Ive noticed that most of the issues that Linus had with the laptop are only on the newer models, my envy came with a pen, has windows hello, the older model also has a larger bottom bezel.
I have been using Envy for a month now and you know what? I can play Witcher 3 in 30 frames on medium settings

Only problem with ryzen processors is overheating but if you are used to it as i am then get amd


where is the TUF A17 at?
AMD keeps scamming people with gimmicks. For benchmarking ultra books people run the benchmark with AC power connected and then publish the results. Then they don&#39;t run any benchmark while on battery test. AMD ryzen 7 4800U actually performs really bad on battery to save power, but Intel laptop CPUs have roughly the same performance on ac or on battery. AMD claims great battery life by tuning down the cpu while running on battery. I would like to see the laptop cpu benchmarks AMD vs Intel while both are running on battery power. Performance per watt AMD is not even near ice lake and not to mention tiger lake.
How strong are the guys who work at Linus Tech Tips? I was watching this on my Envy x360 and tried to bend the damn thing like they were, but got nowhere close lmao
Lol
Intel is way better dumby
I&#39;m so glad I chose the 15&#39;6 inch version of this laptop and I&#39;m watching this review on the laptop. I&#39;m liking it so far and this review just helped validate my opinion. Glad I made the right choice

Can I install ubuntu on it ?

Which one should I buy hp envy x360 intel or AMD one...?
Linus, do you like the HP x360 Envy or the Lenovo Flex 5 (both with 4500U processor)?

Have you tried the thinkpad e14 gen 2
I bought this exact laptop, the envy x360.  Turns out it has a serious audio defect that crashes during live meetings when using built in mic and speakers.  It’s going back to HP for repairs for the second time, and they told me they will surely fix it this time.  Processor is amazing, but the pc is worthless if it can’t video chat on it in 2020.
But it is hard to find Amd laptops in my country. I live in Dubai
First time I see him with a decent haircut
Is it just me or is the 13.3&quot; one that they reviewed impossible to find now? I&#39;ve seen tons and tons of 15.6&quot; ones but I can&#39;t find this one :(

Linus. please stick with this hairstyle.
It&#39;s hard when the actual price is 700$, but in my fucking country it&#39;s 1000$!!

Review Lenovo flex 5 current amazon best seller
I thought this would be a video talking about amd laptops in general but somehow it&#39;s become a review of the Envy x360 lol.<br><br><br><br><br>Not that that&#39;s a bad thing tho.
Longer battery you said?

They gimped the 6 and 8 core AMD models by shipping only a 250 nit display available. FUUUU
I&#39;ve just ordered the Ryzen 7 version with the 1000nits screen as a replacement for my Galaxy Tab S4 that I just dropped on the floor. Perfect timing!


What’s the difference with the 15 inch version? I just bought the 15 version with the 4500u cpu somehow it was cheaper than the 13 inch version?



Could somebody help me, are those mobile Ryzens (3rd or 4th gen) work well with Photoshop? (Not super-heavy work, just photo-editing).<br>Like, is GPU acceleration working fine? And so on.<br><br>I cannot seem to find info on that anywhere (except for just ONE obscure post on AMD website where person says he got terrible lags in Photoshop specifically)<br>Have anyone actually used it and could share his experience?

In India we don&#39;t have good laptops options.
16g of ram  model costs 1100$  and the Lenovo you get it for 660
Would I be able to use it for video editing? Maybe 5 min 1080p videos
I7 &gt; ryzen 5 (I usually see them compared with a lot of models, but the i7 is still a bit better than ryzen 5 on average)


Mom I want a dq laptop
Only thing that annoys me is 8GB of ram, 16GB is literally €50..
Thanks linus, Picked this up for about 800$ and it works great for my size 8 hands.<br><br>Also it also works well with Ms Surface pen.<br><br>The only irritation i have had with it is that i cannot easily log-inn when using it as a tablet. And no way to awaken the device if it went to sleep without converting it back to a laptop first (if you dont a a pen to awaken it with).
Intel: Outside<br>AMD: Inside!!
Yup, but I can&#39;t get it in the flagship laptops I want.
Amd:Faster, better battery life and cheaper<br>Brands: ye and also out of stock lmao









Linus: I am gonna ride on this AMD badboy
wish it had a thunderbolt port but I know that&#39;s not happening anytime soon so
Holy shit the envy is good
AMD Ryzen laptop mobile 4000 series  are so good. it beats Intel not only in mobile but also Intel desktop cpu. My Mechrevo Code01 running R7 4800H beats the i9 9900 in cinebench.
Personally I’ve been trying to find a good yet low cost laptop with such an aspect ratio for a while now. I HATE squarish screens with all my heart. Thanks HP
I &quot;upgraded&quot; from a 4th gen i5 laptop to a current Ryzen 7 laptop...an HP Elitebook...and what can I say. It fuckin sucks. Runs really hot making it noisy (even when just browsing the internet)...battery life is about equal despite larger battery capacity and the graphics drivers from AMD are the worst.<br><br>Yeah peak performance is unbeatable for the money but everything else is equal or worse. I&#39;ll stick with Intel next time...

Lenovo with AMD: hahaha, that&#39;s what you think.
Costco had the 13 inch model with a 512 ssd, 8gb of RAM and an amd ryzen 7 for 750 bucks. Wild.
If i buy ryzen 4500u will i able to do 1080p editing and photoshop..and productive work!
Maybe the keyboard and trackpad issue won&#39;t exist in 15 inch version
my 3500U beats the i5 here
Why can&#39;t I find this laptop anywhere? There is no 13&quot; with Ryzen 5. Only Ryzen 3 or Ryzen 7
Just noticed that watching video on it have a good amount of motion blur ...dang it i wanted to like it but motion blur just ruins it for me
It seem like now you can only buy the envy x360 with a ryzen 7 4700u for 1k :(
Me this laptop is a bit overkill for what I need it for<br><br>Also me it looks sexy tho
Hi I bought the hp envy 360 ryzen 4500 and noticed the touchpad has a gap on one <a href="http://side.is/">side.Is</a> this normal!!
AMD Ryzen the wonder of decade.
Is this laptop better than a MacBook Air? <br>I’m look for a laptop for school but idk what to get

Please find out a way to use Sidecar on PC for the next video...
thunderbolt 3 though :S<br>not that it matters to everyone. but it does for me....
Big caveat from a Linux guy: the pipe and backslash |\ key is mapped onto the L key with some weird meta combination guesswork! Big big no no for me and the only reason I returned this beautiful machine. That&#39;s pretty much every command screwed up in bash lol
You know what the actual problem is? Major manufacturers are still shipping Intel on their laptops. Entry level laptops don&#39;t even bother giving an AMD alternative.
What about the 15&quot;? The keyboard and trackpad is bigger and has more ports and is less than 850 on Amazon
Please forget to make charging with USB-C 3 happen - it doesn&#39;t work over time when you <b>really</b> use your laptop. It just sucks and is error-prone.
&quot;Herbert Placard&quot; ,  LOL !
When you say you&#39;ll have to enable performance mode you just mean the windows battery-icon-click-slider thing, right?<br><br>Great video by the way! I was able to get a 32gb ram / 1tb model from newegg and got it based on your recommendation! I was dying for a well reviewed and customizable ryzen laptop and this price was pretty incredible.
I wonder who actually buys LTT underwear.<br>Do they do a strip search of LTT employees to see if they wear LTT underwear? Lol<br>“Are those Armani underwear you’re wearing? TRAITOR!”

AMD made a deal with the devil
I need a 1TB SSD at least, otherwise I&#39;m not sold.
You got 1400 points in cinebench while it shot up to 100 degrees and stayed there? I can set my 4500u to just 10 watts, enjoy very manageable thermals and it still scores higher at 1600 points. Pretty incredible chip.
wheres your video card at mate
Is it the ryzen 5 or 7 that will give you 11 to 13sh hours of battery use. Thanks!
Got this pc just today... And coming from an 4 year old Lenovo.. oh my gosh!!! This pc is amazing! Speed, sound quality, touchscreen, style, and the price too! I can even game &quot;quite well&quot; on it. Love AMD Ryzen 4000.<br>Got the 500gb model for 700€








Just bought one of these on HP&#39;s site. For anyone in the market you can now get the 15in version of this with 16GB of ram and a 512GB M.2 for under $800. If you want to upgrade to the 4700u 8 core cpu add another $110.  Takes a couple weeks to arrive but either are a great deal.

Watching this from my new HP Envy x360 13, with the AMD Ryzen 7 4700u processor. Honestly, watching this video made me 100% sure that I want this (rather than a MacBook, surface or other laptop). I use my laptop for heavy multitasking and research and I can&#39;t, no matter how hard I try, slow this laptop down with tabs and PDFs haha. Thank you very much - excellent review (that actually made life easier for me)! :)
it doesn&#39;t have an ethernet jack so unusable for any serious work
Does it run well w linux on it? Looking to boot fedora on it
I bought one of these for my son with the 4700u, 16GB RAM, and 512GB drive, and by far, this is the best laptop you can get for the money. Excellent laptop.


Good practical review 👍
I already saw this review 2 times. Now that I have the laptop I rewatched it 3 times back to back, and agreeing with the conclusion.
When i go to preorder the envy its a broken link. lmao. HP what are you doin?
The x360 trackpad I seen displayed at costco was off center to the left... is there a different model?
Too bad intel pretty much bribed laptop manufacturers to only put the higher end gpus in laptops with intel cpus. Recently bought a gaming laptop and the only way you can get anything over a 2060 max q was to get a laptop with an intel cpu. On top of this laptops with intel also have significantly slower ram. I hope intel either gets slapped with enormous fines that they are forced to stop their bullshit or amd shits on them so hard that they completely go under, i am so sick of being FORCED to get intel chips that not only run ridiculously hot but are severely underpowered for the cost. Nvidia is pretty much the exact same way tbh, i can&#39;t wait until amd goes at them as hard as they are going after intel on the cpu side because i am so sick of both intel and nvidia&#39;s overpriced bullshit that more often than not we have no choice but to get.
What the heII is the &quot;tiny hands&quot; comment supposed to mean?
Hi guys, dose HP&#39;s fan still have the noisy sound like apatche.
Interesting how laptop monitors evolved from 4:3 (actually, the usual aspect ratio of CRT monitors) to 8:5 (also called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>), then 16:9 which is the usual format for TV and video. Now the evolution goes the opposite way, with 2 in 1 laptop-tablet hybrids being impractical with aspect ratio too wide.
I have amd i bought yesterday msi bravo 15 ryzen 5 worst screen graphics
Who else got a Intel Core i5 Ad before this?<br><br><b>Lol</b>
So, does HP make good laptops now? They had a very bad reputation some time ago.
I&#39;m using Ryzen 7 on HP convertible laptop, it surprisingly like using ARM processor but little more heat
Can the Ram be upgrade ? How many ramslots are free ?
what the best laptop cost 1000usd please comment
I im getting the 8gb 4500u with 512gb ssd for ₹75k or $1000 with ms office 19 and mpp2.0 pen included, is it fairly priced ?
A question to which I cant find an answer anywhere online: &quot;How loud are the fans when used NORMALY and how hot the thing is when used NORMALY???&quot; <br><br>Also, how good the hindge is on these laptops? And I want an answer to this from someone who used these kind of devices DAILY for months!!!

In Vietnam it&#39;s $1060. :(
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m30s">6:30</a> Ask all the people that think anything other than 16:9 and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> is disgusting what is their opinion on that topic. I would agree that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> is better but 3:2 is straight-up disgusting!
Just bought a 16gb 1tb ssd envy x360 with ryzen 7 4700U for $1100, probably one of the best purchases I&#39;ve ever made
So I&#39;m still really confused. In which areas does Intel and AMD deliver respectively? And which is REALLY overall much better?

Proudly watching from my Envyx360
It&#39;s literally a sponsorship people!!!
Thanks for putting the name of the laptop in the title. Oh wait, you didn&#39;t...
Just ordered this from amazon because of this recommendation

Faster, cheaper, better battery, not available anywhere
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m05s">6:05</a> Start of Only fans content.
I’ve been using the envy x360 for about a month now and it’s been the best laptop I’ve ever had. I only paid $550 for mine.
hello Linus HOw are you?
Why not the 4700u... 😒
Nice to see this as HP employ
Linus, could you veryfiy if RAM speed has such a great influence on AMD Ryzen performance? I leave link below:<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSy8zx_2UdI&amp;t=186s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSy8zx_2UdI&amp;t=186s</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=5m00s">5:00</a> are you using that unsually long lens that mkbhd showed a while back???
nice video 😜 😂
Hi, Linus. Thanks for the lovely review. Pray tell - since you do a lot of custom builds, I have a challenge for you - Figure out a way to manually install LTE into a laptop that did not originally have it and show us how to DIY it...

Made the big investement in the ROG Zephyrus back when the first Ryzen 7 / 9 laptops where released - promisse did NOT hold up, battery is empty after 3h (in potato mode and 50% screen brightness) and it feels rough, sluggish, strange hangs and hickups, unpleasant fan, tons of driver issues with the RTX 2060 (CUDA), not remotely close to Ryzen desktop experience. Doing a lot with virtualisation, due to Intels better technology on this part, there&#39;s practically no speed difference between my 4800HS and my i5 8250U in virtual machines. And they soldered one DIMM and that way limited it to 24GB. Very limited i/o, screen is a joke colorwise, HD only, no touch but &quot;awesome&quot; 120Hz. For the first time I&#39;m not happy with your recommendations, Linus. This was way too pricey in Europe and bought in a rush cause of (seemingly artifical) low availability. Whish I could return it, this will hurt me a while. Hope you guys make better choices.
Actually bought this after this review (typing this on it now!) - so far, very impressed. The tablet mode basically replaced my iPad for entertainment and for work - it blazes through office tasks and I&#39;ve even used Premiere Pro on it a little, I definitely wouldn&#39;t use it as my primary editing machine, but for starting an edit on the go, it&#39;s solid and having the USB-C port is a great boon there. <br>Honestly, not having used a higher aspect ratio, it doesn&#39;t bother me in anyway and I guess my hands must be on the smaller side as I found the keyboard very comfortable and the keys are nice and give a nice little tactile bump at the bottom of the key press!









Yo his hands are massive 👀
I&#39;m confused between Ryzen 5 3500u and i5 9th gen wch one is better
I like the form factor of the HP envy 360.  But I heard a rumor that Apple is going to release a MacBook with Apple Silicon for $800., with one USB-type C port and a 4th gen butterfly keyboard. And I would rather get the MacBook with Apple Silicon inside.
you can get the 15.6&#39;&#39;  512gb ssd version at costco for 899.99 with the pen
I just wish there were more diverse options for mobile Ryzen. So many companies still don’t use it (like Apple).
The funny thing is in the end HP is using AMD products.
intel is over
By the way, great video!
Now I know how updated the video is, thanks to Linus&#39;s beard ...
I just got the Lenovo Flex 5 81X20001US and I love it for $869.00 it is faster than I expected and for under $1000 this thing is awesome!!!!. The only thing I did is get a $15 intel AX200 wifi 6 card for it.
I managed to get  two of these hp envy x360 r5 config.on sale recently for $832 a piece for my kids to home school. This price included 2 year accident coverage.<br><br>Really good machines.

I have the x360 2019, and in the refurbished market, I got mine for a cool £600 with warranty. It is basically the same apart from no drop down usb a (it is only slightly thicker, so it has the same io as the 2020), and has a top firing speaker at the top of the keyboard, and a larger bottom bezzle to accomidate that. the Ryzen 5 3500U is quad core at 3.7 boost (same as the spectre 2020 ... wow) so the performance is in the same ball park. The 2020 brings smaller bottom bezzle, and the 4000 series processors. I cannot reccomend the 2019 version enough, as it has all the features of a much pricer laptop at half the price.<br><br>the keys are firm, and the complaints about the keyboard palm rest are nit valid for me, and I have medium sized hands for the UK male. the touchscreen is really useful, but I never seem to use it in tablet mode - but that is a personal preference. I have noticed that you have to put it in battery optimisation mode in windows on battery power for the battery life to be good, but then I run it on max brightness, and when I put it down to 75% brightness, the battery life is awesome. <br><br>I am a student, so my budget was modest, and to have a premium laptop is awesome - and the only other feasable laptop for this price would be a pavilion 14, or a dell latitude  -and those are all plastic. as a student, I have no regrets at all with this laptop, and it is snappy for my word processing workflow. the speakers are very good, but I found that you need to go into the bang and olufsen sound settings and give it a bit more bass - and then it is good. It is worth noting that it actually has 6gb of useable RAM as the APU uses 2gb for graphics memory. this isn&#39;t a problem for mobile workloads, as I would have 10 chrome tabs open with video conferencing for the online schooling, and it is fine - I don&#39;t think that it is a problem. <br><br>For gaming, I manage around 30 fps in e-sports (World of Warships) games on low - medium, but I believe that the 2020 model has a more powerful gpu, but 30fps is console frame-rates anywho, so I don&#39;t mind. I don&#39;t really game on this too much, as I mostly use my iPad for that. <br><br>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENVY X360 SERIES<br><br>Hey Linus, I know that you read through around half of the comments, so there is a good chance that you will see this: I would just like to say that you are one of the most hard-working people on this platform, and you should be really proud of the company you have made!



Okay, buying!!! Unless someone has another suggestion? For me it&#39;s just productivity and wanting to feel joy shoving it into a bag. I also like HP customer support, when you get a bad laptop and it breaks repeatedly and is a known issue with some skus they will. Replace it.... For this reason I will also never buy asus because there&#39;s a good chance you get stuck with a very unportable... Portable.
This isss my whooollle weekend! Omg I laughed way to hard at that.
Lol just bought this last week with  ryzen 7 version because it’s comes with 512gd. Before I ever seen this video. It’s great 💪🏽
What model is he reviewing in the video?  why are the sponsored links just searches rather than direct to the product we can buy?   frustrating.
The HP Envy x360 is about 2400 dollars in my country 🧐
So, how do we get the free sticker pack? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m22s">4:22</a>
Well, I should&#39;ve went all out with AMD..
You should check out the Mechrevo Code01. Around the same price as the HP. But with faster CPU, Removable Ram, Better display, larger battery and also lighter.
Having a 2018 2nd Gen Ryzen envy x360 with Arch Linux, I&#39;m amazed on the performance I get for gaming on this machine considering it basically has only 8GB RAM total (using 2GB VRAM and 6GB regular).
You had me excited there for a moment with the claim that many are moving to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> screens. I checked and of course it&#39;s not for desktops.
What about the speakers?
For me personally amds CPU success is good news since they are also at least competitive in the gpu side as well compared to intel. Im a simple guy so i like to keep things in one brand instead of multiple brands so that each pc components can deliver a more efficient performance potential and synergized experience
I bought ASUS vivobook S14 m433IA. I had to pay a little more because I had to buy from authorized importer and not from ASUS directly so there was taxes and stuff. If you people are looking for a premium metal build with AMD ryzen 5 4500u, 512 PCIe nvme SSD and 8gb ram check it out.
hp support said you can charge the base unit over usb-c. are they telling the truth, or theyre just guessing?
nice segway.
You should have said &quot;Cheaper Better Faster Battery&quot; in the title
"I can say that this laptop is beast!<br>I have been using it for over a month now (MKBHD style :D) and it&#39;s amazing in everything.<br>I have Windows 10 along side with Linux Ubuntu 20.04 installed on it, and as usual the performance is much better on Linux compared to Windows<br>Check this Geekbench5 score on Ubuntu<br>Single: 1230

The new Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 has a Ryzen 7 AMD 4700U for only $800 and it games!
Is gaming viable or should I go for the zephyrus g14

For real. As a tech enthusiast I am really grateful to AMD. Intel, for so long, had been monopolising the chipset market. Now all we need is an alternative to Nvidia.

Can we add more Ram in hp envy ×360 2020 model?
i bought a chinese laptop 4800H without any GPU, so it uses both cooling to cool the 4800H, PBO unlimited at 65w
When I see gameplay videos of Cities Skylines, a very CPU-intensive game that needs at least 4 cores to perform well, I see that Ryzen CPUs outperforms Intel everytime. I wonder if all the benchmark sites out there are biased and bought by Intel to say Intels are better, because when I look at practical real-life examples I see Ryzens performing better everytime. Thoughts?
Anyone visiting South America soon? I need to buy one of these more powerful laptops for work and gaming and I&#39;m astonished with the import taxes here. Please let me know if you&#39;re coming here, bring a laptop with you, I will pay you USD 200 bonus on top of the price of the machine for the shipment and hassle costs. There&#39;s some killer Lenovos for sale right now at Newegg and I can&#39;t take advantage ot it, kills me on the inside, holy fuck. It would be cheaper for me to take a flight abroad and bring one laptop with me than to buy it at stores over here. Thanks again, socialist governments! Much appreciated!<br>On top of what I said above, there&#39;s not nearly as many models to choose from over here, so I&#39;m basically paying more for not being able to choose what I want.
Review the Lenovo Yoga 13 in (730)
Too bad they don&#39;t have Thunderbolt!
Got this laptop recently, everything was amazing until the microphone stopped working. Had to return the whole unit, and I waited about 20 days for HP to ship it to me because I customized a unit. The AMD processor was so fast with 16 GB of RAM. Now I am settling with my new Samsung Galaxy Book Flex Alpha. Still a great laptop, but man it was such a bummer that my HP Envy x360 microphone had stop working. Anyone else experience issues with their HP Envy x360?
I work in pc sales. Love the envy love ryzen. So bloody great a product. Easy to sell and it makes happy customers

Hey it is a Request, btw thank you for the great Video and Would you do a Performance comparison on these Budget gaming laptops. ALL AMD(DELL G5 SE). AMD(4800H)+NVIDIA(1660Ti)(TUFA15, keep the base open xD), INTEL(1070H)+NVIDIA(1660Ti)(DELL G5 2020) , idk if there is INTEL + RYZEN. It will also help us understand how well the  CPU AND GPU interact. You are free to chose any laptops for any scenarios that match the Processor and GPU.
Please consider reviewing new &quot;KDE Slimbook&quot; (AMD Ryzen 4800H with everything optimized for linux. But this time it is not System76.) ... Anthony will like it.<br><a href="https://slimbook.es/en/store/slimbook-kde">https://slimbook.es/en/store/slimbook-kde</a>

I use a Ryzen 2000 APU HP Envy x360 for school already. Guess I upgrading is upon me, wether I like it or not...
Shocking how there so so few ultrabooks running the 4000 series ryzens..<br><br>Almost blasphemous. But hey if I wanted a new ultrabook, there is little else that meets the price, performance and battery expectations as well.
intel:wait, that&#39;s illegal
Let&#39;s not kid ourselves, you&#39;re watching this video for the segment at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m02s">6:02</a>
Linus, can u do a xps 17 review
AMD is pissing on Intel’s grave
Can you upgrade the ram in this laptop to 16 ram ???
I&#39;d like to see how Dells Inspiron 14 2-in-1 7405 with the 4500u stacks up to this laptop in performance. I know the Dell trades off screen brightness and battery life but it may have better build quality than even this HP.  Worth a look????!!!!
Is there any aspect where Intel excels like in editing software like Adobe? Parts availability? Motherboard? Long life?





<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m03s">6:03</a> fack my eyes...
Just ordered mine yesterday! I got the 13” with AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD


Those Close up shots 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🙏😢  I have an i5
Ryzen is not longger battery life
AMD sure has come a long way just to take back the crown from Intel
hackintoshable and full adobe family suites compatible is more important, not a bit
I loved it when laptops, and then desktops switched from the 4:3 to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> ratio. Then when, due to the influence of HD TVs, the computer industry decided to go to a 16:9 ratio, I said, &#39;Nooo! just because it works for movies doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s as good for computing as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>! The sweet spot is either <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>, or maybe even better, 3:2! Now, finally the industry is figuring this out and switching back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> or even using 3:2. It only took around ten years for them to figure it out.
Played this on my phone speaker. My dog immediately wakes up and walks away.
Imagine a Spectre with the 4800u. Now that&#39;s something I&#39;d get
You are paid by intel
Hey guys, do you know what HP mean with AMD?<br>You guessed it!!! High Performance!!!<br>(⌐■-■)
Don&#39;t buy iPhones, buy a laptop, play games, don&#39;t regret! <br>(⌐■-■)
Intel sells in these high price   laptop because indians don&#39;t know that amd is getting better than intel, they think that intel is better and the people at stores suggest them intel devices
too bad there&#39;s only like TEN of them. Jesus...
Intel 2016: We are better in benchmarks and gaming!<br>Intel 2017-2018: We&#39;re better in gaming!<br>Intel 2019: We&#39;re still better in laptops!<br>Intel 2020: Can you just buy it, please? We&#39;re really struggling here.
Hey btw this laptop is on sale on the HP website
Cheapest laptop for smooth 8k video editing, any suggestion mate ?
I just wish the Ryzen gaming laptops had more than just a base 2060. That is the only thing keeping me from buying one of the new Ryzen laptops.
got a 3500u laptop this year. WIsh I&#39;d waited for 4500u
we had no other choice but to stan amd. intel sweetie you&#39;re canceled!
Anyone else think there is way too much LTT store in recent videos?
Amazon link doesn&#39;t work for the envy 13.3 x360
OMG I love DY!
I found a Lenovo flex with ryzen 7 4700U on Costco for $1000 CAD, seems like a good deal
Intel Getting karma for squishing money out of their consumer and also for their evil marketing tactics
Shopping for an amazing gaming laptop is so confusing.<br>Was leaning on new Helios 300 but then there is legion.<br>Help!!


It may be faster, but is it ARK max graphics fast or just fast?
Intel be like, &quot;aright time to make call&quot;
Better title : Why Intel Still Exists? !!
How much ram can you add to that?
i just bought the HP envy ryzen 7 4700u 8c/8t 512GB ssd and 8gb ram 3200mhz for $700!!!! YES! $700!!!
I have the 15 inch envy and I freaking love it. Its the perfect laptop.


welp thx guys this is what im gunna buy my chick shes got a i3 and it takes 12 minutes to load up. thanks again
Linux tests please!<br>HP hardware is notorious for not running properly in Linux.<br>(Also, the Zephyrus too is barely functional in Linux, and I need Linux for my workflow)
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m48s">6:48</a> -- seriously? you just grabbed the biggest guy in the room (who made that terrible G3 iMac video) to complain about this laptop not fitting his massive hands?! Sorry not every laptop in the world is not a massive 16&quot; laptop with gigantic palm rests!!! Some of us like the smaller size of these laptops... it&#39;s a selling point, not a set back.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m22s">0:22</a> I really don&#39;t like this logo.
Is nobody talking about the missing right ctrl key?
Intel is irrelevant now. I am gonna sell my ZenBook UX430UAR. It was my first laptop but the battery life wasn&#39;t great, the CPU (i7-8550U) regularly hit 90c and doing some benchmarks of a bespoke multi-threaded Java application, it was over 2x slower than my R7-3700X  with the same number of threads and that&#39;s despite the laptop being on maximum performance mode on a cooling pad and plugged in.
This guy is so fanatic for amd lol
Im using the HP envy x360 from last gen. I has not got the latest Ryzen chip in it, but its similar to the one reviewd in the video. <br>I just wanted to adress the Keyboard part, because I have huge hands and got used to the keybaord fairly quickly.
Ah yes the Envy X360, Of the original Ryzen laptops the Envy is a classic. But its incredibly flawed as a machine
Hey! What components of the HP Envy laptop here can we upgrade? I checked a lot online but did not find a definitive answer if RAM is upgradeable or not.
Wait, why is 16x10 better than 16x9? We used to consider that a drawback, now it&#39;s a feature? 16x9 is the aspect ratio of TV now. Anything will have black bands, and won&#39;t necessarily have natively supported resolutions when gaming.

While watching your videos, I couldn’t help but be amazed of how your channel easily cemented itself as a household name here in the Philippines. I mean, nearly most of the YouTube Tech reviewers in the Philippines knows you and is a big fan yours. Your review has always been concise and easily understandable from a super techy person to a newbie techy person like me. Thank you for always bringing good content. Love from the Philippines. 🇵🇭

AMD ftw
Shut up
Linus - Do you know if the HP Envy X360 has its memory and/or SSD soldered in?
Meanwhile intel compared a laptop with an i7 to a 3950x in price and fps including a 1080 at 1400 MHz compared to a 1080 1100mhz...
Would the SSD be replaceable in the HP X360?
Unfortunately, HP still uses the barrel power connector even on their EliteBook lineup, which are premium-grade business machines.
Oh no Linus made a video on it. Now I won’t be able to find it in stock anymore
AMD in XPS 15 when?
Still waiting on Linus to finally just join the Red Army
ok but does it have two ram slots?
Jon Snow might know nuthin&#39; but even he is showing up for AMD
I just purchased this 13&quot; Envy x360 and I can confirm that it does come with an active pen.
16:9 screens are much cheaper. Like 2-4 times cheaper than other aspect ratios. So makes sense for cheaper product line,


Can we just take a moment to appreciate the close up shots?
Yall should do a video comparing Ryzen 7 vs Ryzen 5 in this platform!
No wired LAN port
OK, I choose Apple Silicon.
I always chuckle when Linus hosts a video sponsored by <a href="http://drop.com/">drop.com</a>
Attn: Costco shoppers... at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m26s">6:26</a>, the Acer Swift 3 Ryzen 4500U version shown for $629 at Acer Store is $599 at Costco right now, same spec as listed here but equipped with a 512GB NVMe SSD.  I bought one -- it&#39;s terrific.  This is a basic laptop, i.e. not touchscreen and not &quot;2-in-1,&quot; but it&#39;s a great value; ruggedly built, slim, light and fast.
amazon only got 15&quot; model available. is the 13&quot; model even out to be purchased?
Yep. My dad who worked at Intel as the whole CPU Area manager until 1/2 a year ago even agrees.
Lenovo Flex 14 was aptly named for sure
Would all points made in this review still be true for the Envy 360 15.6 inch?
It&#39;s great to see you making reviews on budget laptops. Make more videos on cheap(comparatively)  and good laptops like this. We trust your reviews and it helps very much. keep it up bro
Anyone watching this video after watching &quot;Does Intel WANT everyone to hate them?&quot; video


Envy what a name🤯 can’t wait to see notebook named greed 😂😂😂


8GB of RAM in 2020....thats a great amount of RAM!........NOT.
Could we see a Windows Surface Book with AMD processors 👀
How would this handle with an external monitor?
Bought one! (writing this comment from an HP Envy x360 4700U 8gb) Thank you Linus.
Could you test it with Linux on it please? Would be interesting to see the differences and what works and what doesn&#39;t. Thanks for this video, will probably be getting this laptop :)
Linus&#39;s favourite word: <b>segue</b>
My first laptop was hp it was great
Spot on about the battery life. I charge my AMD laptop half as much usually, sometimes only once a week, and I use it daily for light desktop and office apps.
Oh you missed it Linus, Arm is the answer
AMD is like the kid everyone doubted in the beginning then started throwing hands.




















😀 I have the HP ENVY x360 with ryzen 4500....and let me tell you thats its an absolute beast and battery life is amazing. Ryzen is killing it big time. I got it for $575 at best buy. They had a special 2 weeks ago.
I remember when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> was the norm after we moved from 4:3. It feels odd to be talking of moving to it from 16:9.
It&#39;s amazing how many people got scammed into buying inferior AMD chips haha!
amd laptop cpus have come so far
Finally
Intel: you win I give up<br>AMD: I&#39;m coming after you now Nvidia





























Those b-roll from that small long lense are just amazing...
&quot;I personally didn&#39;t have an issue with my tiny hands&quot; - Linus, 2020
just picked one up from best buy for $820 with the 4700U, 256 ssd, and 8gb ram <br>now my laptop has a faster cpu than my desktop, 1800x gang
I wouldn&#39;t want anything other than 16:9
I saw aegon targaryen!!! 🥺
When are these laptops coming to india😭

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m18s">4:18</a>
Intel is a curse nowadays, ah how the have turned, which is nice.
Got my HP Probook 445R G6 with ryzen 5 and radeon vega 8, very pleased. Long battery life and very decent performance for a laptop. This is actually my first AMD computer, might even consider a threadripper for my desktop.
I don’t understand why done LTT start a laptop or PC company because they literally know everything about them and how good everything is.

Shut up AMD&#39;S son
If there is an AMD laptop with Thunderbolt 3 port, I would definitely buy one. I know it sounds crazy to have an Intel idea on a rival&#39;s product, but I&#39;m seriously favouring Ryzen CPU chipset now. The only reason I stay with Intel is because of Thunderbolt 3. Because of that feature, I see no more importance of having a gaming rig in my home. Everything is now done with my Dell Latitude tablet via a portable eGPU enclosure.
I have a Zephyrus G15 (the 15&quot; one) and I can confirm it&#39;s way better than an intel based laptop of the same price.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m00s">6:00</a>   I couldnt tell were Linus ended and the back drop started.......
AMD is the best !!!
What envy model are you guys buying? I recently bought a envy x360 with a ryzen 7 4700u but the monitor is so trash. it&#39;s 250 nits and the screen is yellow. red looks orange and greens look like puke. please help this. this is the one i bought 15M-EE0023DX edit: 45% NTSC

That all changes In 2 months
Hey would you recommend this for editing 1080p videos on the go?

In Costco Canada it’s 1100 which Is 800usd and it has ryzen 7 4700u 1tb ssd
the envy looks better
An AMD chip not being the hottest thing around is a sign of the end times. The cycles begin anew..
you can see if a strange device joins your wifi, and bLaAhCk it instantly.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=2m45s">2:45</a> guess we can make jokes that intel gets hot as fuck  and then goes 💥💥💥💥
Intel really are in trouble.
So you pay $250 dollars less and get more 🧐, NOICE
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m30s">4:30</a> linus looks at notes
Linus: We will not be comparing three Envy to the XPS 13 today. <br><br>Also Linus: Compares it to the XPS 13.


1 month ago: I need that Zeferus 14<br><br>Now: I need the Envy x360

IDK what LTT did, but we got vastly different results with temps. <br><br>On idle, the Envy gets hot within 15 minutes, throwing off a lot of hot air and making the frame concerningly hot to the touch. Definitely uncomfortable to rest your palm on.  Brand new, demo mode, idle at 50-60C.<br><br>The Spectre gets pretty warm as well, but not uncomfortable to use. Idle at 40-50C. Also Linus fails to mention for $250 more you get a 4k OLED display.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> is making a comeback? That was an aspect ratio I last used with my 1920x1200 LCD monitor back in 2007. What is wrong with 16:9? It is the standard.





You always put Intel down n put AMD above them but you like When they send you free products why even bother with Intel then if you don&#39;t like there products 💯

I&#39;m gonna buy the hl envy but there are 2 versions and there is a huge price difference. So whats the difference between the 13-ag0035au and the 13-ar0118au
Wouldn&#39;t a device that logs in via fingerprint that has your fingerprints all over the screen and keyboard by definition be insecure?!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m38s">7:38</a> Why does he look like he hasn&#39;t showered in a week or just ran a marathon? Or did he just shower? What do they do before taping that makes him look like a sweaty mess?!
I see that Brandon has gotten his hands on that probe macro lens that everyone&#39;s been talking about.
gotta love the guy fake typeing lol he was giving it everything hes got lol <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m28s">7:28</a>
I can&#39;t find the envy 16gb version in my country, is 8 gb enough? <br>Sadly ram is soldered so to get tge 16gb the only option is to either wait (but hp was dodgy on when and IF that configuration is coming in the near future) or buy one from outside my country and replace the keys...

So I was looking for a new laptop and saw this review and how well it preforms, checked other videos on it pulled the trigger the same day this video came out, also it is on sale for 579.99 on <a href="http://bestbuy.com/">bestbuy.com</a> in the US. So far the keyboard issue isn&#39;t bad for me I have tinier hands then most males. I&#39;m still getting used to the layout though as my old laptop was smaller,  I have done light photo editing on it and it works well. It seems to be pretty good epically for the sale price right now.
I use a wireless mouse. Trackpads infuriate me. Heck &#39;em.
That fucking segway...mint👌
What about the new ryzen ripper  pro that Lenovo lunch yesterday vs the Mac pro?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=9m33s">9:33</a> Drop(dot)com should sponsor Linus in every video
&quot;Now it looks like HP hopes to recreate that success...&quot;<br><b>OOHH</b> I wanna know what he thinks of the new Omen 15!!!<br>&quot;...with the Envy x360.&quot;<br>Oh. Nevermind.
I really hope AMD just kill A series and start producing more Athlon U series on the lower end.
Yooo those macro shots on the laptop are super clean
I think amd doesnt know what cheap meaning is anymore
bruh i just ordered an hp spectre x360
Switched to AMD since middle last year and dont think I will be switching back to Intel. As well as AMD supporting Linux much better than Nvidia and Intel, especially with Linux gaming getting so much better and my daily driver is Linux for home and work, I prefer AMD these days.
I wish we could&#39;ve gotten hardware this good before Windows 10....
Can anyone confirm if this laptop supports Windows Ink or not? This would be awesome for drawing AND light gaming if it did.
I bought this computer. Loved it. Except enabling virtualization in the BIOS caused the device to randomly restart whenever it fell asleep. Probably a problem with nested virtualization support for AMD chips, which supposedly Microsoft fixed last month.
14+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++will never end😏🤣🤣
Anyone know if the 400 nits screen can be overclocked?
I was taught that the correct way to type was with your wrists hovering above the surface. My wrists are actually more relaxed that way. So keep in mind that in that 68%, there&#39;s a bunch of us for which that stat is entirely irrelevant.
Thank you YouTube for just now telling me this was uploaded
But can it run crysis?
Hey Linus, I&#39;m considering building a custom computer with some vary taxing software in mind.<br>Is it possible to find an affordable rig that doesn&#39;t have weak points?
Its a shame it doesnt go up to 16gb... i need it for my workload
Hey guys what you think of this a video about it maybe <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/former-mac-boss-predicts-pc-makers-will-have-to-dump-amd-and-intel-to-go-arm/">https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamer.com/amp/former-mac-boss-predicts-pc-makers-will-have-to-dump-amd-and-intel-to-go-arm/</a>
I have that Envy but with a AMD Ryzen 5 2500 2.1GZ and 15 in. It&#39;s a great laptop but it does get hot quickly and the battery life is mediocre.
And I bought the 2018 Version of the envy 😭
Personally I&#39;d ether get Ryzen 3 or chromebook. I really don&#39;t need much for mobile stuff
So,...what ur saying is there&#39;s no reason to buy a Spectre?!?
i got an envy x360 in 2018 with a ryzen 5 2500u and have been perfectly happy with it.  it even has windows hello facial recognition.
Thats where i think ryzen belongs to from the beginning, because of efficiency, NOTEBOOKS!<br>Same goes however to the RX 5000 gpus.... the desktop ones are pretty bad, but the notebook ones are performing ok (for notebooks...), but the main advantage is very nice efficency, so AMD finally made gaming on battery enjoyable.

Any info when are laptops from any manufacturer with 4xxx  ryzen series processors coming into Europe? I have been looking in my region for a while now and still nothing :\
I can&#39;t really recommend HP Laptops because of their atrocious keyboard quality. <br>I had an Envy aq0005ng and 3 months in use the keyboard finish started to scratch off. I sent it in and HP told me it was &quot;my fault and not within the warranty&quot; and I had to pay for a new keyboard or just live with it.<br>3 months in use and the finish starts to wear off? yeah no thanks HP.
And amd lacks smt 6c6t config.<br>Damn big OOOOOOOOF
Oh... i remember <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> back in 2008, its still alive?
Is it just me or did the production quality increase a bit more on LTT vids
that boys got some fat fingers
yoga slim 7..
I wasnt sure on the exact size of the laptop, thankfully there was a banana for scale. @<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m58s">7:58</a>
Both are demonstrated with windows os. Mehhh...
well played HP
Intel is really shiting in their pants right now
Next laptop will be a Amd lap
lenovo flex pad 14in &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>ryzen 7 4700U, 16gb ram, 516GB ssd  ----- all for $1030 CAD or $760 USD ( price from Costc0 )<br><br>if you&#39;re not picky about screen coloring, this is definitely #1 option
What is the point of changing titles?
To be honest I am bias against HP due to a long history of bad reputation when it comes to durability, reliability and such in my old school circles... but I really don&#39;t know how that brand fares today.<br>My first laptop was a Toshiba from 2007 and it is still alive to this day, it was built like a tank, but today Toshiba doesn&#39;t hold the same rep.<br>My second laptop was an Asus from 2011 which was also a brand with a good rep for the price, and it is still today my secondary laptop, but the display is completely broken, so I use it as a desktop.<br>I currently have a Surface Book from 2016 and that thing has been the most fun laptop I&#39;ve own. It has had its fare of issues, however most have been corrected by software upgrades, and the hardware problems are not what you would expect from a 2K device, however I will stay with the line due to its versatility and overall experience. Also my wife has a Surface Laptop 2, so it&#39;s nice to have compatibility at home for things like the Surface connector, the Surface Pen, etc...
amd would have never made ryzen if intel honored the original decade long contract they made with amd, intel created one of its greatest enemies, standing alongside arm holdings
Great timing on the video, because I need to get a laptop in this range :)




i press links doesnt even show laptop hes showing
I just got the 15.6 inch one with the same specs and it was only $650 so it&#39;s awesome for my sons school computer
I got an ad by linus before the vid
I have an envy with a ryzen 3xxx I got last year for school. Judging from this video the quality went down? My IO seems way better and it&#39;s a no flex aluminum frame. The thermals could be better and it suffocates in tablet mode, but damn is it a sleek laptop. I now look and Intel chip laptops the way I looked at amd 5 years ago. Intel stock price drop when? Gimmee that Lisa Su Everest curve!
too bad its hp and therefore disqualified for purchase
Intel has a better durability and they are more powerful,  you guys comparing an i3 with an ryzen 9 , just comparing with up or i7 or even i5 , these are pretty good , i love intel
Stuck between this laptop with the r4700 16gb ram or the same spec Lenovo ideapad 5 14...
Beside Linus, all of the laptos reviews, who uses 14&quot; display
JFC - &quot;This is my whole weekend&quot; had me dying! lmao
I still refuse to own any kind of AMD products. Intel is still my 1#
Stop already AMD!<br>Intel is already dead!
great AMD CPU i want One  👍✔😃 Regards from Europe from my Channel Bro&#39;s  👍
so i haft to throw out my entire latop just cuz its got a intel inside
If 2020 me told 2017 me that AMD would be the better platform on both laptops and desktops, I would have sent him to a mental asylum
i see someone got the loawa macro probe ;)
Does anyone know why there&#39;s so few 4900hs laptops around? I want something like the G14 but more business minded.
I see what u doin there. Tryin to involve other people in videos. The thing is.. Linus without Linus is not Linus! U cant quit on us! Dont even think about it :)
To the person who is making the subtitles in Spanish, thank you very much
I have a lenovo notebook with a r3 3200u inside for 250 euro and was blown away <br>you can play with bluetooth controller enabled local multiplayer games like Rocket league etc at 60 fps mid for up to 3 hours <br><br>the lower end keyboards became really good too ( had a pentium B960 notebook from asus since 2011 until know) but the trackpad feels a little flimsy (I guess corners had to be cut)
linus grows a beard to make us think that his balls dropped
Linus I love you!!!<br>I finally found the exact friggin laptop I needed and was searching all my life, thanks a lot man<br>I&#39;m going for the 15 inch of this version and I&#39;m so fkin excited yayyyyyyy😍😍😍😍


In short, AMD has taken command. &quot;Period&quot;

По мне так AMD лучше в плане цена-производительность. intel сильно  завышает цены на свою продукцию .
These reviews are always worthless adds. Who gives 2 shits about screen wobble, who&#39;s typing for 8 hours on a laptop keyboard without access to a wrist rest or an actual keyboard. These are all data points with little to no correlation to actual use of the device. And all of this after Linus&#39;s big cry video where he&#39;s looking for purpose in life. How about starting to inform as to what is actually useful instead of going through the same outdated 3 things (&quot;screen wobble&quot;, &quot;deck flex&quot;, &quot;typing experience&quot;) and slapping the amazon links in the description. You do realize the only ones watching these are people who generally can&#39;t afford this stuff anyway? And also, you&#39;re not quirky, you&#39;re autistic.
my mom got an envy x360 with everything the same besides the screen being 15.6, for 579.99

bro im ngl that segue caught me off guard
Hi
I&#39;ll trade you my 13 year old HP TX1200eo for that HP Envy. It also has AMD inside, and a flippable screen. :)
Too bad HP laptops (at least all the ones I&#39;ve used) are total shit. From the budget lines up to the &quot;expensive&quot; ones. HP has left too sour of a taste in my mouth to recommend their products to anyone.

Intel hasn&#39;t been the only option for decades. While AMD was almost always out performed by Intel... AMD always had solid performance all while being drastically cheaper than Intel. Do i want to spend $500 more dollars on an Intel CPU for 6-10% better performance I won&#39;t notice only benchmarks will??? Nahhhhhhhhhhh!
can i upgrade ram and ssd on the 15 inch x360 (after i already have it)?
I remember when touch pads were barely big enough for 2 fingers
Hey Linus, when are you restocking the black &amp; gold waterbottle on LTTStore? You can take my money once it&#39;s stocked. Kthanx.
Pls watch the verge pc build tutorial its a nightmare<br><br><br><br>How we built a 2000$ custom gaming pc

Standing in his underwaer talking about brightness <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hero">#hero</a>
can we put core i3 8 generation in 2 generation motherboard
WHEN WILL THEN NEXT ROG RIG REEBOT BE CONDUCTED
I actually own this computer and I can confirm that this computer is a beast this thing can do anything you through at it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=9m33s">9:33</a> I didn&#39;t get the $20 off when signing up. Can someone help?
i have the lenovo 5 15 with the same cpu. bought it for 600€. Its the best you can buy for now in laptops. Ist faster than intel equivalents, it needs less power and its cheaper.
I just got a Linus ad for Pulseway before this video... He&#39;s everywhere!!!
👌👌👌👌
Why keep complaining about the screen being on 16:9 aspect ratio ? I like it personally since most Youtube contents are 16:9 ,  most consumer monitors are 16:9 . I hate my Surface Pro because of the 3:2 screen ratio because contents are not made for that resolution .

But the question is &#39;Can we run 10 chrome tabs at once?&#39;
<a href="https://youtu.be/_R5YxqzEsJs">https://youtu.be/_R5YxqzEsJs</a> <br><br>Check this out Linus , a comparison between Amd ryzen5 3600 and Amd Ryzen 7 3700x
I’m gonna tell you something that will shock you. AMD based laptops today are not cheaper then the intel ones. I was just at the store and they are exact same price or more. Stop lying for f sakes. In Canada the prices aren’t cheaper.  Every one of you reviewers have said they are and I was fooled by you til I went to the store. Stop it!!!!!
Cool !
Linus Tech Tips I have and most of my Discords friends for different games like Hunt: showdown and COD: MW, we have noticed shitter PC better online shooter games. They don&#39;t get hit is there something to this to the point that a friend laptop overheats he is hit less as the CPU throttled.
I bought a Lenovo Xiaoxin Pro 13, similiar config, AMD R7-4800U, 16GB, 2.5K display, with just 5,000 RMB ( around 720 USD ), not sure what&#39;s its price on other markets though, for reference.
The 2019 edition with a Ryzen 5 2500U is 1,130 USD in my country :(. The one with Ryzen 3 2500U costs $900 tho, so I can save fot that. And the current gen ones will probably be expensive as hell when adding the shipping taxes on amazon.
When Linus says 100 degrees, he means Celsius? meaning the laptop gets hot enough to boil water?
Ok i want one now
what is smooth?
Am I the only one that cant find a 13 inch model in stock?
Lenovo <b>Flex</b> 14 :)
Feels like a sponsored video. The zephyrus has a graphics card, more ram, a better cpu, and more fps. I wouldn&#39;t spend the cash on either of these hp laptops.
Hidden problem with the ENVY x360: the rubber feet start to fall off.<br>Not really a big deal, and I love my ENVY x360, even if mine has the previous generation Ryzen 5.
Liking for &quot;this is my whole weekend&quot;
did anyone else notice they change the title from should you even consider a intel laptop to AMD laptops -faster,longer batter, and cheaper
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m21s">0:21</a> HP giving Intel a huge middle finger for under delivering on performance and thermals.
Get my like because I dont have heart to give you down vote but is about performance Linus...., laptops you present sucks and for this price you can get better laptop and from Amd and from Intel
Wait a minute.... That&#39;s linus tech tips
wait their ryzen 7 4700U model is at 757$... <a href="https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-envy-x360-laptop-15z-ds100-8wl85av-1">https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-envy-x360-laptop-15z-ds100-8wl85av-1</a><br>edit: you can even get it to 16gb ram and upgrade to wifi 6 and its still 800$. seems like a good deal imo.
Why isn&#39;t review in the title of the video? Cause that&#39;s what this is... a review. This is a good video, but it would be great if you could be upfront with your audience about what they&#39;re about to watch instead of this &quot;clickable&quot; bullshit. Thanks
dont like jarrod&#39;s comment so we can leave it at 512 xD
THAT SEGWAY GOT ME XD
Why are people still buying intel. Amd comes with a stock cooler and is cheaper. The only reason you should get intel is if it’s on sale and cheaper then the processor you want
You forgot to mention the 120hz screen
Hp hinges will fail and you’re out a laptop. Known problem for years
Sounds like the Spectre users are gonna be... Envious
New macro shots look dope 🤘🏽
Linux doesn&#39;t work that well on Ryzen laptops yet AFAIK.<br>Wish someone would build an AMD laptop with a 2070 Super with a mux... ☺
Linus please keep the beard after isolation
*&quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> and 3:2 tall aspect ratios are the here-and-now&quot;<br>*films in superwide aspect ratio, which will have letterbox bars even larger on tall screens than on 16:9s...<br>Are we going to see a return to 4:3 of the CRT days?

Isn&#39;t Andy cute or what? I&#39;m a official Andy fan today.
When you are not sure if you are watching linus or deep fake
Those mircolens shots really butter my eggroll.
Was it really that crazy to want a large bottom bezel for the screen so it adds a little height?<br>This anti-bezel crap is so stupid.
I used to be a intel guy, for really one reason. When I was younger thats all you had. 7 years ago I got my first laptop with a A10 and I just died . Bought a new laptop and built my first computer in 15 years. AMD all the way. Not for the GPU though lol
Love the review. Would be interesting to see other benchmarks done (productivity and / or gaming).
So uh are we bout to ignore <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m03s">6:03</a>
And people ask why apple is ditching intel ;)
I hope intel Goes bankrupt in making consumer chips....
hey linus , there is a bit of video review on your ad
I bought the x360 with a 4700U for about 920€... 1 TB ssd, too.<br><br>Really nice.
But can it play Crysis remastered?
Watching LLT but before that brought to you by pulse wave by linus
Leave the Envy alone!! we love 16:9.. best for resting in plane/car tables plus your 18:9 content would look worse.. Personally I would make Envy wider and Spectre taller.. so that travelers have a choice.
haha get it, lenovo FLEX 14
Look at all these OEM: intel intel intel. Look at the retailers: intel intel intel... <br>Intel is continuously showing how they are the bad guy once you look past the crap.<br>Intel is going full bore with forcing their advertising with all major companies because they know they are losing major ground on all fronts. For example with tech retailers that send you the daily sales email that say &quot;hey look at this new AMD!&quot; yet only show a tiny square for one new mid level 3600XT, and the rest of it is packed with Intel/nvidia... Commercial reviewers are getting especially bad minimizing AMD&#39;s dominance by highlighting Intels &quot;strong&quot; points every chance they get. They spend half their time/space in an AMD product reviews with &quot;yeah but Intel/nvidia does this&quot;, and every Intel review is basically &quot;praise our god Intel&quot;.
They did not killed Spectre, Spectre is profesional product for graphic designers with SUPERIOR stylus technology. It&#39;s like comparing Surface Pro to normal laptop, these products are for different customers.
How would 1080p video editing and a bit fusion 360 feel on this device? (As hobbyist)
Starting to make sense.  Screen is too small, price still too high for my budget, storage is pitiful in terms of capacity and reliability.
Please dont ever again use that doted background for the graphs. Some people can&#39;t look at it, it mighet trigger photosensitive epilepsy - it did for me... Thank you😋<br>Ps. Now i want a new laptop
👏👏👏
im a simple man i see banana for scale i tumbs up

So no excuses this time for Lenovo and their ThinkPad lineup.<br><br>I guess HP will stick the Ryzen 4000 CPUs in their elitebooks as. They used to in the last years
do the new asus rog zephyrus g15 with amd and rtx
I currently have the 15&quot; model. It is an outstanding machine.
Oh god please just give me an XPS13/15 with AMD, or all the other premium brands so there is some compeition there.
Hey Linus, make a video where you take the bargain spec laptops of flagships you review and see how those compare to the one you review and each other in that price bracket. Because realistically speaking, people will still go out and buy dual cores even though quad cores and more are better just because dual cores are cheap, make the video to show how much performance you&#39;re leaving in the table.
To be honest, I have a low-end laptop, I can&#39;t afford much, it&#39;s a Lenovo Ideapad 520, it has a i5 8250u 4 cores 8 threads CPU, 2x4 GB DDR4 ram (one of witch is sodderd), NVIDIA MX150 4GB mobile GPU, 128GB ssd and 1TB of HDD storage, ips display panel 16:9 1080p rez at 60HZ, baterie life, well, 4-5 hours.... But I&#39;ve own it for almost 3 years SSD life it&#39;s at 95% (Hard disk santinela data) and it got me throw the last year of bachelor degree and master degree. It&#39;s built from aluminum I think, in my opinion it has a great keyboard,i play on it light and middle games like CS Go, lol, dota etc and I&#39;m pretty happy with it and it cost me like 650 euros 3 years ago... Not bad imo.
Linus never shave the beard you look amazing <br><br>No homo
ok Imma Buy AMD laptop then
Should I get the nvidia FE or the ASUS GeForce RTX 2080
As long as you don&#39;t get the utter garbage radeon drivers....
Which monitor should I buy <br>1) LG 24GL600 144HZ TN PANEL<br>₹14000 = $ 186<br>2) SAMSUNG LC24RG50 144HZ VA <br>₹16000 = $215
I just got this for 580 bucks!
I totally agree about the aspect ratio. For me, the 16x9 display would be a deal breaker as 16x10 is just better for laptops.
Please give me one of your old rig :&#39;)
Remember when Linus said &quot;there&#39;s a reason companies partner with AMD for their laptops&quot;?
Would you recommend the Envy or the Swift?
Dude only $800 for a Ryzen powered laptop?! Oh it&#39;s only a 13&quot; that&#39;s why it&#39;s cheap.  Bummer.
Envy has much better thermals than Spectre. Take this comparison with a grain of salt.
No Ethernet port ? what ?
I just bought this thanks to linus
So, yall in the comments seem to know more about PC&#39;s than I do. Should I buy or is it worth buying a 2010 High end gaming pc? Not for newer titles, but for CS, GTA 4, R6 and so on? And if, how much do these old PCs cost? Thanks in advance.

Is there any hope that the upcoming spectre 13 will have an amd option?
I picked up the 15&quot; version which fixes a lot of their gripes and has upgradeable memory for under $600    <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-envy-x360-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-nightfall-black/6403441.p?skuId=6403441">https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hp-envy-x360-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-nightfall-black/6403441.p?skuId=6403441</a>
I feel like HP is flippin me off with that logo
what about that sweet HP exclusive BSOD? Is that extra, or comes standard?
So with all this good performance from AMD  CPUs, I have one stupid question. <br><br>Why are laptop makers always as a rule put weaker GPUs in AMD laptop?<br>eg. Laptop with i7 cpu gets 2080rtx gpu, but laptop with ryzen 9 cpu gets 2060 maxq gpu....

THAT BEARD HOLY
Who uses trackpads anyway? &quot;Bluetooth Mouse: enters chat&quot; &quot;Cabled Mouse: enters chat&quot;

I would like an equal core counts, cache size, cpu clock, ram clock/cas latency comparison  between Intel and AMD laptops.
1 month ago : why i still love intel
I don&#39;t get why you keep harking for bigger trackpads &amp; screen aspect ratio not being 16:9. Both of these things are just absolutely horrendous
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m27s">0:27</a> That shot is awesome! inb4 beeing stolen by other YouTubers...
Linus is the biggest AMD fan boy there ever was.  You can&#39;t even take his videos seriously becasue he is SO biased towards AMD.  I wonder what Intel did to him to make him want to hate on Intel as bad as he does.  Pretty sad really.

love the beard!
That plastic ball spinny shot was super nice. Good job B-roll team!
Rip my credit card but sure I&#39;ve buyed the ryzen 7 version
The new HP logo upside-down looks like a fist flipping you off.
got dammit Linus where is my 4k 60fps videos...1080p 60fps at least...pls ?!?!?
Обзор не объективный, у автора нет игрового кресла
how about the speakers and gaming performance.
Linus I need u. I am building my first computer and don’t have money to replace a part if it needs to. I don’t want to tell my parents. I think I bent a pin maybe on a cpu. I put it in and then put the cooler on top and it wouldn’t screw in. So I picked it up and it got stuck to the cooler. I am really scared and nervous and Linus if u could respond to this and help I will give anything. I need help with building advice to because I am in trouble. I am not looking for attention just help. Thank u.



Oh the probe lens B-rolls look sick!
LTT got a macro/probe lens.

also - out of stock, bad manufacturing, flaws. Sadly, no. of amd laptops is still only a handful right now, and there isn&#39;t much of a range to choose from
The Glare....
get rid of the touchpad altogether. nipple joystick masterrace
Should you even consider an Intel Laptop?
So what new filming toy did you get?
Anybody recommend a good laptop for programming or does it make a difference. Thanks :)


AMD: taking over desktop<br>AMD: taking over mobile<br>Sooner or later AMD is gonna compete with itself



Is your dad the guy from frozen???
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m39s">0:39</a> i just never see it coming
Maybe in the US, but across the Atlantic the 4000 range of AMD CPU&#39;s starts at over £1000 for Ryzen 7&#39;s, which is like 30% more than US prices.
AMD, YES!
What is wrong with intel ? Seems theyre lagging compared competitor, even apple trying to use its own,

You said it. I got it.
Here&#39;s the thing about typing on it and having your thumb hitting the pad, technically when you are typing your palms are supposed to be hovering above the laptop slightly, resting it on the laptop (or a desk for that matter when using a keyboard) is the lazy way to type. Just throwing that out there.  I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t do it, but still, not the laptop&#39;s fault.
I bought Asus Ryzen 3500U last year with fingerprint, microsd, type C  slots with numpad and better design than this at 42000 Rs. which is about 550 dollars.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=06m13s">06:13</a> Me too me too. My only complain is that 16 by 9 aspect ratio. I expected 16 by 10 with slim bezel 💻
<a href="https://youtu.be/zGJSFTaFJbQ">https://youtu.be/zGJSFTaFJbQ</a>
Linus Bro, Please do a video on budget to mid budget 17-inch laptops. Intel vs AMD Ryzen 2019/2020 laptop models with specs. Availability in India is a Headache with no online shopping delivery service!
Hey Linus please do a office networking video with vlans,firewall configuration,acl, isolation of lan device,wifi management etc
So at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=3m05s">3:05</a>, the fact that the processor is not only cheaper and more performant than the Intel equivalent, but also can get away with a single heat pipe/fan cooling solution while maintaining better boost clocks - that alone illustrates where Blue Man Group is behind as well as why their laptops cost so much more. That companies have to shell out more for the CPU up front and spend more on R&amp;D as well as the actual copper/fans to cool it, well, guess who gets to pay for that? (Spoiler: not Intel.)
Is this AMD&#39;s revenge for Intel making misleading mobile performance charts?
What&#39;s the real deal with the beard?<br>Dollar shave club is not sponsoring you now or effect of the mean comment video?
You actually can charge it with the USBc that is already there
The Lenovo Flex 14 really do be out here flexing, a little too much actually
Looks promising. Would consider, but I dont travel that much lately. Hmm, will it be here an Omen 15 with Ryzen review? :) Pretty please!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=5m22s">5:22</a> when you can’t be bothered actually typing for the shot
this was one of my favourite segues ever!
Watching this on my 2018 HP Envy x360 makes me mad. Sweet performance but 2 and a half hours of battery life. Should&#39;ve waited.
Probably won&#39;t go for AMD laptops without USB-C charging
I was looking for a cheap laptop to buy and when he said 799$ is low price range....1st world countries poor population is like rich people for 3rd world countries .
I was watching some of linuses older videos and a have to say that he looks weird without a beard.
Your getting payed to say that hp is better. of all Asus dose a better job
Cool
As usual manufacturer shove AMD only on their mid-range and low-end lineup because that&#39;s where they belongs. Nevertheless, no matter how good it is, it lack 1 thing called THUNDERBOLT 3.<br>Oh wait there&#39;s USB-C and DP MST, but it lacks the beauty of daisy-chaining with 1 cable and also delivering enough power to not just charge the laptop but also power an eGPU.
I am disappointed that the new Dell XPS, Macbook pro, and Razer Blade all did not launch with Ryzen inside.
LINUS I HAVE A LAPTOP AND MY LAPTOP CANT EVEN RUN MINECRAFT!<br>:( I&#39;m very sad
“Excellent colours”......shows Linus’ pastey white ass 😂
Just got a Lenovo with a 4500u. It’s fuckin sick
LTT have new host? Nio, it&#39;s just Linus grewing beard!
You guys should take a look at the IdeaPad 5 from lenovo.
Ryzen are killing Intel so hard, I managed to get i5/16gb/512gb/MX350/14&quot;/300nits/100%sRGB for less than £600 xDDD (Edit: 1.4kg too!)
crap. crap. crap. And not cheap. Fix the stupidly sized arrow keys.
Jesus, you review a small laptop and then proceed to complain about it being small. I just don&#39;t get that.
not having usb c charging is a BIIG thing imo...
Perfect size keyboard for Donald Trump. 😅
AMD&#39;s Ryzen CPUs is a godsend for laptop users. They have better efficiency and performance with crazy cheaper price than intel&#39;s. I think in another year unless intel can compete with this even intel fans will switch to amd.
old title is okay
I thought the video was gonna be about AMD😂
I need a new laptop with a pen and an AMD processor and in Italy the only product on Amazon is Lenovo Yoga 530 and it is sometimes online and other offline. Like WHY there aren&#39;t AMD Notebook with touch screen in Italy. C mon. Intel is a waste of money today... No GPU performance and also battery is better on AMD...
*banana for reference
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m30s">4:30</a> kitty has entered the chat bois..
Lenovo please give me an X1 Extreme with this chip in it...  As much as I want an AMD laptop I can&#39;t abandon the excellent thinkpad keyboards anymore
Spectre 360 and Meltdown 420
&quot;I have no real complaints...&quot;  After saying: &quot;Trackpad sucks&quot; and &quot;Screen is too small&quot; and &quot;Not as stiff as Carbon Fiber or aluminum&quot;<br>Don&#39;t you think that it&#39;s time for AMD to be in a machine that CHECKS ALL THE BOXES?  ALL OF THEM?  NOT JUST SOME OF THEM?<br>Compromising on anything to hit price point is still compromising...
Lenovo flex 5 is a better deal in my opinion! 16 gb of ram, same cpu, dual pipe cooling on the cpu, comes with a stylus, and $200 cheaper is you get it on amazon. The down side is the display doesn’t get as bright. You guys should definitely check it out!
i hope envy x360 will be soon available in asia..
Maybe Dell will also release envy 15&quot; model with AMD APU. It will be perfect.
nice!!! 1600$ is cheaper.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Me:Remembers that i&#39;m broke.
wait till Intel has 10nm....oh wait...
While I know that laptops have low margins and are often made for office tasks primarily, having less than 16gb RAM in a new computer just doesn&#39;t make sense in this day and age.  While I could understand an 8gb configuration at the bottom of the product stack, we are talking $800+ devices here.
That probe lens B-Roll 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵 also big ups to HP for not totally sucking for once!!! Like, wasn&#39;t everyone roasting the spectre like 2 years ago?!

Boycott Intel
sad linus
Day 13 of asking for a PC thanks😁👍
HP&#39;s new logo is terrible
Whats more epic is I got a lisa su ad for amd before this video started lol
Intel has destroyed the flagship laptop market with Project Athena and it&#39;s pretty hilarious.
Would anyone actually buy an HP laptop for their own use with their own money? No thanks
This is the same laptop I picked out for my grandma to get, and she absolutely loves it!!
The Lenovo Ideapad 5 15 with the 4500U is a much better option regarding thermals, dosen&#39;t cross the 75 degrees Celsius.
You can not be doing something &quot;constantly&quot;, please get your terminology straight!<br>It is either repeatedly or continuously in the context you used constantly.
I&#39;m gonna buy it
A good choice for a school laptop.
Linus love for you to use your contacts and to get this one from china for a review Aka SCHENKER VIA 15 Pro Review, Ryzen 7 4800H R15.6&quot; laptop, Tongfang Ryzen 7 4800H 54W TDP laptop.  the CPU performance is just unbelievable
Not often that I think &quot;Do I need a Laptop...Cause I really like this one&quot; but this Laptop definitly makes me think that
I only click to see the hairstyle.
Why changed the title of the video :)
I know 0 people that want a 16 by 10 screen
Why do Linus support AMD so much
You forgot to make a video Asus tuf A15. I have it and it&#39;s marvelous. From the look, to the hardware and cinema quality sound
BTW Swift 3 comes with ryzen too.
linos tech tips is real
Fingerprint is way safer than face recog
massdrop, renames to drop because it works better for the viewers of linus... we can all drop on that..
16:9 ultrabook sucks. Go 3:2
this is my whole weekend
AMD is going to kill it once USB4 becomes commonplace, I wonder if Intel has plans to catch up, especially as Apple now joins the fold.
macbook killer?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=8m18s">8:18</a> I swear Linus is a brand ambassador for Windows Hello haha. Some users definitely need that convenience and security but I just disable login anyways for faster boot to desktop

I want an Macbook with an Ryzen <b>-</b>
Guysss plz help me.... i have a problem with my laptop...<br><br>My laptop&#39;s harddrive sata cable broke and the original one i çant find on internet.... they are selling external usb connector.... i connected my harddrive of laptop to usb but it doesnt work just show windows logo and error ..then screen just turned off.... my friend said to install windows again .....plz plz help

I have my AMD underperforming and its enough
Got my new HP with 4500U and Im able to play Kingdom come Deliverance with 25 FPS average :)
Where were these AMD APUs when I was shopping last November because my dumb Lenovo literally started falling apart. I had to choose between a Ryzen 3 dual core and an i3-1005g1, but HP offered a free NVME update on the Intel version.
I need a $300-$400 laptop that&#39;s AMD, maybe like athlon since I can&#39;t afford those higher prices.
OMG intel fanboy are crying
Hey Linus do a &quot;Which Ryzen 4000 series laptop should you buy?&quot; Please
Can we all just agree that HP laptop looks like its giving the finger.
can you please review Asus TUF A15?
Looks like they got a new macro lens
Why at 2020.. sooo hard to find slim laptop with upgradable memory??
That trackpad is huuuuge compared to what I&#39;m used to at work.
Sooooooooooooooooo this isn&#39;t even its final form !

Is this the real Linus or deepfaked Linus?
Faster? Thats true for a part, as always with amd cpu&#39;s. Thats like saying a 2700x is faster than a 9900k.
im noticing the higher quality at b rolls and cmaera angles in last few videos. whoever is your cameraman deserves some respect
For the next video, please do an ultimate showdown of Gaming Chairs. Vertagear vs Secretlab vs other gaming brands please, because there is no such content on the internet related to this topic.
Why do they change the titles of their videos?
i got intel version of this hp envy 13 and updated to windows 2004 version where the speakers are not working anymore, says there are no drivers for the speakers!!
Bro, can you talk about the Xfx RX 5700 xt THICC II
Anyone know the headphones Linus uses for WAN show? I wanna buy them
who uses a trackpad with your thumb
So... It cools better then the new MacBook air? But it doesn&#39;t have wireless cooling like the MacBook though.
who or what&#39;s herbert placard?
Unfortunately here, AMD laptops with whack-ass thermals and specs are cheaper while the good ones cost as much as the flagships :/<br><br>Meanwhile, Intel is vibin too much and I don&#39;t like it.
you guys should check out the new Lenovo YOGA 14s(R7 4800U/16GB/512GB), it only cost 714 dollar，and it have a 8 core 16t cpu
at this point we are just bashing intel
I have Ryzen 7 4700u model. What a great machine this is. From now on I won&#39;t be buying any Intel powered laptop as they are total rip-off.
Compare Linus&#39;s <b>Lenovo Legion 7i</b> review on ShortCircuit vs Hardware Canucks.<br><br>Same lameness (though full-marks on honesty) here on the very Linus Tech Tips channel with Laptops and anything that doesn&#39;t centre around homemade crazy cooling solutions. You&#39;re grownup now and with employees as Anthony - be serious, we already have iJustine to MKBHD to just spit their &quot;thots&quot;<br><br>The <b>Lenovo Legion 7i</b> is a serious balanced example to introspect upon - this is more of a feedback because I haven&#39;t subscribed to any of your channel and yet do enjoy (most of the time) watching most if not all of them (hour-long videos excluded) - Likewise, <b>Optimum Tech</b> where the videos can still be anywhere between 10-20mins long yet not &quot;Let&#39;s skip and get over it quicker like a chore&quot; …Hire more people then and just make appearances.
lol just bought it after this video, thanks for the video!
Whats that pad they used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m16s">4:16</a> for the laptop?

Hope Hp put AMD on Spectre x360
Can you do a vid on the Dell G5 and G7 2020?
For The Horde .. I meen Intek !
Looking forward to this coming up on the used market in a couple of years
An amd ad come up
Been an intel fan since 2008. I think I&#39;m ready AMD... I think I&#39;m ready.
do a review on redragon monitors
do a review on redragon monitors
Thats the same chassis the new 4500u flex 14 lenovo has. :pepethink:
I LOVED THE NEW OPENING!!
Well i got a HP ENVY x360 cp-0005ng... and i must say: it&#39;s total crap. And I can&#39;t really think that any Convertible from HP is better, because they kinda messed up every aspect a Convertible should have. Lets start with battery life. 4 hours max. Then we have the heat problems. The Ryzen 7 regulary hits 80°C (when using office and just one office program). Therefore a silent usage is something you can totally forget. The fans are always on and are quite noisy. And as soon as you hit those 80°C, the Laptop start to lag pretty hard. As well in gaming (like LoL with a low resolution) as in the normal use of just the OS. Nothing works fluent anymore. Cool thing is (not), that if you turn the Convertible in Tablet mode. It just heats itself up way faster, so you can&#39;t use it anymore way earlier. And in general, writing the Stylus is not a great experience, and for other things when it doesn&#39;t lie on your desk, it is just too heavy. Did I forget something? Probably a lot of other bad things. So my recommendation: dont buy any Convertibles from Hp. They are crap.
Banana for scale for the touchpad-I see there&#39;s a 9gag veteran on LTT
AMD.........thanks?????
Spinfoil Hat Theory: AMD wanted this to be in the Envy to outsell the Spectre’s to then later gain control of the higher tier market.

I am seriously considering getting one of these to replace my current gaming laptop lol.
Linus got built and grew a beard, he looks like that CHAD meme
How about heat and power consumption? Thats a major consideration for me
Basically if u are poor u can’t game even if u are good in gaming
Still waiting for Linus to literally drop something while introducing <a href="http://drop.com/">Drop.com</a>. I thought that HP Envy might bite the dust for a second.
im using a ryzen 4700u on my notebook. Min 7 max 10 hour  batterylife is a cool thing.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m03s">6:03</a> Kid,close your eyes for a moment.Linus just intentionally flashed🔞!
These AMD Chips are so exciting, especially for people like me. I got a Inspiron 7000 series laptop towards the end of my senior year of High School (I’m a rising college senior now, rip to my senior year). That device was around the same price as this Envy. But is rocking a dual core that chugged even when I bought it. Having 4 more, much faster cores in a device with smaller bezels and longer battery is super exciting. Not in the market for a laptop now since I built a desktop earlier this year (with a Ryzen 5 3600X) but exciting nonetheless. Hopefully Intels big.LITTLE mobile chips bring them up to AMDs budget mobile chips’ value, speed, and battery life.
I&#39;ve been buying AMD since the Athalon 800.  ALWAYS has been better than intel.
Wait till arm MacBook comes
Title change again?
Top 5 worst segway ever...
I own the Envy X360 with the Ryzen 4700U 8-core CPU. Had it for 6 weeks now. <br>It&#39;s the absolute best laptop I&#39;ve ever used.<br>Linus&#39; point about the aspect ratio is very valid though. You NEED to set the task bar to auto-hide, or put your apps in true full screen mode using F11. Otherwise the screen is just a bit too small for my liking.<br>I&#39;m comparing it to my trusty Macbook Pro 13&quot; early 2015. That one has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> aspect ratio. This small difference has a BIG impact on perceived comfort.<br>But performance wise this thing shreds any task you throw at it. And even light gaming is a pleasure. Something like Civ 6, AoE 2 DE, or even Total War Warhammer 2 are playable (ob low settings of course, but you get consistent 60 fps across the board).<br>I&#39;m pretty sure the lower spec&#39;d model with the Ryzen 4500U has better battery life, since my unit never makes it beyond 8 hours, but it&#39;s not a deal breaker. All the other features like multi touch, eccellent sound, and adequate build quality with a premium feel, more than make up for it.<br>I&#39;m very happy with my purchase. :)

Linus aka AMD sales person...
Anyone want to buy me a laptop??
Could have made at least one gaming test for the sake of comparison between AMD and Intel integrated graphics on those machines.
I still not received giveaway for you. 2 years now
Saving money
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m18s">4:18</a> Amazing sound byte lol
I am now turned on by AMD
how can we get more companies to switch to a 3:2 as a standard rather than an option... makes no sense to see a business oriented laptop lineup like x1 carbon for example, having 16:9 on board when you&#39;d think more vertical real estate be so much nicer and provide better productivity...
i&#39;ll give it to him, that was the SMOOTHEST segway ever
The early know this title got renamed.
I have a question about the CPU, Core i7-9700F, and the Core i7-9700 I don&#39;t know which one is best for gaming dose anyone know?
At least the Lenovo Flex 14 is accurately named.
45%?? You mean 25
I have 1 question: does radiator placement matter?<br>And should I put it as an intake or exhaust?

This was actually a good Segway, worthy of a watch instead of a skip to after it ends.
love the new intro
About a month and a half ago I got my fiancé a HP laptop from Best Buy for college and this was a STEAL. $530 and it has an Ryzen 5 (6 core 12 thread) 12GB RAM, Vega 8 gpu, and a 256GB SSD
amd laptop proessor  s trash r3 a6 a4 a9  (a9 12gb ram 549.99) crash, slow. r3 to many refund , crash everytime
before watching this i was anti-AMD, but after watching this i am starting to consider AMD for my next notebook.

50% here for the tech news, 50% here for the segues XD
Why would you want a 3:2 laptop?

Anyone else get the Pulseway ad with Linus in it before this started? It&#39;s remarkably well made and surprisingly non annoying. Also I finally get the concept of Pulseway now; They took a cheesy 90&#39;s comedy premise and made it an actual functioning product. Wow.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=8m59s">8:59</a> &quot;Ladies you know the procedures&quot;
I assume HP will release a Spectre model with this chipset.  Do you think even Microsoft could use Ryzen in its Surface Book line?  would be amazing
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m03s">6:03</a> hahahaha!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m34s">0:34</a> that is a very sleek logo design from hp not bad
Harder better faster stronger
AMD is king in 2020-21 🌟
That macro lense does look very weird.
i5 on a $1000 laptop... lol
I was <b>just</b> contemplating on buying either this one or a Lenovo C740. Perfect timing!<br>I do wonder whether the C740 is of a bit better build quality, though...
Still just seeing the remnants that have been collecting dust in warehouses for the last 2 or 3 years. Nothing impressive. Wait another 4 years. Then things will begin to pick up
Tthe one downside I can see is that there is no HDMI port.
Hey hey hey...what about HP Omen 2020
Which laptop is great for illustration
okay, I&#39;ve been watching you for like 6 years...can you please come up with another word than segway, to come up with an actual segway
The glossy displays`re a no go for me either with Intel or AMD. Interestingly, nobody of the LTT&#39;s staff has issues with this.


Ouch, the cigar is being put towards Intel belly.
AMD for the win! I have a full AMD pc, rx 5700xt ryzen 7. It works great
Me with 2 16:9 monitors 👁👄👁
At last the AMD model has a fingerprint sensor. It was incredibly annoying that the previous one didn&#39;t as it essentially forced me to buy Intel.
SD 865+ : 2.3GHz??LOL....noobs
I got AMD Ad
I&#39;m just about sure that Intel will either go bankrupt or go away from the CPU market. Competition is needed, so AMD might become the next Intel, before or after Intel goes away from the CPU market.<br>Oh, and I&#39;m writing this from an Intel laptop.
The b-roll is becoming a-roll
Truly appreciate y&#39;all limiting the sponsor messages to 10-second multiples.
I don&#39;t agree 16x9 is the is gr8 specially vs a 4x3 horrible even wider I&#39;d prefer, what I try to say is the ratio is good speacilly for media consumption. On a personal note I would not buy a computer without a numpad...
AMD laptops: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger.
How long you test product ?..just running benchmarks once and start praise/condemn products ...not fair comparison IMO

make a video about laptop upgrade <br>like Asus GL552VW<br>like more display Mz, more ram and replacing DVD drive with a CADDY, thermal paste on the Processor
How is this laptop performing for casual esport games? And I can&#39;t really find this laptop with the new amd, does anyone have the link?
It&#39;s amusing that the tables have turned in favor of AMD. Most PC enthusiasts are now embracing AMD.
Amd: faster, stronger cheaper<br>Intel fanboys: we had a good run, imma head out

you know what i hate the most about that laptop? it&#39;s not available anywhere here in germany. estimated delivery 4months+.<br>i just set some filters on our meta-shop search with ~13&quot; ryzen 5 4xxx and fullhd+ ... well, x360 seem to be the only ones in that sweet spot.<br><br>is it too hard to make a good portable (~1kg, ~13&quot;) with medium specs and not potatoe screen? not too slow but good battery life.
Guys i am dumb! I am a starter video editor should i get this or not?please tell with pros and cons...please i beg
Ironic we&#39;re going back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>!
The one with the dedicated GPU version only has Intel :[
WTF? Why the nowadays laptops are flexible?<br>I think need a Caterpillar version of this but with a numeric pad.
Intel now is like an old car where you keep pushing the turbo boost just to keep up with everyone 😜




Hope all
I absolutely love the decision to keep 16:9 aspect ratio. I hate that every laptop is going for more square look while every phone is going for ultra wide. <br>16:9 is a standard in content. Let&#39;s keep it that way



I own the previous version with the 3500u in it and was super excited to get an upgrade for this year. However I mainly use this laptop to take notes during classes in tablet mode and for that task they actually made it worse by moving the power button to the keyboard, killing power switching functionality in tablet mode. They did the same to the volume rocker in the generation before
The Envy x360 is way to loud, the keyboard layout is confusing and the trackpad is &quot;sticky&quot;. I sent it back 2 days after getting it.
Yo not kidding.<br>I had friends in my school and some from another school.<br>We got AMD laptops and they got Intel laptops.<br>All us went to college together. 2nd year all Intel laptops stopped working and I am still doing some Excel work on my AMD.


Never get AMD for gaming , after a disastrous Ryzen experience I got myself an Intel 9750hf with rtx 2060 legion laptop and I cannot say how much better is Intel with Nvidia , never wasting my money on AMD again
THISS IS MY WHOLE WEEKEND!
Not sure why anyone would be buying an intel gaming laptop right now, watch the big players swoop in early next year with some amazing new configurations... Still praying for a Ryzen with a 120hz refresh oled panel
Smells too much like an ad to me. You&#39;re not comparing it to the Dell because HP asked you not to. Poor video from you guys, very obvious advertising, zero interesting content.
Smaller batteries(9wh less), better battery life !!!!
I love how he says intels &quot;newish&quot; CPU
Amd 7nm is far superior the intel 10nm
segway meme is dead meme, stop it now k pls thx
Now matter how many times you will shove it to my face, I will never buy your merch. It&#39;s just plain annoying and it makes me hate it even more.
AMD destroying Intel in every single branch is not even funny any more.
When people have something better and cheaper offered, what&#39;re they usually do ?<br><br><br><br><br>&quot;No thanks. Stick to Intel, i can&#39;t go wrong&quot;
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m03s">6:03</a> Demonetized????
Can u possibly do a review on the Lenovo idea pad 5 14/15. For the 15 I don&#39;t see many reviews especially of the 4800u model
I love that dy laptop
You wonder what kind of loss AMD are making on these chips now. Nobody&#39;s buying them, so they&#39;re giving them away to manufacturers for next to nothing..
: Show the balls clip part again!! Forget about the laptops. The balls, the balls!
Made Swedish subtitles and submitted them. Surprisingly good translation tools in YouTube nowadays.
Man that is some beautiful b-roll. Very impressive.
Oof banana nice knowing you.
That&#39;s weird. My AMD x360 does have Windows Hello 🤔. And it&#39;s an older model as well
Non-paid ad/recommendation/what-not: I&#39;m looking CLOSELY at that Lenovo Yoga Slim 7. Unlike the HP lineup, it doesn&#39;t have those right-side extra buttons (plus for me, minus for some) and has a properly centered touchpad. It also doesn&#39;t have the power button above the backspace. I&#39;m eagerly waiting for reviews, since it looks pretty much exactly like what I&#39;ve been waiting for.<br>However, it clocks in at a higher price-point than the Envy, so if you&#39;re more sensitive to price than nitpicky, consider touch-screen a must-have, or prefer 13.3 to 14 inches, the Envy might be the better choice. The Slim 7 sports more (4266MHz???) RAM, larger storage and a higher-tier CPU, though.
AMD is killin&#39; it lately.  What&#39;s a shame is that they&#39;re keeping the x86 architecture alive in doing so.  I was ready to suffer an underpowered ARM for a desktop.  A beefy ARM would be cool if it existed but there are 2 problems with that.  1) ARM still owns their architecture so no proper competitors can arise and any published binaries tie the public to an owned architecture. 2) The architecture isn&#39;t built to scale.  Out-of-order is awkward and instruction extensions not only violate their terms but need to be hacked into their instruction set.  For this reason, RISC-V is my ideal.  I want a laptop WITH THAT.
HP = Horrible Products
If you think this is crazy you should have a look at the new Lenovo IdeaPad 5. I configured one for a friend for around the same price as the HP but with a 4800U and 16Gb of RAM. The rest is pretty similar. Those Ryzen laptops are just marvelous.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m58s">6:58</a> <br>Me: I hate how small my hands are. <br>HP: I got something that 68% of males and half of females can&#39;t enjoy as much as you will. <br>Me: Yo, lemme hit that.



Probe lens here?
Bruh I’m tired of you recommending these trash and outdated looking ass HP laptops 😂😂 nobody wants them shits. Looks so 2010
but can i have a LONGER LAPTOP
Making full use of that probe lens eh guys?
Lmao Intel gotta step up their game
What about GrAPhiCs?
rip intel and this is the 10nm chip
workin that super sayian vibe with those Dragon Balls LMG, workin in good.
Why do LTT&#39;s video titles change a thousand times? This was called &quot;Should you even consider an Intel Laptop?&quot;

I would love to know how well this little bugger runs something like Qubes OS. I have been searching everywhere for an AMD and NON-Nvidia laptop with enough cores, RAM, and storage to make qubes reasonable.
What is segue😂😂<br>Nobody does it better than Linus media 🙏
Even with good specs, I don&#39;t recommend HP anymore. Too much issues and bad service in the past. They have to regain my trust again by good reports from other people.
I hope apple goes amd
Now I know what to get As a gift
Someone is having a lot of fun with the Laowa probe lens...
I&#39;ve been looking forward to more Linus laptop vids since I&#39;m gonna be going off to college soon!
"Original title: &quot;Should you Even CONSIDER an Intel Laptop?
&quot;"

Would such new ryzen 4000s laptops work ok with Sketchup and Vray? What are your thoughts and recommendations for those two applications? thanks
Please include &quot;envy x360 vs spectre x360&quot; in the title, so I find the video, if I look for it :)
Is there a 2,5k $ AMD Modell coming out with anything like a 2070/80 super?
Given how much we&#39;re seeing people asking for AMD laptops, I&#39;m guessing manufacturers will have started designing some by now. When do you think we&#39;ll actually start to see some good options being announced?
AMD.. yey !!
Hi Linus. When can we expect a new series of graphics cards? I&#39;m eager to get a new one!!!!! I have a 5700XT but I want more!!!
The next few years might be huge for AMD. Earlier adoption of PCIe 4.0, and probably earlier adoption of 5.0 too once that rolls around, USB 4 is coming, and hopefully we&#39;ll start seeing better adoption rates of eGPUs. Assuming the next generation of GPUs are still on PCIe 3.0, a USB 4 port piggybacking PCIe 4.0 will give us the equivalent performance of 3.0 x8 on the 4.0 x4 port, and with better eGPU adoption, that&#39;s huge, assuming AMD also supplies us with enough physical lanes to actually do this, as laptops are historically starving for lanes, especially now that storage is tied to PCIe. We might actually see a thin and light give us actual gaming performance. <br><br>Now, I know this is a pipe dream, but imagine what would happen if AMD gave us the amount of physical lanes needed and two discrete USB 4 ports (2 times the lanes), if the ports piggyback the PCIe 4.0 spec, that gives us the equivalent of a full 3.0 x16 port. Considering that Intel seems to stick to their 16 lanes on mobile, if AMD could one-up them, especially with storage being tied to PCIe, AMD could easily outpace Intel at expandability and performance. <br><br>If AMD takes the right steps, and given what they&#39;ve done with Zen and early adoption of PCIe 4.0, I think they will take the right steps, they could easily assert dominance over the mobile market within a few generations. At this point, all they have to do is outpace Intel, and so far they are, the rest of it depends on industry adoption of AMD mobile, which is starting to ramp up.
Who thought to use balls
You should review the new Lenovo ryzen 5 4500u laptops! Much cheaper and more storage
LTT needs to 3d print a laptop chassis with metal internals to make their own laptop using ebay laptop parts
The tiny trackpad is just an instant no-go for me, which is true for basically every HP laptop
Again, &quot;what&#39;s a segue&quot; isn&#39;t the same as saying &quot;what&#39;s a segue TO OUR SPONSOR&quot;. You really got to get those words in, guys. Otherwise it&#39;s not clearly paid-endorsement. It needs to be unambiguous.
Can you review the asus vivobook 17 X712DA

is this gonna be your new laptop?
nice going HP
You probably should&#39;ve compared to the comet lake i5 10510U. It&#39;s cheaper and faster than the 1035g4 but it uses the 14nm++. The 10nm Intels aren&#39;t really ready yet I guess.
Did you guys get a new lense?
&lt;--- Named my daughter after anthony
A banana for scale? Intellectuals. Love it.
If this had 16gb of ram it would be worth buying imo. For me at least if it can&#39;t be upgraded 16 is the minimum acceptable ram at $600+
U guys are going to make Intels future like Nokia loss of mobile predominance
How about you underdclock the AMD and see how long it goes on the same Performance LvL as compared to the Spectre=?
Any IT-guy non enthusiast shouders at the words, fingerprint ensor and facerecognition to unlock anything XD this is so insecure you wont belive it ;D
I use the Envy X360 13 for a month and I love it. I replaced an full blown XPS 15 9570 with i7 8750h and GTX 1050 Ti with this little puppy and have no regrets!<br>I have the version with 4700U and 16GB. I&#39;m a graphicdesigner and use the Adobe suite on it. It just runs through workloads. <br>I can even play GTA 5 on Full HD on it. For 999€ it&#39;s simply excellent!<br>PS: I love the new b-rolls with die laowa probe makro!

AMD’s 7nm is no joke! Battery life is surprisingly great!
Thing is a whole lot of new AMD based laptops have at least 1-2 major issues due to EOMs bad designs - most commonly bad cooling(Asus TUF Gaming)and shitty screens(zephyrus G14) for example

linus is a lucky mofo i had an AMD ad about ryzen and i didnt want to skip
Dear, Dell please put amd in the next xps, pleaaase
Add one more adjective to the video title; &quot;Unavailable&quot;.
I&#39;ve taken the plunge with envy x360 ryzen 3700u very early this year. Will upgrade to the 4700u soon. Despite your complaints on aspects caused by even smaller chassis i actually prefer smallish 13&quot; since it is the smallest screen size i can use. Thanks Linus
To bad we don&#39;t have Thunderbolt with AMD. As an editor on the go, the 40gb/s is almost essential for me to push monitors. Looking forward to USB 4!
This guy been hating on intel its been 20 videos now . They owe him?
NOOOO I FELL FOR THE SEGWAY
Either you die a hero<br>or live long enough to be called intel
Great laptop, bad stickers. They&#39;re covering almost all of the palm rest
Thanks for the very interesting video! It seems that AMD nailed it:)
Linus beat me to it again.<br>I&#39;ve always wanted to roll my laptop on top of colorful balls.<br>Oh well.
&quot;undersized by today&#39;s standards...&quot;, telling everyone to copy the MacBook&#39;s huge trackpad? What about palm rejection or everyone just bend their wrists sharply.

Gift me a 3950x please thank you
So does this mean that the Ryzen 7 4700 (2.0 GHz) Envy is slower in comparison to the Ryzen 5 (2.3 Ghz) Envy in this video?
Now I&#39;d like to see an ultrabook with a screen that has a good response time so you can stream games to it. That&#39;s one area where a lot of laptops fall short. I&#39;m actually surprised google hasn&#39;t embraced this with their chromebooks and stadia. Seems like a huge waste of potential.
The b roll on the videos seems to just keep improving, while it’s played we don’t get to see that beautiful linus but, perhaps the b roll is good enough
I tried installing Ubuntu and it gave me,kernel panics so yeah I had to go intel this time around
There&#39;s that special micro lens performing amazing b-roll
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=3m56s">3:56</a> Lol :))))
Any good laptops for $400?
Oh Linus, you got me there with that segue. You got me good...
I would have bought the Envy 360, iver the lenovo flex 14, if the SD card was full sized, i cannot find high performance micro SD cards like my lexar 2000x, Sony Tough, or ProGrade UHS ii v90 cards
Buys white and black LTT water bottle... <br>See&#39;s it in every video since and wonders how long they&#39;ve actually been using this bottle in the ads
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=8m18s">8:18</a> is the table warped or the laptop????
We just got an envy x360 from Costco. 15in is 599
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m05s">6:05</a> my eye
Hey, I was wondering if you could help me get a gaming PC. I don&#39;t have a lot of money at the moment. I only have $300.  Please like this so he can see!!!!!
All my laptops and desktops are using Intel CPUs, and I will keep buy Intel CPU:)
I will not buy any AMD product for some time, at least until they outsourced drivers writing for people who known how to write it as they did with manufacturing. 3 mount ago bough x570 with 2700x to get in the end the best ddr4 platform on paper with 4000 series desktop CPU upgrade,  but in the month time it sopped working after  MS patch, my intel platforms work as clocks no issues even after this update... Regular USB headset crashes as well as Logitech webcam ... On Intel platforms, nothing and everything working and event viewer are boring to inspect. AMD right now produce sub-standard quality product overall, if they fixed drivers and firmware (most crashes solving beta version for my board arrive after month and lucky it is mainly entertainment rig so I can afford to let the thing in such manner) it might be a decent product, but I personally will not buy this anymore, Intel rocks at least in run always. Last thing AMD CPU  voltages by auto are way too high ... and even if lower them a number of crashers increase (no OC just Precision boost and XMP) ... So longevity of CPU is questionable, it will help that system is water-cooled but I have doubts.
please manufacturers!<br>make AMD CPU laptop with thunderbolt,<br>I want to switch but my eGPU set up is holding me back
Those macro shots in the b-roll are amazing! Brandon is really earning his pay.
You’re weeks behind on this one but that’s ok. <br><br>You also missed that they put the backspace key right next to the power button. That’s going to bite people.

How do I know this is the actual Linus speaking in this video
All I keep thinking is, this is paving the way for a Switch Pro/successor so we can still have the Switch form factor but have better specs in a few years to come.
out of the 10 laptops I have purchased over the years only 2 of them were Intel based. My very first laptop many many years ago cause it was a screaming deal and the last one I bought my wife. I hated her laptop with a vengeance mostly due to the fact there was no way to effectively disable the  hd graphics even though it had a Nvidia discrete system. It never would default to the discrete system even when told to thus forcing you to tell windows to use the Nvidia chip every single time you wanted to play a game. Never had that issue with AMD laptops. Now that you showed off this bad boy I may consider snagging a couple around the holidays :). Intel better wake up.
well - sounds great and all. too bad the display is a mirror.
Linus’s strike in the pulseway ad has me bugging man
Just checked the prices, For some reason HP thinks they can get away with a 100% mark-up to buyers in Australia.
Wish you would have compared this AMD  loaded HP Envy to the HP Spectre w/Intel’s i7-1065G7 w/Iris Plus graphics. THAT would have been more interesting and compelling given the extra price delta
sounds like a good laptop for steam link with all that battery life
This might not be fair as the envy x360 is a ultrabook instead of a gaming laptop but the dell g5 se has it beat as it is $80 more but it has a RX5600M (2060 max-q equivalent). Base model is $880 added with a Ryzen 5 4600H 6-core 12-thread cpu.
Didn&#39;t see that segue coming
Can anybody send me a Link to the amd Laptop
Those tiny up and down keys are a no go for me despite whatever the specs might be
These laptop sound like they would be perfect as work laptops. Except they are not. They intentionally miss important business features like dTPM. I think Intel still has a lot of contractual leverage over the OEMs.
Hey ltt I am getting into pc gaming and I dont know what parts to buy to build my literal fist gaming pc right now I am stuck using my 1050ti rog strix and i dont understand how to find parts that work with each other but I dont want to buy a full pre built pc because i want to build it to learn more about it while i build it (also Im into the idea into a sleeper pc and already have a case for it)
Can we start shaming laptop manufacturers for putting so many stupid stickers on the laptop?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=5m13s">5:13</a> thats why it is the &quot;flex&quot; 14



Guys theres a cheaper one for $670. Although you get a 3.7 ghz ryzen 5 2500u 4-core 8-threads. Still plenty powerful.
Only 1 USB-C,  a lot of keyboard-flex and worthless trackpad.. <br>CPU doesn’t really matter ..
please compare i3 and ryzen 3 in laptop
And yet my friend rather buy an intel cpu
if you are happy, mature and when you buy whatever you like,  you don&#39;t care  about the opinion of a clown like this man.
Intel cpus get so hot on the spectres that the adhesive keeping the rubber feet just melts away.
@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m28s">7:28</a>, he&#39;s on <a href="http://hackertyper.net/">hackertyper.net</a>
2019 was such a bad year for buying laptops, especially intel...












Awesome! I am looking for a new laptop for under a grand ♡♡♡
AMDDDDDDDDDDDDD
AMD makes terrible processors, I&#39;ll buy Intel every time.
heyy LTT<br>I&#39;ve got a problem I want to build my pc because I don´t have one atm sadly but I&#39;ve never had a gaming pc and I am looking to buy/build one but i am not sure because of the pandemic and increase in price + new ryzen things will come out.
Intel should back off, I Hate seeing intel processors now.<br>Edit- They are lazy now
Hahahahahahahahahaha...
Finally some Laowa macro shots on the latest videos. Well done and not abused.
Glad you kicked out the corona from your system Linus, you look less like a Canadian hobo this week
the envy would of dine it already if it was available in australia and and upgradable ram even if it made it thicker
Linus saying 16:9 is outdated<br>Me with an old <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> display<br>🙂

remember the days when team red was the hotter CPU?<br>Pepperidge Farms remembers.
Good video.
I came here to see Linus but instead found a deep fake of Solomon Lane reviewing laptops!
As soon as I bought a Asus ROG strix G531GT that has an intel cpu, AMD took over and I regret my decision

That 16:9 aspect ratio really is a bummer with all the caveats it brings with it. And I would rather have a plain touch screen or no touch screen than a foldable 2 in 1 but that performance is really cool. Hopefully processors of this level of efficiency and performance are more widely in use when my next upgrade cycle comes along.
Who would have thought HP doesn&#39;t make the best laptops.
What&#39;s exactly the different between Gaming headset vs &quot;normal&quot; headset ?? I heard there even the so call studio headset for music recording purposes .. is it all just some marketing bullshit ?? I mean can any one tell which headset is that by testing it without knowing the type ??
bestbuy has that hp on sale for 580$ right now
holy shi- he has a beard now? how long have I been gone
Lol thats gonna be hella expensive here at the Philippines i cant even afford a bnew laptop im buying a second hand 400$ laptop with ryzen 3 2200u which is good for me ? It sucks here
Intel inside<br>Wallet outside<br>Performance outside
Who uses a trackpad in 2020
This hp envy is 1083$ in Hungary while the Spectre is close to 1500
wait wait whattt? I havent watched Linus in awhile and he has facial hair !?????? FACIAL HAIR !????????????? FACCCIAL HAIR
I got a pulseway ad with Linus in it before this video... wtf
Just waiting for a Dell XPS Ryzen
linus has babi hands
Can you review the Sony reon? Looks like an interesting product but not sure about how good it is. Thanks!
HTF can you recommend 8GB of ram in 2020?  8GB was mandatory over a decade ago, my outdated telephone has 8GB of ram ffs
Title changed ... real Title : is Intel laptop even worth buying ???
i swear new laptops look like worse build quality for twice the price.
Herbert Placard
I&#39;ve been using the HP Envy x360 since Ryzen mobile 2000 and I can tell you it&#39;s great, but that 4000 looks much much better

Man those macro lens shots are crazy
They still insist on having that crappy and difficult to remove Bang and Olufsen audio setup. What value does it add!?!?
when legends fights back.
I hate my current laptop right now thank you
I’m begging to use an actual Segway to Segway into sponsorships. Please. I need this
had an amd laptop. was close and fell apart mighty quickly. intel all the way for me

The hoi polloi still think of AMD being a cheap alternative to Intel.. The zeitgeist has changed my friends! AMD to the moon!
did brandon buy a macro lens recently?
I just picked up the 4700u/16g/512g/Win10Pro Envy x360 13 from microcenter for 1000USD a few weeks ago.  More screen brightness would be nice, and I&#39;m running into some USB PD issues, otherwise, I&#39;m very happy with it. Yes, it needs a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> screen, but none of that is a deal breaker for me.
If only one percent more of males found it to be a no go
Might not see any HP Spectre due to the weird thing no one is talking about: No ThunderBolt on AMD laptops anywhere and so few even on desktops.<br>Linus please do a &quot;Why no Thunderbolt on AMD&quot; video.  Mostly due to Intel IP BS I&#39;d think...
of course a few months after i needed to buy a laptop for school AMD comes back with these godly processors
I love the new b-roll scenes with the macro probe lens.
Wtf my dad doesn&#39;t believe your tips Linus
Watching this on my day old HP envy x360 lol Though i opted for the 15 inch Ryzen 7 version. Very pleased so far especially with it being $200 off at Best Buy. No complaints here
that was a good segway. really got me
I personally am glad AMD is producing quality products. :-/
When you just bought a Dell XPS 13....
The people who really need a laptop don&#39;t get it and people like Linus buy a billion of them...<br>For example me....<br>My configuration <br>Intel core 2 duo <br>2 gb ram<br>No graphics card

is this a deepfake?
You can tell when there is a sponsor because his mood quickly changes
Day 2 of asking for a pc
Intel got greedy. Amd isbthe way forward as long as they make good deals.
Nice probe lens you have there
I own 2019 model of Envy x360, love that, but 2GB of memory will be occupied with Radeon, so it&#39;s actually 6GB... and it doesn&#39;t last 13 hours lol. Like 7 hours at most?  And become sooo hot. I dunno, maybe it has been changed.
Cut extra money for overacting that muscle man
Now, I&#39;d really want to buy a ryzen laptop! But not many options are available in my country right now! 😑
Not gonna lie... that sponsor came out of nowhere
Would be nice if any of these are ever in stock!! I&#39;ve been searching for 4900hs laptops on amazon, newegg, etc. for months and there is never anything available! WTF is this vaporware?!
I still can&#39;t figure out if this is the real Linus.
We need Nvidia GPUs with these new mobile Ryzen 4000 chips...and we need them now
I wanna see how these POS&#39;s game, cmon linus
I love AMD but sadly Arma 3 doesn&#39;t, so I&#39;m basically forced to intel if I even want to top 40 fps in koth.

Hi Linus
Linus: &quot;hey everyone HP makes good and fast computers!&quot;<br>Me who just got an hp omen: &quot;I know&quot;
DAMN THOSE CLOSE-UP SHOTS ARE APPLE TV COMMERCIAL LEVEL!
Just not going to mention the truly awful 58.7% sRGB and 37.4% AdobeRGB? 😡

Too bad most Ryzen 4000 laptops available rn are deliberately nerfed by the manufacturers with their shitty cooling and/or displays
Pretty pointless comparison. 6 core outperforms a 4 core woop di doo
Sony Xperia 1 II review plz
Why is the 15 in version considerably cheaper than the 13in?
Wish HP made a non 2-in-1 version.
Waiting for dell G5 15 se review ☺️

My reflex at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m41s">0:41</a> tap 4 times
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m29s">6:29</a><br>Why you.....why you bully me 😢🤣

lenovo flex do be flexing tho....
Hey Linus, i think its time to do a &quot;Ryzen processors explained&quot; video again
Linus&#39;s butt in those boxer briefs - baby&#39;s got back.<br><br>OMG BECKY.
Is the ssd upgradable on this one?
It is too bad that back in april when I bought my laptop for school, there weren’t any amd laptops that met all the things I wanted (like rigidity and gpu).
You guys should review the Hyper Mirror. Kickstarter 5G millimeterWave wireless display over usb-c. The thing has almost no lag
Have too say something before the video... i hate Intel laptos... the mid low end is trash 🗑 really trash thanks god for amd pushing this market intel always was a monopoly
Is that a new lens they are using for the keyboard B-roll?
do a $1300 ryzen build plzzzz
Hey LTT i want to set your wallpaper on my desktop. Please send me its download link.
I wouldn&#39;t spend a dollar on HP, the build quality is garbage and their aesthetics just don&#39;t strike a chord with me.
That&#39;s why Intel is losing now. They got lazy of being always
You guys get a probe lens? Great addition for product shots.
I paid $550 for this in a 15&quot; version on sale at Best Buy. The only trade off is that it&#39;s a little heavier and it only has 250 nits of brightness The 15&quot; has upgradeable storage and RAM. 3200 speed on the RAM too. Great device for the price
ting at lightning rod on a DeLorean: &quot;1.21 gigawatt
hey linus please do a review of pen input on LINUX on 2-in-1 devices, there&#39;s like 5 people who want that video but they (we) exist.
Linus pointing at laptop: &quot;3.3 Ghz!&quot;<br><br>Doc Brown pointing at lightning rod on a DeLorean: &quot;1.21 gigawatts!&quot;

this dude became a meme
This man has more merch plugs than English colonies
when my laptop isn&#39;t even 16:9 :(
Those probe lens shots are great.
AMD computers sucks because they don&#39;t work well with many software. Intel is the key for a stable computer. AMD are just garbage
Seriously, those specs! I game on my i3 (old gen), 4GB RAM, and no dedicated GPU. Can you giveaway the builds and laptops? Do you really need them...?


14h of battery life<br>&quot;This is my whole weekend!&quot;
No kidding I just went to best buy and bought it for 579.99 Ryzen 5 4500u 8gb ram, 256gb SSD. What a steal
Just wait for Rocket Lake, that&#39;s all its good for.  Rocket Lake if you just can&#39;t stand AMOLED.
As I keep saying like a broken record.  AMD Ryzen gaming laptops would be nice, like real top performers ones.  That being said I do like my Aspire 5 Ryzen as just a normal office laptop.
The only part of this my amd laptop has is the cheap part
I guarantee you that everyone at LTT is getting rich from buying AMD stock right after they make these videos.
I almost saw this video 10 hours ago when it had the other title &quot;Is it even worth getting an intel laptop&quot;. Now in the morning, it&#39;s a different way of saying the same thing - I guess. 😆😆<br><br>Love from India Team LTT! ♥️
It&#39;s a chiclet keyboard with flat, island keys, I&#39;m 100% certain I&#39;m gonna have tone&#39;s of trouble typing on it.
Lol, hoping that in the long run AMD laptops will stay cheaper is a pipe dream. The moment the mainstream consumer catches on that AMD is better, prices will go up, sadly. <br>Though at least for right now, we have some killer deals!
Intel fanboy : Intel losing because they play around, if they get serious they will win<br>Intelligent People : This is the future old man, result over some all talk
The Vega Frontier at least...that willlll fallout well and the bandwidth buffferrr like that continued....sky&#39;s the Limit there....
16:9 is the best
I5 for a 1000 sounds a little steep.
Give me a 16 gb version for 700-710 and Im in
Let&#39;s get a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23sponser">#sponser</a> LTT shirt.
Gets excited looks up laptop .  Over 2 Grand In Australia :/
hello linus i am a fan of yours from india,i want to ask you that if there is any motherboard that can support i7 3820 of lga 2011 lineup my asus rampage 4 extreme just died and cant find any similler or low end motherboard for the processor
I spy with my little eye a set of dragon balls heh...
If they made it upgradeable. Oo0
Those shots were just amazing. Is that the probe lens. Probably. Glad I subscribed.
Are Best Buy’s still pick up only are can you go in like suggested at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m30s">7:30</a>
this is video is sponsored by <a href="http://lttstore.com/">lttstore.com</a><br>this.... is my whole weekend!!
Staples offers this laptop
Phew.. Luckily my employer hooks us up with powerful 3D modeling laptops. To top it off, they have a carbon fiber look to them. They&#39;re sick! They even out perform our 3D desktop workstations. Right tools for the job though right. They&#39;re both Dell btw 🤣🤫
hol&#39; up, the title used to be something on the lines of &quot;should you buy an intel laptop&quot; or something, now it&#39;s &quot;AMD Laptops - Faster, Longer Battery, and CHEAPER!&quot; wtf

How about AMD ThinkPad series?
I see you flexing on the Lenovo Flex 14 ;)
Can someone tell me this moron is a billionaire. Ive been seeing his PC builds etc. and its insanely expensive.
Is that a shiny new Laowa lens being used in this video?
HP got so Envy over there
The price can be even better. I bought the 15.6&quot; from Best Buy for 580. Costco had it for 600.
&quot;Now a segue to talk to you about AMD who sponsored this video&quot;<br>😂
I just.... 1080p tho-
I&#39;m trademarking &quot;softcore gaming&quot;
I find it disappointing when new laptops skip USB-C charging. When I eventually upgrade, I consider that a killer feature to simplify my traveling.
Those macro shots are amazing! Well done Andy Zhang!
I need asus Zephyrus g14 black colour with ryzen 9 where to buy not there in amazon
Did they mention if the speakers were good?

Watercool a water cooler
Nice hardware!...I dunno, I mean I can appreciate this craze for 16 x 10 and all?...but for me? 16 x 9 is fine, (seeing as how I do more reading and coding than anything else...and with a mouse and scroll wheel?..I&#39;m not concerned with the ratios!) and when you plug a ThinkPad X-1 Carbon into a 27&quot; 4K monitor?...the ratio issue disappears altogether, but still....I guess for those who do more traveling than I do?...it might be an make-or-break...deal breaker
why didn&#39;t you check Radeon Vega 6 in AMD Ryzen 5 4500U vs 1035G4?<br>its stupid not to run some games
how did you do this while playing fat prisoner simulator
I just bought HP Envy 15.6&quot; Full HD X360, AMD Ryzen 5 4500U, AMD Radeon Graphics, 8GB SDRAM, 256GB SSD for $599.  I like the bigger screen for $200 less.
Tip for widescreen display : put the taskbar on the side (right/left)
Nice AMD!, now i&#39;m Enjoying using R7 4800H
This is actually a great little laptop. I&#39;m definitely impressed
That Macro Shots Are Incredible,
16:9 ftw
Why do you recommend bad posture when typing on the keyboard? Even if it feels less comfortable for you, your hands should hover above the keyboard while typing. This is the ergonomic way to type and avoid ailments like RSI. Laptops are already bad enough with flat keyboards or keyboards that tilt upward from the user. This is similar to ergonomic chairs, where less expensive &quot;premium&quot; or &quot;gaming&quot; chair might feel more comfy, but ergonomic ones don&#39;t leave you sore after 8+ hours of work, and prevent back problems and other ailments down the line.
Every AMD laptop I have owned has died but I have never had a problem with intel laptops

NOOOOOOOOO YOU CAN&#39;T JUST CHOOSE A BETTER AND CHEAPER PRODUCT, YOU HAVE TO BUY MY OVERPRICED INTEL TRASH
I swear I was just looking at this laptop on Amazon and dismissed it...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> its actually 31% if 2071 is 100% of performance.<br>if 1426 is 100% performance than yes, Ryzen has +46% more.
Lets just hope he did not include game test using igpu it would be disaster (except for cs and dota)
Absolutely nothing to do with the video, but I recently saw a SSD called DC100 from Nimbus Data, and it is insane 3,5&quot; and 100TB, I would love to see some coverage of it on LTT
Does anyone else think that the laptop is flipping you off?
Swear it used to say Intel
I&#39;m no math genius but at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=2m00s">2:00</a> he says 45% higher and then shows a graph that says 36.888% higher.

Imagine thermal throttled with 2 heatpipes and 2 fans while the one with 1 fan 1 heatpipe barely did
both don&#39;t sit flat in the B roll ... silver is bent like a banana, seriously why cant manufactures use some metal to stop that.
Everyone hating on Lenovo Flex&#39;s but they really aren&#39;t that flexible. I own the newest one and until this video was shocked to hear it was &quot;flex&quot;ible, sturdiest laptop I&#39;ve owned.
&quot;I personally didn&#39;t have an issue with my tiny hands&quot;...We&#39;re in the same boat Linus. Smallhandgang where u at?











I want an AMD ultrabook with Thunderbolt and no dedicated graphics.
That looks like a straight cheap knock-off of an XPS13 2-in-1.
Your team&#39;s b roll is getting way better
I always forget that the prices are in us dollars and get my hopes up. My canadian rubles aren’t enough!



Damn, 1449$ for that ryzen 9 asus g14, oh man, the cheapest option of asus g14 in my country is 2300$ and the highest is 3300$
Im stuck with a F@cking probook x360 with a pentium n5000
only his hands are big?
Hot damn that was a smooth segway!
what&#39;s the segue ??? Glasswire...
All we&#39;re missing now is for AMD to use thunderbolt now that it&#39;s open source
Old title: <b>Intel vs AMD for Laptops</b>


Intel..... first, there goes their desktop market share, then their server space andddd now their laptop market too...<br>Long story short... says nobody<br>Intel... It&#39;s over....
14 hours on performance mode?
<a href="http://lttstore.com/">LTTStore.com</a>
I wish I had the cash to shop on <a href="http://lttstore.com/">LTTstore.com</a> for a whole weekend!
RIP Intel
I&#39;ll order my free sticker pack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m22s">4:22</a>. Thank you.
honestly tho the amount of crap that comes pre installed and crappy customer service makes me recommend everyone stay away from HP.
When you mention prices in your videos, are they in canadian dollars or us dollars?
The probe lens shots from yesterday’s video and today’s video are insane! I LOVE IT.
by the way, the original video name was: &quot;Are intel laptops even worth considering?&quot;


*Complains 16:9 is small. Checkmate, I&#39;m Asian
Linus can you review Asus Rog Zephyrus G14?

*Not to be confused with AMD Mobile GPU laptops
<b>I agree</b>
For everybody in the US, just so y&#39;all know, I work at Best Buy and we are currently selling the AMD Envy for $580 and the Ryzen 7 configuration for $750! Also you can upgrade the ram to 16gb for about $70 cause it only has 2 dims and they are both occupied by 2 4gb sticks so you have to replace instead of add. Just thought i&#39;d let y&#39;all know!
Unless this was the &quot;dont buy intel&quot; video, where did that one go?
&quot;Should you Even consider an Intel Laptop???&quot;
Ltt
I think you guys should stick with the dark mode intro!
Intel done
There most likely won&#39;t ever be a Ryzen version of the Spectre x360, considering that one came out of Intel&#39;s Project Athena. Same goes for X1 Carbon, XPS 13 and quite a few more. Here&#39;s to hope there will be a X1 Extreme/P1 with a Ryzen H.
laptop manufacturers finally moving back to a more square aspect ratio with 3:2, makes me laugh in 5:4 ThinkPad. typing comfort has been compromised for years now; not to mention the years of 1366x768 and 1600x900 TN garbage screens. :|
Can you stop with the deep fake
The title says it all! <br>Preach!
Does it have windows precision drivers?
LTT: &quot;quick, use an FX joke in the video!&quot;<br>Also LTT: &quot;crap, we can&#39;t...Kowalski,  make some graphs about some useless made up percentages that we can still bash AMD.&quot;<br>Kowalski: &quot;37.2% found the thumb travel to be a hindering factor. The female hand size of 54.2% found the space bar offensive and 78% kielbasa fingers had to retype.&quot; <br>LTT: &quot;that&#39;s right boys, we did it...barely..&quot;
The new hp logo looks like lip lol
Best purchase I&#39;ve ever made in a laptop! I love my x360 :)

Review Lenovo T14(s) with AMD ryzen please!!
Hey, gotta admit. That&#39;s the best segue so far
Ihope theres a giveaway because my laptop is aspire 4730z and it is windows vista and i cant play ang game and my online Class is on the way and i have no laptop to use i hope and my birthday is coming in 18 of July i hope LTT❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Can you please do a review on Lenovo C940 15&quot;???
Are those Time Spy scores only CPU scores or overall scores? I know Vega integrated GPUs are good enough but they can&#39;t be getting ~2500 in Time Spy. That&#39;s close to a 1050ti.
who remembers when the title was “should you even consider Intel laptops right now?”
Comparing HP envy to a spectre isn&#39;t a fair thing, they are entirely different forms and categories. Nowadays it feels like the LMG fair reviews quality is taking a dip.<br>And it&#39;s more important to judge a device how it performs on a day to day basis then just benchmarks.<br>No one buys laptops / compute devices to win or compete in benchmarks. This video doesn&#39;t even tell me how it performs in gaming/browsing /video editing etc the things that actually matter to the buyers.<br>Linus please take these into consideration for your future brand bashing. <br>PS it&#39;s all upto HP to decide to use or not to use a 6 core cpu in the models.. It&#39;s not fair to blame cpu manufacturers.


35W TDP CPU. Damn I was hoping for a low power AMD chip.
401 Intel engineers disliked this...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m22s">7:22</a> - Good advice during covid times. Go into a store and touch a keyboard others touch.
how does it compare to the omen 15?
is this fr? i got a ryzen 5 12gb ram for 550 dollars
The best part of this video is David looking very pleased with himself as he pretends to type something.
Hell yeah im waiting for thia guy for a year I was gonna get the last gen version but I waited yassss
Is it any good for gaming ?
Yo my ryzen 5 w/ 8gb ram and an ssd was 350 bucks and it slaps
What a difference, years ago you wouldn&#39;t touch AMD laptops as they were overly hot, noisy and bad on battery!!!
Like what ?!?!? what a segue
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m47s">6:47</a> Good information here. Happy to see it&#39;s not being left out.
GET YOUR BANANA OFF OF THAT KEYBOARD YOUNG MAN!!!
Messenger notification <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=1m38s">1:38</a> ?
good god those shot of the inside of the laptops were amazing
AMD Fanboy is here. Too happy...
I can&#39;t wait to see what Intel&#39;s answer to all this is, they&#39;ve sorely needed competition but I doubt they&#39;ll be sitting on their hands too much longer. With Apple officially ditching intel soon as well....

Who&#39;s watching this in 2018
Whta is Dross doing in our videos man !! ?? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=2m41s">2:41</a>
I think I7-10710u/1065g7 is the only worthy intel ultra book chip, coming from MSI Prestige 14 (-0.1v undervolt+liquid metal+extra heat-pipe). <br>I am able to match my older I7-8850H (-0.125v undervolt+liquid metal+2 extra heatpipe) to within 5% of cinebench R20 scores
That shot around 30 seconds is so satisfying
Idk if this is a dumb question, but if this configuration of the Envy x360 13 is so good, is the Envy x360 15 AMD Ryzen 7 4700U also great?
After watching the last video i just dont know if the game that i&#39;m seeing, is truly linus
Never go baby face again...
Multi Shredded Benchmarks
This is the only Segway that actually got me
Its so weird hearing &quot;making the jump to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>&quot;... why did we ever leave it 😭
I smirked at the segway pre-message.
you guys could and should totally make a video on every single time the size of linus&#39; hands has come up. lol
The Envy360 15.6” with the 4500u was $599 at Costco last month. Picked it up for my wife and she is digging it.
Great segway to the first sponsor
Im still using  8yo old Dell xps L702x for basic work every day (most demanding tasks are statistics in Rstudio) and I dont understand companies that put 6 core cpu into maschine thats thic as my cutting board from IKEA and have problem to accomodate full size usb port. Whats that good for? Just dont use 6 core, 4ghz cpus, If you are targeting casual market, that doesnt care about performance as much as they care about desing. My  ancient sandybridge in 4kg laptop does not thermat throttle, beacuse it sound like jet engine under load and weights more than a average new born, thats what you used to expect of high end laptop.
You won&#39;t read it but These new B-roll angles are beyond satisfying, great job LTT :D
PSA: This machine with this exact configuration is currently $579.99 US at <a href="http://bestbuy.com/">bestbuy.com</a>, which is an absolutely absurd deal.
The laptop looks kinda bigger in linuses hands
Me: gets excited because there is a new version of my envy<br><br>Also me: all of my complaints are still there and now it doesn&#39;t have windows hello or pen.


Intel: we&#39;re more expensive tho
LMAO how do they read my mind like this?? I literally brought home my Envy x360 today, after downgrading from a Spectre. And then this was the first video I have seen from my new Envy.<br> COULD. NOT. AGREE. MORE.<br>BTW, you can get the 15&quot; 4500u at best buy right now for $579 which is an ABSOLUTE STEAL (I went with the 4700u for $749 since they&#39;re out of stock on the lower end locally - Btw this one scored 3251 on Cinebench r20. No that&#39;s not a typo).


intel fanboys malding OMEGALUL
<b>throws the banana for scale</b> <br>Linus: didn&#39;t we do that on another video somewhere?
If HP makes a Spectre version of this, they better include Thunderbolt. There is NO technical reason why it can&#39;t be added to AMD machines.


Is it just me or is the video slowed
Still waiting on an AMD laptop with TB3 and a decent screen. Most of them have crap screens and as far as I&#39;m aware none have TB3. Considering TB3 has been license free for a while now and USB4 is also a thing, I can only assume that AMD laptops don&#39;t get TB3 because they&#39;re only in cheap laptops for now. Same with the general lack of decent screens.<br><br>Hopefully the next round will see AMD chips in the Spectre line so it won&#39;t be so gimped compared to Intel laptops from years past. Cause those CPU specs are nice and all, but not at a trade off. Pretty sure if they put AMD chips into a Spectre laptop it&#39;ll be an instant buy for me as soon as it gets a decent discount (Black Friday, please!).
Anyone else more intrigued by the Dragon Balls in the back near the end of the video that then display of the laptop? lol
Why do you hate intel so much?
i am huge i5 fan for many years now but this ryzen 5 4500u chip is the new mvp
Why didn&#39;t you compare it to the hp envy 13
Apple should’ve gone with AMD instead of Apple Silicon
I got the Ryzen 7 version, which in the UK comes with 512gb and 16gb ram, both double the R5 specs.  Well worth the little extra, especially the 512gb, it let&#39;s you breathe.  The only disappointment (coming from a Surface Pro 2 lol) was the microsd card reader leaves the card proud by about 1mm, so you can&#39;t leave the card in permanently for expanded storage.  No regrets though.
RED OR BLUE PILL?
Don&#39;t make me watch the G14 video for a 5th time now come on...<br>Kidding I can&#39;t get over these. MOAR AMD LAPTOPS
Can you do a comparison with Dell inspiron 14 2 in 1 with ryzen? Looks a more premium build but I&#39;m in doubt about the display.
damn i missed the original title
Would like to know how good standby battery life is. The more important thing for me though is - did they solder the ram again? I really can&#39;t imagine working with 8GB even on something this compact.
This laptop is selling for 579.99 at Best Buy atm. It’s freaking insane.
take a look at the asus zenbook q407l it has a ryzen 5 4500u 8gb ram 256gb ssd and mx 350 graphics for $700 at best buy its what ive been using for a month now and its amazing. but the battery life isnt as good at around 7 hours.
Anyone noticed HP new logo on this laptop? yea look pretty cool and simple right. 👍👍 Double thumbs up for designer.
But Intel and Nvidia are using dirty politic, order OEM to not use AMD chip. So very rare laptop with Zen 2 and Navi mobile.
HP: &quot;Intel, we have to talk.&quot;<br>Intel: &quot;... Fuck.&quot;
8 GB ram usually not enough
I got that Envy model for 550 at best buy two weeks ago 👌👌
Now if they could make it a freesync 75hz display, that would be a nice gaming laptop.
top end $700 windows laptop: 14 hour battery life.<br>$200 chromebook: 24 hour battery life and is immune from viruses
You are so pr0
Hope intel loses customers, so that they stop overpricing stuff.
I remember i once bought an amd laptop, I&#39;ve had a terrible experience with amd gpus before so i wasn&#39;t a fan but i decided to give them another shot. The piece og shit had 3 blue screens while i was just trying to update the graphics drivers. Never trying amd again

Nope. I wouldn&#39;t own an HP even if they gave me one for free.
Love the probe lens shots
I still wonder if AMD processer will get hot after two years. I experienced a few AMD processer getting hot after two years or more
Why thew heck would they go through the effort of designing a hinged plug just to fit an obsolete type A USB in there haha. Its obsolete guys. The only reason why they still exist is because manufacturers keep cheaping out and putting them in devices like this. Be like Apple and go all out USB-C/Thunderbolt.
Please review the 4500U equipped Lenovo Flex 5 for 599
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m49s">0:49</a> and “BLock” it instantly!
It&#39;s $10 off the headphones, not $20. Lame.
that HP envy wit hthe 4500u will run overwatch in 1080p at medium settings 70fps. crazy for a basic APU
Costco carries that HP envy x360 with a 512gb  version of the same SSD for the same price and a Full keyboard with the hp touch stylus included.
Its Bang and Olufsen speaker, not as good as Harman Kardon on Asus Zenbook, to many high freq noises
Now I&#39;m no fanboy, I&#39;m not in love with any particular company by any stretch (the closest I guess I&#39;d be is Logitech&#39;s MX Master line, but that&#39;s just because I like the specific products) but I genuinely can&#39;t see any reason to go Intel at the moment? AMD is pushing higher core counts at equal or higher speeds at lower prices on the desktop, and they&#39;re pushing higher speeds, more cores, better battery life and lower costs on laptops and I can&#39;t see where Intel is going to claw things back in the next year or two based on Intel&#39;s roadmap. <br>I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll come back with something to beat AMD in a couple years, but for now it&#39;s not looking good...
Linus should convince OEMS to adopt more AMD... They are bribed by Intel now
We&#39;ve already seen degradation in amd desktop cpus. What do u think is going to happen with laptop cpus? Its funny how everyone is on amds D and nobody talks about how intel is still beating amd in games on a 10year old architecture.  Amd is doing better but do we have to constantly talk smack about the intel side just because amd is finally competing.  Seems low and biased to me.
Wake me Up when anything AMD has for $350 Challenges my 3 year old 8700K at 5Ghz all Core. 6 Intel Core still beat 8 AMD Cores or are within 10%.
* Intel has left the chat
If AND sticks to low-mid ranges then Intel won
Andy is going to be a presenter soon(within 7-10 months is my prediction). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m15s">4:15</a> is (i think) the first time that he has spoken to the camera on an LMG vid.
Someone seems to have a new probe lens
just kinding
poooooooo
is it just me or does linus sound like micheal scott.
That banana for reference got me Lol
Costco has the 15.6&quot; model with 8GB RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a Ryzen 5 4500U for just $599.99. Crazy.








those 2 laptops.... the keyboards are disgusting especially the arrow keys and it doesnt have numpads
Say, isn&#39;t this what the call the flawless victory?
So this laptop is available on touchscreen?
How long until we start seeing 4:3 aspect ratios come back? We&#39;ve slowly been creeping away from widescreen back toward a square-ish aspect ratio.

AMD Laptop: <b>cheaper</b>                                       Me in Thailand: So that is a f**king lie
This is the seed planted, hopefully it will grow into a laptop I actually consider worth saving for.
You guys just forgot to mention about upgrading it, knowing HP as I know, a laptop like that must have sodered RAM and proprietary cable on the ssd, so dont even think about upgrading HP recent laptops...
I would really like to buy one but the display is the big issue, cruddy 55% SRGB panel they use in all the budget laptops :/ really hope they do a specter and Intel hasn&#39;t made arrangements to discourage them
Bruh there&#39;s a laptop with same thing and more ram but is 500 bucks, it&#39;s a Lenovo IdeaPad

I HAD to get a new laptop, so  settled for the GS75 Stealth from MSI, which of course was Intel inside. But next one is definitely gonna be AMD. Just a solid GPU, AMD processor and perfect color depth screen (with minimal bezels) and i&#39;m SOLD
Why are pc trackpads still shity? Since 2009 MacBook have perfect trackpads, how is it possible 10 years later to still have this kind of trackpads ???
Let&#39;s be honest, who cares about Windows Hello.
This version is a great spec update, too bad that with each generation the ENVY x360 haves something missing from the previous iteration that makes no sense (unless they want to make the Specter line look better).<br>Somethings 2020 ENVY x360 lost from the 2019 version-<br>- They moved the power button from one of the sides to the keyboard, this makes it unreachable on presentation position and uncomfortable in tent or tablet positions.<br>- Even worse, now the power button is a key on the keyboard in a awkward place (left of delete button).<br>- Lost the right CTRL key to place the fingerprint reader!!! in a awful place.<br>- The camera privacy switch is replaced with a FN key combo.<br>- As pointed in the video, they reduced the bottom bezel,. Most likely to make the laptop shorter, but I think they should have made the laptop even taller, doing so they could have enlarged the palm rest, give a bigger track pad and probably a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> aspect ratio screen.<br>- That &quot;big&quot; bottom bezel was useful to hold the PC in tablet mode and have a place to rest/grab with your thumb.<br>- This reduction in height also also meant that they had to remove the top firing speakers (previous models had 4 speakers,  2 of them above the keyboard)<br>- Now USB-A ports have this hinge/trapdoor/flap while previous versions had standard regular full size USB-A ports (while the 2018 and 2019 computers even a few millimeters thinner)<br><br>The 2019 version also had a couple of drawbacks vs the 2018 model<br>- Lost the side volume rocker<br>- Lost the Windows Hello facial recognition function, but at least it gained the fingerprint reader (without losing any key)<br>- The Damascus steel pattern that was laser etched to the back is gone too, it was of no usefulness but it gave the laptop a even more premium feel.<br>Don&#39;t get me wrong this computer seems great, I have the 2018 version as my daily driver and it still is a formidable machine in every aspect. My experience till now is so good that I didn&#39;t hesitated to recommend it to my sister when she needed to replace her computer (she got the 2019 version).
Yes Linus i bought it 1 month ago :)<br>(15inch 16GB and 512GB SSD for 850€ )
How pity intel now, they got abandoned by apple and humiliated by amd...what a shame...
No thunderbolt tho :(
Hi there I really like your channel and i always wanted to start a YouTube channel but I can&#39;t because i don&#39;t have a gaming pc so i will be really happy if you give me a gaming pc and this is my dream i hope you read this 🙏🏼
This is cool and all but when is the ltt twomad collab going to happen?
Love your videos! Is the HP envy 15 review coming out soon?
Can confirm HP&#39;s new AMD laptops are great. Got a Probook with a 4700U last month and I love it.<br><br>I DON&#39;T love the prices they charge for upgrades, so I got the base with the only upgrades being the 4700U and IR webcam and bought 16GB of ram and an nvme ssd of my own and saved like $400-500.
It doesn&#39;t have usable mouse buttons, so it&#39;s GARBAGE!

I hate HP
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m21s">0:21</a> what is this dy laptop
























I need the number pad on the side, I can&#39; do with having a small layout like that.

I am a sophomore in highschool and have been looking for a good laptop for me. I have 1k budget, any recommendations? I&#39;ve been thinking of MacBook air but also a Dell. Any good laptop recommendations?
I feel like Linus is using deep fake again
Nice stuff, i think i&#39;ll buy one (no, not the underwear...^^) - and btw: use a can of pressurized air on the stuff you want to macro - looks way more professional^^
Can this play valorant well? Been doing research on AMD but not sure entirely if this can game well
Is that a random Astera in the corner? :)
But I prefer 16:9.  Video fits much better on that.  Black bars make me rage.  So the screen ratio is a plus for me, even if it isn&#39;t for other people.
So the Dell XPS 15 review is never going to come out huh. . .
<a href="http://lttstore.com/">LTTStore.com</a>
No memory upgrades, I guess .
Wow but am still broke
I&#39;m crying over my £430 laptop
Man HP SKUs seem messed up either internationally or from previous gens, my Envy x360 with the R5 2500U has Windows hello on it and that was £650 plus non soldered ram
I would have bought my laptop with an AMD, but the configurations were considerably worse. That&#39;s a big issue with AMD laptops (especially mid-range ones).
Could this be a replacement for my surface as a student?
damn   hinged usb-a :D im guessing a hinged rj-45 is impossible at this thickness now
HP makes quality stuff. I&#39;m watching on an HP 15.6 laptop with an intel core i5. Just wish the battery life was a bit better.
I want a good gaming laptop for 500 to 600 dollars any suggestions
Bruh $800 USD is almost $2k USD in Australia
that battery life can last you basically 2 school days if you only use it at school, say you have a PC at home so you shut it down then. I&#39;m already happy if i can go 2 classes with my battery life XD
Lol I seriously watch these videos to see the  super  smooth  segways
Check out the Lenovo flex 5 14. 🔥🔥🔥
at this point im gonna remove my i7 sticker on my laptop
I like how LTT&#39; s ad can be skipped in just one double tap of 10 seconds. Just perfect. &lt;3
Companies should make more mid tier to high end spec&#39;d laptops.
What about MUX?
I&#39;m so sorry for anyone who happen to buy Intel or NVIDIA stock yesterday 😆😂
I bought an amd 4000 laptop and had docker issues unfortunately had to return it and buy intel
if only it had front facing speakers like the previous envy x360 generation and a oled screen it&#39;d be the best on couch / in bed movie watching laptop on the planet
My Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 laptop is a MONSTER.  The 8c/16t 4800HS hits 4.4ghz regularly and maintains 4.2-4.3ghz while all 16 threads are under sustained load.  The RTX 2060 Max-Q boosts to 2010Mhz and runs between 1541-1740mhz while gaming.  I Max out every setting at the native FHD resolution in every game and enable/max out Ray Tracing.  Even so, this thing&#39;s still getting well into the 48-120hz refresh rate of its display.  The overall quality, sound quality, Speed and gaming performance are phenomenal.  I put a 2tb SSD in there so I can store and play more games.  Charging via the USB port with your phone charger is very nice and a whole lot more.  This is The laptop to get if you want high performance computing in a 3.5lb 14&quot; laptop that looks great in a meeting and will game, edit, whatever like an absolute boss when you want it to.  💯
Ummmm...<br>The envy x360 has been out for a while
This is literally the single most helpful video about computers (for me)
watching this on my envy x360, honestly such a good laptop.










More Cheaper* <br><br><br><br>There fixed.
I may actually pick up one of these AMD 4000 laptop; so I can play my steam games on the bus.
Time will come when laptops are going to be like phones wherein midrange are the new flagships.
Upgradability?
Those Probe lens shots were awesome!!!🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♀️🕵️‍♀️
About keyboard... remember that some of us are asians
I thought I told that guy to bite his thumb when he misunderstood Thinkpads. Hard. Advice, which, had he taken it, might have allowed him to make better use of this machine with a shorter digit.<br>Maybe he can swap in a DualPoint keyboard so he can avoid his unfortunate habit of using a touchscreen with his thumb.<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-730794-001-Keyboard-Dualpoint-pointing/dp/B00IY1INM4">https://www.amazon.com/HP-730794-001-Keyboard-Dualpoint-pointing/dp/B00IY1INM4</a>
Now this is something I would actually buy or be able to afford from a LTT video
I bought all AMD for the first time in my life, been making PCs for about 20 years and I have to say... my experience has been absolute shit. Tons of driver issues, blue screens etc. I bought hardware that was released in september 2019, bought it in february 2020, and some of the crashes were just resolved within the last two months. Never had issues like this with Intel based architecture, so in my opinion the stability is something you&#39;ve got to consider in the price. Cheaper, faster, blah blah blah... great, but if I&#39;m bluescreening while doing my work and then losing all my data that&#39;s bullshit. <br><br>Never bought AMD before, likely won&#39;t again. I can&#39;t justify saving $100 on a build when it&#39;s going to crash.
ah yes<br>i bought that thing 2 weeks ago<br>4700U, 16gb ram, 1tb rom, 400nit display (yes, that&#39;s an option)<br>really pleased so far




























I&#39;m glad manufacturers are making more AMD chipset laptops, finally laptops are more cheaper. Now if only the gaming and premium laptops can have more AMD options than Intel ones
Yeaaaa! This machine will be priced 1-1.2k dollars in my country! 🙂✌️ 👍 💪 🤙 ✌️ 👌 👌 👌 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Can you guys make a video showing budget wheel and pedals pls.
STOP.<br>USING.<br>GENIUS.<br>LINK SHORTENERS<br>THEY ONLY WORK IN LIKE HALF A DOZEN COUNTRIES.<br>THANK YOU,<br>THE WHOLE FUCKING THIRD WORLD THAT GIVES YOU A TINY LITTLE BIT OF MONEY BY WATCHING YOUR VIDEOS.
Endurance and longevity aren&#39;t the same thing, Linus.
Can you play AAA on low in this APU? Do you still need a MX DGPU to play at low or you could skip it all over if 1050/1650 isn&#39;t available on this APU?
Sounds like AMD is better than Intel at this point, but i am now going to build my pc and i&#39;ve decided on AMD Ryzen 5 3600X for my good cost /power build, is There any Intel that is better than this for same or lower price  ?
tfw Linus isn&#39;t even trying anymore and just says &quot;what&#39;s a segway?&quot; and goes right into an ad



Intel ...Meh
I don&#39;t like glasswire. I&#39;m never going to use it.
I&#39;m interested in this AMD - HP x360 laptop. Can it manages  small editing with Premiere with 1080p videos?


damn. amd, stop. its already dead! this is beyond brutal
Let&#39;s see if apple&#39;s new cpus can compare
It looks like cat got comfy on David&#39;s shirt
The absolute domination of AMD over Intel kinda makes me wish they would get involved in mobiles cpus and create a new architecture that would dominate Qualcomm and their monopoly.

















👏👏👏 that’s awesome news. Finally they are adopting amd
Anticipating Vermeer will  have a low power process performance mobile w/dGPU as well as a frequency performance desktop design. All in One; Renoir, is actually a desktop APU that slotted nicely on competitive product timing in a low power mobile form factor opportunity. Renoir ramp will confirm if, or if not Vermeer mobile, as IDMs will know about it and regulate their Renoir production. On Intel, If Rocket Lake S at all, Intel aims for 6 GHz. mb

Hell is frozen... Because their servers run Ryzen on water.
Why would you want a 3:2 aspect ratio? What am I missing here?
so  just to begin i  have that thing(envy 360x) with a 500gb ssd and a ryzen 5 3500 (i bought this like half a year ago or sth - 1 genn older) and i mostly agree with this video.<br>normally i have not enough hands on experience or money to talk about products presented here(and i really like this channel and the guys), but here are 2  things i would like to add.<br>first off, this thing can run pretty warm in use(i have no hands on comparison with other laptops but i know one or two things about semiconductors).<br>my sollution was a coolermaster laptopstand mounted  with 2 12v noctua 12ax25 fans with a speed controller by noctua and a 5  to12 v adapter for roughly 100 $ or € idk.<br>the second thing is the ram.<br>if money is an issue this product is totally fine with 8 gb, but 16 gb of ram would be a significant improvement(i have the 8gb version).<br>fyi 8gb is fine for workinng and all, which i do, but i often feel the limitations and would recommend the 16 gb version,  trust me.<br>So if you got the 250$ extra,  get  the 16 gb version of this( with even a better processor than i and the 800$ version have-and if you have have 100$  extra get  the cooler for longevity).<br>If not this product is totally fine and i would still recommend this to anyone.<br> i can´t tell you about the handling, as my hands are pretty normal and  i think it works perfectly fine.<br>so  mabe there could be a difference because my laptop was a 1 gen older model...probably.(if you dont know it is a  invertible touchpad... i don´t  know what to tell you man....  still thumbs up)<br>if somebody would like to know more i could  post some links....if i have time<br>(for gaming you shouldn´t expect too much, but i don´t really use it for that- it´s a notebook guys)<br><br>conclusion: toptally recommend it- if you are looking for something like this in this  price-range(spectre can be double the price)<br>                     still i am glancing at the spectre( the name of this model is envy :D), but that was  500-1000$ more.<br> and i had to buy a touchpad pen extra...ripoff<br>idk i am some random dude... don´t trust me
Two sponsors in one video?<br>Me!
AMD seems to be taking a sizable lead across multiple market segments. Would love to hear a discussion why this is and how sustainable the lead is.
I literally just bought a hp envy x360 (intel i7 10th gen 12gb ram) yesterday...
I&#39;m in love with those close up shots 😍😍.
Diggin the Obi-Wan look.
Wow I feel like an idiot for buying the Zenbook 14
The shots with the probe lens could use better color correcting.
Can someone tell me why a 3:2 aspect ratio is better than 16:9? I personally think 16:9 is the perfect ratio of height and width for whatever I’m doing watching tv or typing on a word document. 3:2 seems blocky and I feel less immersed which is definitely important for gaming and watching tv.

thanks AMD, now i own a 4800h laptop without selling my kidney
I smile each time I hear a AMD Renoir review.....<br>Poor Intel....only gaming is it&#39;s safe heaven now...for now...
Are there any AMD laptops with Thunderbolt 3? Because if I&#39;m using a laptop it&#39;s going to be docked the vast majority of the time. If there was, I&#39;d buy it and put Linux on it to have a LInux sandbox without dual booting or virtualizing. Would let me test out my KVM switch as well (which I got for whenever I get a newer work laptop with TB3, but COVID 19 means I haven&#39;t been back to the office to get a new one).
How long was key travel?
It really should of been compared to the xps 13 though :)
Shit, my sony viao E series intel core i3 only lasts about 2 to 3 hours unpluged  =x
I’m getting $10 off my first purchase. Any idea why?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m58s">6:58</a> so its gonna be an issue for 68% of men, and 50% of females,  so on average, it&#39;s gonna be an issue, for...around 68% of males? plus minus?


Is it possible t upgrade the Ram in the future (for example go for 16 gb) ?
Hey linus any reason why you could make a pcie cable extension instead of a ribbon extension
16/9 is much better for multimedia consumption, like Youtube and Netflix. So HP doing something more multimedia focus than productivity it&#39;s a very pleasant thing to see. Btw tablet mode for multimedia is awesome. Take notes Linus ;)
it&#39;s nice to see that the times have changed enough for there to be competition in the portable computing market.
8gb ram is just not enough these days for a laptop.. unfortunately when you have 16gb ram the price takes a big jump
Look at all the stickers on that thing! Lmfao come on man these companies are goofy with that

Ayo I need the envy expeditiously
My envy has the Ryzen 5 and Windows hello
I bought the XPS 17. With Intel 8core. It has a PL1 limit of 75 watts. Hilarious XD
Apparently it doesn&#39;t have TB3, which is a no go for me personally, since I&#39;m using a external GPU.<br>Currently I&#39;m using a Dell Latitude 7390, which I&#39;m still ok with, but want to replace soon.<br>So, long issue short: Is there a configuration of the Envy x360 with TB3? (I really couldn&#39;t find any helpful info about that on the HP website)
Original title: Should you Even CONSIDER an Intel Laptop?


Okay, so y&#39;all need to know this. So the reason this laptop is being made is because Intel LITERALLY CANT MAKE ENOUGH PROCESSORS FOR HP&#39;S COMPUTERS. This computer is a message to Intel that if they dont get their supply issues up, they&#39;ll completely go towards AMD.
no game benches??
REEEEEEW
Low-key that ball spin was sweet
CANT you just take out the proccesor from one and put in the other or just buy a specter without a cpu and buy one of the amd ones?
It doesn&#39;t matter how much processing power and storage it has when it&#39;s already 90% full of undeletable bloatware out of the box. FUCK HP
linus: likee whats a segue<br><br>speaking of segue now to our sponsor glasswire 😆
Yo so I got a question for all the smart people in the comments, so I was building my first pc and I have everything connected properly but when I go to turn it on nothing happens. So I was wondering if you guys would have some clues for mistakes that beginners make so I can fix the computer
I would suggest folks wait 4 months for Spectre x360/AMD version. As trends go, it&#39;s going to happen. <br>Better quality - More power - Camera on/off switch - AX WiFi - Medium/High Level Gaming - more secure all around.<br>This is my opinion based on my predictions. - Just say&#39;n! ;O)-
Dig the macro footage
HP not for me but Asus is for me....
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m49s">0:49</a> linus so exited he falls back into puberty
Linus:  &quot;I fully recommend an Hp product&quot;<br>Hp: *Shits pants.
I still don&#39;t get the inclusion of a <i>MicroSD</i> slot as a positive, I can&#39;t imagine someone using that micro slot often enough to justify it existing. I would much rather they put* in a normal sized SD slot, at least then I can* work on photography stuff much more easily.
Now we just need laptop manufacturors that will integrate the AMD processors.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> nOt
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=5m49s">5:49</a> Please no more USB-C charging port, the DC port is fine.. It&#39;s more solid, less likely to get damaged and it makes better contact for current..

And in the UK the same laptop is $1000
I&#39;d really like to have a 1440p laptop to replace my 15yo Dell Laptop that is running strong w/ SSD and Win7
I&#39;m really digging these super close camera angles! keep it up
No number keypads on them?  Pass.
Bananas for scale. 👍🏼😂
Imagine being as big as LTT and not being able to get the video size right when rendering, giving everyone with a long phone screen a beautiful black rectangle of unused screen space.


I think it’s safe to say that intel will be virtually gone by the end of the year
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m02s">6:02</a> my eyes, my eyes
No LTE option on the spectre in Germany. I asked the support. They don&#39;t know, when or if it will come....
No
Is it touch screen?
I&#39;ve been waiting so long for y&#39;all to do a review of this
It beat the XPS in performance? Wtf Dell, literally everyone is going to wait another year for your next model instead XD
Loving my x360 (3500U 15&quot;). Though this in 15&quot; would be the ticket for me.
linus can you make video building a $500 gaming pc? im saving up money to build one
Rumor has it if you put your ear to the comment section you can hear 1000 Intel fanboys screaming.
Linus was bought by amd
Hmmm title changed
Reeeeaaally looking forward to what other OEMs will do with ryzen, this is looking really good already
It is amusing to see laptops going back to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a>
I just built my first pc
It’s so weird that HP only offering 8 GB ENVY X360 13 at some regions, I really wanna the 16 GB version! 🙄
craziest thing about the battery test is that the spectre had 10 more watt hours. 60 vs 50 for the envy. That is crazy good coming from and efficiency.

Ok that was the best segue I&#39;ve ever seen
&quot;My hands are just too big&quot;<br>Damn, no need to flex on us Alex
You guys are having fun with your probe lense,<br>or you had it before and i never realized XD<br>nice vid
Wait...hp?! i thought it was a dq!!
Linus, have you had a chance to look at the 15&quot; version of this model? Whether or not you have, two questions for both 13 &amp; 15 inch versions:<br><br>In addition to the NVMe drive mentioned in the specs, does it also offer a 2.5&quot; bay for a second drive? Or maybe a second NVMe header?<br><br>Is the memory soldered / how many slots are available?<br><br>I have the 2018 Intel version and might consider upgrading.
I&#39;ve checked using the Amazon link : I see an Intel laptop.
&quot;Biden is a vegetable&quot;
Why there is very few amd laptop to buy in shops! Wtf is happening !
&quot;don&#39;t look at benchmarks, look at real world performance like MS-Paint drawing&quot;    -Intel, 2020


Does anyone else feel like buying this laptop even though you don&#39;t need it?
It&#39;s absolutely insane how much better amd mobile is compared to Intel&#39;s chips this generation. That too in literally every single category that matters, not just one or two
Psychology with Linus S2 E3: What is a segway?
Who is watching during the pandemic. Unless you are from the future. 😂
Thunderbolt 3, WiFi 6, better build quality and extra display brightness in the Spectre is worth way more than the extra performance of the Envy. This is by no means a fair comparison. You simply can&#39;t take 2 products that aren&#39;t even in the same range and compare them, the sample size is simply too small.
yes yes yes, amd is finally doing what i always thought they could!
Good
This year I went from Intel Pentium on Asus Vivobook $350 from 2012 to Dell Inspiron 1500 with i5. Barely noticed any major differences in performance
the underdog AMD now dominates!
If only I could get a r9 in an xps
With that money I took the Asus with Intel i7-8565u which in my opinion is better in almost everything as a laptop,as raw power and as battery life the laptop is 14&quot; inch screen fit in 13.3&quot; chassie
16:9 aspect ratio accommodates 1920x1080 perfectly. You&#39;re asking for an aspect ratio from 10 years ago to make a comeback in modern laptops because what? A fashion trend? gtfo with your bs opinion. Panel manufacturers murdered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> on purpose nearly a decade ago. Now it&#39;s an &quot;upgrade&quot;? Please. Get the hell out.
I just Bought a new i7, I have zero problems with intel.
someone please answer this how do i buy the Heat-sink for ASUS ROG STRIX 2060 super. only the heat sink and dual fans
I was going to pick this up for my wife but Best Buy has the Asus Zenbook with the same processor and an MX350 for $100 less than the envy. Looks like I couldn’t have gone wrong either way
the only reason why everybody actually sticks through all of your products schilling and watches your sponsors advertisement is because of your funny segways... <br><br>It actually makes me want to watch the ad.
why not review the ideapad 5 with a 4500u amd processor 4.1 ghz on all 6 core, and the gpu boosting to 1500mhz 16 gb of ram running at 3200mhz and a not so good ips display but you will love this the price i got mine from officedepot  for 479 u.s dollars. thats a steal.
I almost want to go out and get a second AMD laptop like this just for the battery life and extra portability.  I love my MSI Bravo 15 (which apparently you can&#39;t find anymore)!
3:2 and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> are incredible :)<br>You should show how to increase FOV in games with Mods or without them. That higher screens can also show the same horizontal angle.<br>That 3:2 sceens not only are good for productivity.
What lens were you using to get the close shots of the fans at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=3m09s">3:09</a> ?
I&#39;ve had the envy X360 with a 4 core / 8t 3700U cpu for a while now, it&#39;s amaaaazing!
power button above backspace??? WHY
ITS SUCH A SICK LAPTOP I got mine for 550 USD
HP laptops are bad. There&#39;s a reason they&#39;re less expensive... they don&#39;t last very long. Usually stupid problems with power delivery. Build quality is not good, screens are always bad. Don&#39;t buy.
Please please <b>please</b> review the Lenovo x13 and t14 amd variants
I&#39;m not buying the barrel power connector for cost savings thing... Lenovo manages to use USB-C charging on their cheap E series thinkpads...
So I got HP envy x360 and experence was awfull... I mean I bougth more than year ago and it has AMD Ryzen 2500u and it&#39;s fast, but battery life was fine on saving mode but then it started to bluescreened on me until I realized that power saving mode was cause of it and I only did after I bougth it to RMA for checkup and they failed to reproduce issue. HP laptops with AMD GPUs are still awfull driver wise, had plenty of issue with 2012 laptop now it&#39;s same on 2018 laptop. Envy models are not changing a lot, just newer chipsets and CPUs.
Nice probe lens bro 👍
Me:<br>Nobody at all:<br>Andy: THIS IS MY WHOLE WEEKEND

Finally you ltt review the hp envy line up been waiting for these bad boys for a while for my internship hopefully this year damn you covid
The asian man needs more airtime linus -_- he’s just too funny and the sole reason I liked the video.
Very happy with my Lenovo Ideapad 5 15&quot;. AMD Ryzen 7 4700U.<br>$575. Only bad thing is that the memory is fixed at 8GB.
I&#39;ve been thinking about a new laptop, but not at that price range. Would be nice to see LTT do a low end round-up. Especially given the nature of the economy and needing to spend less...

<b>MSI were selling the GL65 Leopard with an i7-10750h and an RTX 2070 - 115 watt version no less - for $1399 with a 512 GB SSD and 16 GB dual channel DDR4-2666</b><br>If you are a GAMER - that is the sort of machine to buy!<br>This is what my brother JUST bought 2 weeks ago!

Linus: wha a Segway!? Me: idk I always skip so 🤷🏾‍♂️
cant wait for a lg gram with amd!

You know, it’s uncommon that you get these levels of competition in such a small market. I’m loving it
lol bought my hp envy a few months ago =D. looks like i was doing the right thing
Damn. Those close up shots were killer!
Simply LOVED close up shots of the laptops components inside. More of that please. Like.
team red FTW
Is the ram upgradeable, or is there a 16GB version of this too?
I don&#39;t have a problem with the aspect ratio, but I wish it had a 512GB SSD at least for that price. Kinda expensive for only 256GB
as i am not a gamer i got a Lenovo V15 Ryzen 5 8GB 256GB SSD 15.6&quot; Win10 Home Laptop for £436.  so much better than my old i3 laptop.
I own the model with the 2500u, and while its performance is good especially for the money, the battery life is poor. this new x360 is a gamechanger
More amd laptops please
Barrel chargers are great. You can rig them up a new one if the brick fails. Without formed out a hundred dollars
Trackpads don&#39;t bother me with my large hands as a mouse will always be much better. If you&#39;re doing real work you&#39;re going to be at a desk anyway. For the rest, any modern trackpad will be good enough.
AMD. AMD. AMD!
wallpaper?
I don&#39;t like HP.
I know it doesn&#39;t come with a pen, but does it have pen support?
The last HP Envy I purchased started burning on my table back in January in a case of spontaneous combustion. And if that wasn&#39;t bad enough, the HP Support totally screwed me over. So HP is a hard NO from me, thank you sir, but NO THANK YOU. My new Ryzen 4 notebook will be anything else, but not HP. Never again!
I get that you just got the probe lens, but that kind of lens is best used sparingly, so the shots are really special.<br>I feel like the sweeping close shots are overused in this video.

The Ryzen 2000 and 3000 series of the Envy x360 had a decent premium feel as well with the same ports (meaning one of the USB-C is for charging!)
Wrong
I&#39;m always a little pleased by when Linus is sponsored by DROP
I&#39;m not a tech person but was recommended an HP Envy x360. But I can&#39;t tell the 2018 model apart from 2020 by the box from a computer shop. The salesman didn&#39;t know either. <br><br>So how can I tell 2018 from 2020? What&#39;s the difference in the physical appearance?
Serious Linus what is up with you always mention Windows Hello?<br>IMO it sucks A$$ anyway since it rarely works... my GF&#39;s computer&#39;s (both the &quot;old&quot; one and the new one i just bought for her 2 months ago) always let me login even tho i&#39;m not registered in her computer&#39;s.<br>Dosent make me think much of the windows hello thing...

I got Linus ad before Linus video
As the Segway careers from side to side, smashing into the wall before finally turning the corner… God I love this channel
Got the ryzen 4700u option with 16 gb of ram, its kinda too fast for what you would use an ultra-book for. Great gaming machine in disguise, runs csgo perfectly. For anyone who is thinking to use it as a linux machine you got to wait for kernel 5.8 to use the internal microphone and maybe for 5.9 to get accelerometer working, other than that works great
intel belongs in the dust pile along with gamestop and older companies that cannot adapt and will constantly try harder to take everyones money while they themselves do near nothing, the only thing they changed this year is cram more crap in a chip and hope to god you have a cooler good enough to keep it under controll because they cant manage anymore performance so there overclocking chips and calling them next gen aswell as doing false benchmarkings to make it seem like there the better choice when there not.
I love how he change the title

The downside is, that you can’t upgrade the RAM in the 13” model. 8GB is in 2020 not thaat much

Bought a HP Envy x360 15&#39; AMD 4700u , 16 GB &amp; 512GB SSD and I love it! AMD is awesome.
Hey Linus, have you thought about reviewing the ASUS A15 TUF gaming laptop?
my trackpad on my 5 yr old msi 17 inch laptop is smaller than that! lol
That screen aspect ratio on a small laptop is a total deal breaker
Is there not an envyx360 that offers facial recognition? The one I got back in like 2018 had facial recognition
&quot;No caviats recommendation&quot; except for the keyboard ergonomics thing

ok, 16:9? yeah that&#39;s my favorite aspect ratio.
ahhh the segue
Even though amd laptops cpu&#39;s are great. But they don&#39;t come with high end gpu&#39;s. So gaming is not a strong point in any amd laptop. Also hp omen 15 amd apparently has thunderbolt 3 even though the site doesn&#39;t say.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m51s">6:51</a> those hands look fake
It should also be noted that laptops can be had for $50-$200 cheaper for college students depending on where you get them and what kind of sale is going on right now
This is all would be peachy and nice, if those HP envy&#39;s would be available anywhere else in the world (except US). I&#39;m looking to buy max spec 4700U one 13 or 15 model in Europe and still no luck. :(
I am genuinely worried about intel. They need to come up with something big in the next 2 years. Amd are now coming for them with their mobile chips as are apple in both mobile and their desktops and amd already have intel in most desktops. Seriously what are they going to do?
p l e a s e<br><br>STOP complaining about 16:9 <br><br>damn I just want a screen that fits most videos perfectly




Great work AMD.
Im suscribed to this channel for ages now and i have a big smile seeing this video cuz you guys nailed it. That close up camera into de product, the smalls visual jokes in the right amount, that slap in the face with the sincere cons without slowing the pace of the video. The seamless product placement of your own store AND the blatanty obvious segue that break EVERYTHING ahahha<br>It&#39;s just perfect.
Managed to get a lenovo ideapad 5 14 with a 4500u, 16gb of 3200mhz ram, 100%srgb screen, wifi 6, 95w charger(usb c) and a fingerprint reader, all for just 611 euros. Amazing value if you ask me.
Thunderbolt 3 gives one cable solution that regular 10Gb USB cannot compete.
Intel must be forking out decent do$h to manufacturers NOT to use AMD in their top tiers...
Wtf Linus with a beard? Seriusly have i bean gone for that long... i know i bean gone from internet a long time but come on... noo Linus shave asap.
Y&#39;ALL! I BOUGHT THE HP ENVY 360 ON BEST BUY FOR $575. It&#39;s $200 off today.
Intel is better!
Watching on my envy x360 rn

so if Intel dies in 5 years or so and AMD is the only one left will we as consumers suffer from that then due to no competition? Hopefully Intel gets it together and fixes their prices and CPUs but if not would AMD turn into Intel and then we just get the same type of CPUs every year?
Just stay away from hp, poor quality of components, poor thermal performance, rather get dell or lenovo or apple
I&#39;m still happy with my Ryzen 2500U model Envy x360. Too afraid to update the bios though since I&#39;m running Linux.
Me with a Intel Desktop &amp; Laptop: stop. i&#39;ve heard this enough times already. please stop.
AMD really is a hope now..
Why are you comparing past model? Why not go head on the new dell xps 13! Clearly AMD would lose!
Am I the only who seems to think HP named its Intel line after the massive security vulnerability that Intel have, can’t wait for the meltdown review
I wonder which will happen faster, the corona crisis is over or Intel produces something that is actually novel somehow...
Completely unrelated but this is my first LTT video watched on my new LG CX48 OLED as my PC monitor and it looks greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat. His video on the 77&quot; c9 really sold me on OLED-as-a-gaming display. I set up some pretty aggressive sleep mode/screen saver stuff to keep it from getting burned int but I&#39;ll just shut it off when I&#39;m leaving the room for more than 5 minutes. <br>Its nice watching videos in 4k on a display with better than 1000:1 contrast.
Plz if someone at Dell or HP watching this, build an AMD XPS or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> Envy. It will be the best seller.




That&#39;s really interesting, actually. I have the same x360 laptop but older with the 2500U, and it does have full Windows Hello integration. Strange that they removed it on the newer model. Great all around laptop, though.
This dy brand is good
Same model at best buy for $549 :)

WOW. Linus just leaps straight into the vid, no greeting XD
My laptop is amazing for a 450£ laptop amd are doing great
14 horas de duração... AMD fazendo a intel chorar!!! Parabéns, ótimo vídeo Linus, obrigado.
Linus you read my mind. I just order this two days ago. I ordered the 400 nit,  Ryzen 7, 16GB ram config, but with the 128GB SSD so I could upgrade it. Still under $1000
Very good review Linus! Thank you. 👍😁
&quot;Intel isn&#39;t the only option anymore&quot; That&#39;s why Intel is losing now. They got lazy of being always on top.































Suck it intel users, AMD has taken over
HP is trying to STEP UP I see!!!
Can FIFA 20 will run smoothly on envy x360 ?
Someone pls tell me how the speakers sound ????
The HP Envy X360 15.6 inch version with the same specs is currently on sale on Best Buy&#39;s website for $579.
<b>watching this on a Lenovo Flex 14 and gets burned</b> 😿
I would add a mouse and a keyboard.<br>problem solved.<br>for me at least.
Finally we agree with Alex on something that wrist space is too annoying!
No displayport since this isn&#39;t Intel but can you use a type c displayport dock...?
Is intel going to die?
&quot;This is my whole weekend&quot; hahahaha
You know why its called Lenovo Flex?
Who in their right mind uses Cinebench on ultrabook?
Dude... This laptop may push me back to HP after all this years...
Back to school laptop guide 2020?👀
I was thinking about an i5 8300H but this Ryzen 5 makes that obsolete.<br>It took AMD many years to finally make laptop CPU that doesn&#39;t s*ck.
Shame they run windows vs a useable OS
AMD I say it again: U got ONE LAST category left to beat Intel: Gaming. Once Zen 3 beats Intel in Gaming. It&#39;s truly GAME OVER. Server? Check! Laptop? Check! Gaming? NOooooooooo!

They knock the Flex 14 but for $600 you can get a 14&quot; 2-in-1, active pen, ryzen 4500u, 16gb ddr4 3200, and 256gb ssd. Hard to beat that!
I have the same laptop with an original Zen CPU. It’s metal chassis feels and looks high end at first, but actually it is EXTREMELY flimsy. I one grabbed it by a corner and the whole chassis got bent in a way where the clicky track pad stayed depressed, so I had to BEND IT BACK. It also has a touchscreen that supports pen input, bot after a couple of weeks of use the screen started bowing under the weight of my forearm. And finally I accidentally dropped it while it was in its neoprene cover from about half a metre/two feet high and it got irreparably bent. <br>IMO you shouldn’t get this unless HP drastically improved build quality (which I doubt) or you’re EXTREMELY careful with your stuff.
I bought the Lenovo ideapad flex 5 with the ryzen 4500U. Its a fantastic value for $599 and even out preforms the new 10th gen $1800 Macbook Pro.
The voice crack was great
I&#39;ve just gotten this laptop with the ryzen 7 4700u. I&#39;ve noticed that the processor pretty much stays between 1.5 and 2.0GHz when on battery power and doing things like web browsing. When plugging in the laptop however, the processor boosts way higher when doing these things. On the other hand the processor does boost properly when running something like Cinebench R20 when on battery power. My problem is that the laptop is really slow when doing things like web browsing on battery power. Did you experience this behavior as well? Thanks in advance!
What about ASUS - Zenbook 14&quot;  Q4071 or UM433IQ + GeForce MX350 ? That&#39;s even cheaper!
I wouldn’t buy from the sponsor links. Amazon may not come with a warranty since it’s a third party shipped and sold. Newegg and b&amp;h don’t seem to be the same laptop at all.
Why aren&#39;t there any high spec amd laptops
The Lenovo Flex 5 is what I&#39;m going to get anyway. Better specs.
why is there no upgradability section ? can i upgrade the ram ? can i add another ssd ? stuff like this.
My wife bought this exact machine like 1 month ago, and man im impressed everyday with that thing in how well it performs, just yesterday we downloaded Destiny 2 and it managed to run it at 60 fps stable, @ 1080p all low (obviously) but man, being that stable and at that resolution really blew me away
I like how Linus advertised the laptop and LTT store merchandise at the same.
Imagine completing about aspect ratio in a review as one downside for a laptop
thanks for posting this two days after a brought an intel laptop...<br><br>lol jk
HP Pavilion are they any good Linus? I bougth one last year. The spec&#39;s are AMD Ryzen 7  3750H, GTX 1650, 16Gb DDR4, 512Gb ssd. I could not find any reviews on my particular HP model to see if its good or bad 8 months ago.
May be the case in your place... In other places, like Eastern Europe... AMD decent laptops are at a retarded level priced... A ROG Zephyrus G14 that is 1490$ here i ahve to pay for it 2381$ because reasons...
What is it with you guys changing titles?
can we get  a dislike for that background
Me: every time tries to predict the paid promo and LTTstore ad before it appears<br>Linus: goes in a flow and merges it perfectly in the video
Hi Linus can you review a laptop from the list mentioned on this asus studio series laptops there are some insane piece of tech used. The link is pasted below.<br><br><a href="https://www.asus.com/Laptops/StudioBook-Series-Products/">https://www.asus.com/Laptops/StudioBook-Series-Products/</a>
how would this be for editing video? <br>I was planing on buying the Acer Swift 5 with the 8th gen i7, anyone in the comments have advice?
i can tell they recently got a probe lens and now they&#39;re just having as much fun with it as they can
Ogs will remember the original title
The new lens is amazing! Love the shots
I like this Glasswire tech tips.
Now we just need Thunderbolt 3/USB4 on these  for eGPUs
Didn&#39;t see that Segway commin this time you got me.
All of your &quot;CC BY 4.0 links&quot; are broken
to much advertising
I would love it if it had thunderbolt
I had a Acer aspire 3 with ryzen 5 2500u that I got for 400 USD<br>And oh man it sucked <br>The ram and storage was just bull shit

I realy like AMD, went from a FX 9590 to TR 1950X :)<br>But I have to say, I got a RBZ Late19 GTX with this tiny i7-1065G7 Quadcore, and it does over 2000 in CB20 at 3.3 all core all time at around 85°C<br>Just needed to unlock the bios, push TDP to 35W and repaste CPU and GPU.....<br>Thanks Razer :P<br><br><a href="https://www.3dmark.com/spy/12872761">https://www.3dmark.com/spy/12872761</a>
Bruh intel is so obsolete now in literally everything. AMD ftw.
I just bought a Spectre, and am kind of regretting that now.  That Envy looks amazing.
That probe lens shots are sick
Only early people know this video was named &#39;Should you even CONSIDER buying an Intel laptop
I bought a Lenovo Thinkbook 13s for £600 a year ago, 13.3&quot;/i5/8g/256ssd, ram and disk upgradeable, still the best value laptop, come on don&#39;t recommend HP to people
Why I am not able to see the 0.00 USD Sticker pack in the LTT store?Did anybody notice?
i feel that you are using Probe lens, like EVERYWHERE :D Dont get me wrong it makes good clips
Blah blah blah. All I head was much more battery life and pornhub is free.
hehe, my 4700/16/400 nit came in the mail on Friday the 10th. It&#39;s a beast and cost me under $1000. The ONLY downside is that the cool looking finish is a fingerprint magnet.
Stop this fakes plz
The biggest problem is going to be the business side of things for AMD in this regard. thunderbolt and docks are almost a must in big businesses.
Honestly, don&#39;t even buy a laptop...
Beware of the new 15&quot; models of the Envy. I had ordered one with the 4700U - of which the CPU performance was brilliant but HP put in an IPS display with only 45% NTSC and 250 nits of brightness - colours are terrible for content creation and brightness is too low for working outside which unfortunately is very disappointing. So far I have not found a new 15 model with new, AMD processor and decent display. The only one I have found so far with a good display is the one Linus is using in the video (one of the 13&quot; models), with the 300 nits 72% panel which I wish all models had.
20% more performance for 25% less price.. nice
Finally they have started using probe lens
What about overheating issues ???
i dont get it i use 16:9  its damn fine , i mean all 1920x1080 are 16:9 right ? so a gamer is fien wit hit, and so am i because all fansub i watch are 16:9 or 4:3  so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> gives bezzels witch anoy me more
I&#39;m going to have to get a new laptop again soon since when I bought this one I wasn&#39;t paying enough attention to notice that it&#39;s got a crappy intel graphics card built-in.  It&#39;s a good laptop but even the cheapest of steam games require at least a low end Nvidia card lol

A-Anything<br>M-Is<br>D-Better<br>  -Than<br>  -Intel
No Ethernet port no money, Laptops without Ethernet are annoying and can cause a lot of trouble and cost.
Those probe lens shots are really nice;)
these colon commentaries... they are not even funny.
That Probe lens B-roll is soo Dope 🔥
I have always loved AMD, and about half of my computers are AMD-based.  There have been times when it has been hard to find an AMD.  I usually enjoy your videos.  I prefer a nice sponsor plug worked into the video than to have rude mid-roll ads.  My main advice at this point is &quot;lose the chin-hair&quot;.  A mustache might be a subtle nod to your masculinity, but this whole-face macho thing just isn&#39;t working.  Nevertheless, I wish you all the best.
AMD just keeps killing Intel!
That banana b roll lmao
Linus, we need more probe lens shots, and I won&#39;t take no for an answer. ;)
My lenovo ideaflex pad has a 360 degree screen, touchscreen and R5 4500U for only 700 euros, amazing laptop for the price. AMD Ryzen 4000 mobile chips are AMAZING!<br><br>edit:<br>my R5 4500U scored 2232 in Cinabench R20 (multicore) 442 singlecore
I wish I was so smooth at flirting like the way linus is smooth at presenting his sponsors
Blegh.. Alex.. 👎
Something is definitely wrong. No brand has utilitized ryzen 4th gen in their flagship.
Answer to the original title: &quot;No&quot;.
Legion laptops: ANGRY ADVERTISING NOISES







i think another reason that AMD powered laptops aren&#39;t as common in laptops and office pc&#39;s is because well every time i buy an amd product from best buy, there&#39;s a guy in an intel shirt who looks at me weird and attempts to give the message &quot;amd stupid, intel good&quot;
AMD vs. Intel aside, HP Spectre X360 has SO MANY motherboard component issues and recalls that it doesn&#39;t even deserve to be mentioned, AT ALL.
How well will ubuntu run on this? I was thinking about buying an old thinkpad t470, but I might hold out for this. Gawd damn those specs
poor intel...
I still prefer 16:9, especially given that most content is still in that ratio
Was that a pipe lens?
Hey Linus and Co. I&#39;ve had this laptop for just under a week and had countless issues. HP support doesn&#39;t seem interested in doing anything with my unit but I really like the laptop itself.<br>It&#39;s had constant issues going to sleep and it BSOD&#39;s frequently. Plus sometimes it just won&#39;t charge. It&#39;s really annoying because it&#39;s my most expensive laptop ever and it&#39;s the least functioning one I&#39;ve ever had.
Performance is not everything. They are two different laptops.
Dont you think its better to buy the: Lenovo ideapad 5 15&quot; 16GB Ram (soldered in),Rizen 7 4800U with a pretty good integrated graphics card, 512GB SSD for around 680$ (I think). The deal was so good it went out of stock quite fast and you cant buy it until its available again
What about g14?
Are we really anti-16:9 now? Incredibly weird given how strongly people promoted 16:9 over 4:3 15 years ago.
Loved the macro close up shots. You could spend little more time to get them perfect 👌 but it is a great start.
<b>just wait few moments when Apple release their Mac with ARM</b>

Alex, wash your hands. It&#39;s a pandemic.
I’m hoping that seeing more AMD laptops from large manufacturers means that by the time Zen 3 mobile chips release, we will see a good offering of flagship offerings with AMD chipsets instead of mostly only Intel. I mean, just the fact that MSI even has an AMD option shows how Intel’s hold is slipping considering that MSI likely was threatened with losing some under the table payments to prevent AMD competition means that MSI felt they would make more by offering AMD than taking the money from Intel.
There is a caveat: No official linux support. That&#39;s a deal breaker for a growing number of developers and IT workers, as well as becoming common on competitive offerings, particularly dell and lenovo.
We need thinkpads with AMD in it.
review the omen 15 series please?
That banana looked nicely lubed up =)
In all fairness: The Lenovo FLEX 14 does exactly what it promises...
I see you guys got that weirdo super macro lens....
Rocking AMD processor, AMD GPU, AMD stock, AMD shirt, AMD Ryzen sticker on the window of my car 🦾
AMD got so good it is only competing with itself
The only reason i am getting an intel chip is because i have a motherboard already, and r5 3600 plus an am4 would cost me more, but defently if it&#39;s a laptop desktop or a toaster, go amd.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=2m54s">2:54</a> camera guy with his probe lens- &quot;Another one.&quot;


As long as its quad core or more on a laptop u dont need to worry about it. Doesn&#39;t matter if intel or amd. What you should pay attention is the dedicated graphics card and make sure it says nvidia there. No one does rendering or benchmarking on a laptop, at least no one that has a little brain. Battery life 4 hours tops on any laptop if runs on normal or maximum performance power plan. Gaming without charger will limit you to play solitaire or minesweeper if you want to last more than an hour.
☑️ I love this man and this channel so much 😍👏💪👍😘
I loooove my envy I got it at a great price with a ryzen 5. I even paid some more to get more ram and an ssd in. The only thing that I didn&#39;t like was that the power button on it broke recently. I disassembled the laptop and desoldered and resoldered a new replacement button onto the mother board, good as new.




anyone gonna talk about the cool shots throughout the video? v cool  imo
Finally it’s happen i had plan to buy an intel laptop but thanks for that i wait maybe 6 month till we get some other AMD laptops
Intel needs a new architecture. They have to realize that they cant keep beating a dead horse - it just doesnt work. They have squezed it to the absolute max and everything above is just more truble then its worth. The 5 GHz bosots are barely controllable without watter cooling. Gen9 was a joke (especially the BS with i7-i9) and Gen10 are horrable.. I will probably remain on my i7-8700k for a while (its probably the last really good consumer grade CPU Intel made).
I see Brandon is having fun with the probe lens
I heard that CPython+Numpy is much faster on a year-old Intel than a newly-purchased AMD.  I love AMD, have for years, but that makes me wonder about mathematical computing on the recent AMD CPU&#39;s.
I like better this ltt store plug
I have a Envy x360 with a Ryzen 7 from 2017 and it&#39;s still pretty great.
Thought we said the yellow measure stick was out lmao..
Hope they ditched the shitty synaptics drivers
Ryzen mobile 3rd Gen is absolute trash though 😔
I hate the 256GB SSD at least it can be upgraded, I hope the ram isn&#39;t soldered this time. I really needed to upgrade my ram to at least 16GB but no luck.
Are those Dragon Balls? cool
Waiting for DDR5 RAM and Thunderbolt 4 support.
Gotta give credit to Linus for his sheer skills in introducing segue segments in his videos. He is the master. 👏👏👏👏👏
intel: linus please stop<br>linus: amd
is that banana from WAN show?
Hey! Can you review the Lenovo S340 Ryzen 5 version?
the title of this video, and most of it, is all about the CPU<br>but then you talk a lot about the physical aspects of that particular model, as if that goes for all AMD laptops - which of course it does not. Thats kinda weird
Did you try the usb-c charging? There was mixed information on this for last year&#39;s model, but it does work.
What&#39;s a Segway 😆
Is the Surface Pen compatible with it?

WAITING FOR AMD VS APPLE SILICON
Unless you live in the UK and no manufacturers seem to have any 4000 series stock at all, for the last 6 months they&#39;ve been promising them. And I refuse to buy HP after my last 3 died in the first year of their 3 year warranties.
Wanna see Apples new Mac processor vs amd
OKay wtf, phones have longer aspect ratios and laptops hive wider???<br>21:9 Sony 1 ii<br>2:3 New Laptops<br>WTF is going on here

This is the first laptop I&#39;ve actually wanted in a while.
Now we need a Thinkpad with it.<br>Give me The Nub™ or give me death!

Thank you so much, I was just looking for a &quot;budget&quot; laptop with great performance. This video really supported my choice
They are flexing their probe lense hard!! Gotcha 😂💯
What happened to your hair
that hp laptop gives off the most subtle middle finger ever
props to the set designer.

someone is really liking their probe lens uhhh?

I bought this laptop, just different model, 3 weeks ago. I’m glad Linus gave it the thumps up

Yeah amd is making more efficient stuff. these 16 year olds fangirling AMD are getting annoying tho
Why the damn title change?
...and cooler
Great video thank you.  It is great to see AMD making some headway in the laptop market. I do wish we could see some true gaming laptops built and using AMD&#39;s highest performing mobile chips and maybe the best mobile dGPU just to see the best case performance from these Zen 2 mobile chips. So basically would be nice if companies like ASUS,MSI,Gigabyte and any others like Clevo if they still are in business take AMD&#39;s highest mobile CPU SKU and maybe use something like a RTX 2080 mobile if that is the highest on offer now and let it rip through games.<br><br>Edited:<br>I had to laugh at the 16x9 aspect ratio part and how a lot of companies are switching to 16x10. I remember when 16x9 was all of the rage for monitors and 16x10 was marketed as bad and 16x9 was much better. It is good to see most are switching back to 16x10 aspect ratio since it gives you a bit taller screen which is far more useful than 16x9 aspect ratio. Now all we need is for them to get rid of 16x9 on the desktop as well but of coarse that will never happen with everyone in the craze of ultra wide monitors right now. I guess it would be great to see mobile phones take a step back and go from these extremely long screened devices and be made with wider screens as well but again that won&#39;t happen until the long thin screen craze dies out.

Plot twist: thats not linus🤣
The quality of  B roll in the video is just awesome. must be the probe lens.
Actually Acer has a same spec&#39;d comp like the HP one for $512


























What an irony. Phone displays have got longer and longer and thus YouTube videos lost height to make up for taller displays held horizontally and now we want more squared PC screens....
Im getting this with the ryzen 7
I would like to see more $ to $ comparisons. (apples to apples) A fair comparison. (250$ difference is a lot)<br>Either way, having something cheaper outperform the expensive thing is kinda better of a comparison.<br>Because it shows the truth. Just because it&#39;s more expensive doesn&#39;t imply that it&#39;s better.<br>Nice vid as always ;)
I&#39;m getting a feeling Intel is pulling one on us...
Hello  Linus please do a pc build for AI and machine learning .please please<br>If others also want it please request linus  in comments or make this comment most liked in comments section so they will notice it.
The cinematography in this video is really good, keep it up!
Wtf why is this laptop (G14), designed in Taiwan, built in China, here in Germany about 650$ more expensive than in the US????
This video makes me happy. Finally some good ol&#39; competition
Yeah wtf HP (and Dell too actually). Just give us AMD on the top series. I want an XPS with Ryzen.
I like living in this era fellas...
These kinds of comparisons are normal for now, but the actual competitor for Renoir from Intel is not Ice lake, but tigerlake, so 1135G7. That will trump all over 4500U.
There isnt a sector on the planet where AMD does not have compute density over Intel. Its literally every aspect of computing.
Why is he calling a $1000 laptop cheap? I thought my $500 laptop was a budget option to most people
Not to mention AMD has a Ryzen 9 3950X laptop, whereas intel doesn&#39;t have anything remotely close to that kind of horsepower in a laptop.
Not accounting for the fact that the intel models have already undergone months of battery degradation and cycles of charge while the amd one is almost brand new?
I had a Lenovo with an i5-6200u for work and it was terrible. I have a new Lenovo now and it has an  8 core Ryzen 4700u. The only things I don&#39;t like is the 4GB DDR4 soldered on board and lack of wired ethernet. However, none of those are faults of the Ryzen CPU. Paid $800 for the laptop + upgrades and am very happy with it despite the lack of SMT. It&#39;s way better than anything I could have gotten with an Intel model. <br>5/5 on value, cinebench 20 score of 2701
are you even really Linus 🤔
AMD :64cores 25thraeds<br>Intel  :2core .......5000000threads<br>Apple silicon:.. ... ....... . ..   ... .   . <br>😂😂😂😂😂😂
I&#39;m still quite happy with my MSI GL65 9SDK-039 (i7 9750H, GTX 1660 Ti, 32GB DDR4, 1TB NVMe, 15.6&quot; 1920x1080 120Hz IPS) which you can get for 1200 USD, although I do use a Ryzen 7 2700x in my desktop though!
BUT AT THE BRINK OF DEATH INTEL WILL NEVER LEARN..  THEY ALWAYS WILL BE ANTI CONSUMER, ANTI COMPETITIVE , MONEY GREEDY BASTARDS!
Make a video of you gaming in the wood with a full set up
I find most laptops unnesacerry(i dont know how to write it) they are expensive. Bad batterie. Screen sucks. Etc. I prefer building a pc. And buying a tablet. (Im talking about the perpecstive of someone who doent have 1000 dollars for a good laptop
Those macro shots 👍🏻
I kinda hate I purchased intel i5 10th gen in lenovo c640 with the same price point 6 months ago. But whatever, use what you have.
I kinda wish that there was another channel for this type of video, most people I would bet watch the budget tech reviews for the high production value and Linus. However I much prefer the high end crazy water cooling stuff. But still great video
An Intel powered laptop called Spectre... what&#39;s the higher spec one called, Meltdown?? &gt;.&gt;
Imagine getting this in India for $800..
hey @Linus  !!!<br>can we use a laptop Power Charger Adapter on pc??
Still no good AMD business convertibles. I will NEVER again buy another consumer laptop, just for the durability and longlivity alone.<br><br>And Thunderbolt...
I&#39;m curious why you chose those two models for the comparison. HP offers the same laptop with both options, AMD/Intel, that you could&#39;ve compared. They are 15 inch models so maybe that but the 15M-EE0013DX and 15M-ED0013DX are the same laptops just one uses the 4500U and the other i5-1035G1 respectively. Plus the 15 inch model is cheaper at 779 for the AMD powered laptop and 849 for Intel. Both available at Best Buy.
I love the new set!!!
that&#39;s why I plug in my Logitech G15 YUG75 keyboard and Azio GM 2400 to whatever laptop I&#39;m using.
NOW i&#39;ll said to Bye-Bye Intel we must end :&#39;(
Talk about timing, I just swapped from an Intel laptop to an AMD one like a day and a half ago. It&#39;s almost like Linus knows what&#39;s up.
HP have terrible customer service or post buying experience and you did not mention if they are overheating or not. Spectre laptops usually do.
I have the older Envy x360 with a Ryzen 2500U and its great to see they&#39;ve managed to make it even better. But its odd that the new one doesn&#39;t have Windows Hello, because mine does. And it cost almost the same price.
THIS IS FAKE LINUS!!!

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m00s">6:00</a><br>MY EYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Unfortunately, still no thunderbolt, which is absolutely essential for me. Too bad.
Good Script Alex !
Intel is shaking.
I will never buy an HP piece of dog shit.  Their software wouldnt install completely no matter what I did, the screen on their laptop died, and the replacement screen died too.  HP owns Compaq, and years ago I had many problems with my Compaq Desktop PC.....soooooo, for me, Ill never give HP another dollar.
Neat, so the SSD with recommended storage sizes (256gb) has room for 2 games at a time lol
This guy makes me want to buy a laptop now even though I already have 2
REVIW THE NEW LENOVO FLEX 5 14. It&#39;s got 16gb ram, ryzen 5 4500u and 256GB with a STYLUS. FOR 599$.
Intel thinks they will still be able to threaten oems not to make good premium-quality ryzen laptops, but that time is quickly drawing to a close. I guess they will just have to make better products now if they want to be sold, like every other company. Awwww how sad! Bye bye Intel, you should have innovated your tech instead of your criminal corporate milking schemes
6:19 am I the only one who wants a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> desktop screen (that can also handle gaming)? I just love that aspect ratio because video editing is really nice on it.

For the work place, I&#39;ve always found AMD to be a better value for money.
Lenovo flex 5 is a laptop I really want to see on a LTT
Thems macro shots with Brandons new tasty macro lense are tasty. GG Brandon.
I recently bought a Lenovo Thinkpad E595 with Ryzen 5 3500U, 8GB RAM (upgraded to 16GB immediately for dual channel), 512GB M.2 NVMe SSD with no preinstalled OS and 1080p IPS display for less than 500€ directly from Lenovo. That thing took the meaning of value to another level.
Great review! thanks! What about the 15&quot; version?<br>Please review more AMD Ryzen 4000 laptops!<br>What do you guys think of the Legion 5 ? IdeaPad 5 15 ?
I have 2018 version, and very happy with it
I can&#39;t stress how much I like Linus&#39;s new look over the gel filled ones he used to have. <br><br>The beard is just awesome.
Anyone else guilty of skipping the sponsor ad and then listening to the intro in full. Like literally rewinding just to make sure you get *the whole thing*.
A Segway is a personal transportation device that goes off a cliff and kills its inventor, but that&#39;s not important right now...
THATS THE SMOOTHEST SEGWAY EVER
Got mine at Costco for $600 with a 500 gig ssd. Can&#39;t beat it
HP as a cheap option just killed its competition picking AMD...
Hey Linus, how about a video about customer support? I love beast hardware as much as the next person, but I&#39;d never buy an HP because of their terrible customer support.
I love my probook 645 g4 😍 ryzen ❤
fuck im blasted, linus is always hilarious
Give it to me
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=5m43s">5:43</a> USB-A is 🤮 now.
Days when an intel laptop with 4 cores were 1200 dollars <br>:- &quot;How can it be his cheap&quot;<br>Now an 6 core for 800 <br>:-&quot;Is this a joke&quot;
The Envy series is awesome. They don&#39;t call it envy for nothing, but I have the 2019 12GB 1, 035 dollar model from Best Buy. It a awesome laptop.
Hey so spinning the hp 360 on those colorful balls was awesome

Orginal Title: Should You Even Consider Buying A Intel Laptop
idk 13 inch sceen just doesnt make sense for me, for a tablet that you hold in your hands would be huge and for a laptop that you set on a table and rock back its minuscule
Where can I get that swirly wallpaper??
Intel lineup is envying the AMD lineup now...
The real winner of this video is the high quality B-roll
Short Answer... No
Always undervolt your laptop !!!
I bought an HP envy about 2 years ago since I needed a mobile device that can handle soldiworks... I gotta say, I love my Envy, but I&#39;m embarrassed that it has an Intel chip... The new ones with the AMD chips are so much faster and cheaper than mine...

I really wish I could get an AMD based laptop but there issue with real time audio and the compatibility/stability issues of there USB controller with audio interfaces and midi devices.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=8m22s">8:22</a> is it a Probe lens shot?!
why all the title switching? are you hoping the people who click the first title wil think its a new vid and click it again? i dont get it, stop doing that please, your titles are TERRIBLE 90% of the time, and youre not fixing them, you have techquickies without the topic theyre about as title, wtf?
Im Watching This On A Ryzen 7 3700U 16GB RAM HP Envy x360
Thanks a lot. It&#39;s now out of stock bc of this vid. It was the computer I was going to get for college.
Hp service is still bad. :/
Poor Intel.
HP - Huge Problems
When I saw you on PulseWay  I was like &quot;How did Linus change so much in 2 days&quot; 😂<br>Then realised it was an ad 😏

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m19s">4:19</a> cool, free stickers
If that bish had a thunderbolt port I’d be all over it. Went with a Razer bc I specifically need an egpu for my workflow
you need to go in to more detail on the screen , what is the RGB that info is impotent.
I like the inclusion of the typing comfort chart, please keep including it in laptop reviews.
&quot;Sponsored by AMD&quot;.....
This or a 5700xt and a ryzen 5 3600?
Love the B roll and transitions
whats more interesting is how much of a pain this will be for apple&#39;s ARM transition, we all expected that to show intel a lesson or two be being at least as fast while lasting twice as long, but now they will be facing off against zen3 laptops next year<br><br>they are definitely too far into it to back off now and they would&#39;ve still gone ahead anyway even if AMD had offered this 3 years before, just not this soon, now the reviews wont shut up about their ARM macs mediocre performance and compatibility issues vs AMD, whereas facing off with intel would&#39;ve been mostly a clear win against that skylake&#39;s 39th refresh on that chunky dell/hp
Strange how all the superior mobile AMD chips are ending up in lower tier notebooks...
Who Noticed the Title Changed
AMD，YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS
nice B-roll on the keyboard shots!
Start clicking left arrow key directly at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m00s">0:00</a>. Linus goes YEEYEEYEEYEEYEE.<br>I know, stupid but hilarious
This has come at a very welcome time as my girlfriend&#39;s daughter will need a laptop for school soon and something like this will tick pretty much all (maybe even all) of the boxes.
I love the macro b-roll.
YES MORE LAPTOP REVIEWS PLS
Lol, Im watching this on my HP Envy that just came in through the mail an hour ago. Was waiting for Linus&#39;s review on it but didn&#39;t want to miss the 4th of July sale!<br><br>Great laptop that&#39;s for sure!

@<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m19s">4:19</a> I’ll take my free stickers, see they probably saw it in post and took them off the website


But I&#39;ve heard that AMD processor systems have software incompatibility issues and AMD systems can&#39;t ever get thunderbolt 3, it&#39;s an Intel technology. Linus, do confirm.
Loving the Dad Beard
Stop kicking him AMD ..he is dead already
I&#39;m waiting for LG gram to adopt Ryzen.
TD for including a Funko pop in the video
very clever segue
Will you actually debate the subject of why AMD are beating Intel? Intel got backdoored in the Intel factory in Israel and they wotk with China. That&#39;s why Intel are pouring 5bn into their US factories to fix the mess.
I would appreciate it if LTT would do a review on MONO head sets with microphone. . Many older users are deft in 1 ear  [like myself] . For me Wired is fine , but I am curious about wireless sets. Thank You.
nice transition to hp logo
Yes but what games work? ShipBreaker?
AAAH The good ol put an Astera Titan in the frame game. I see you, production nerds. I see you.
Haha have you annoyed Intel by any chance?
Now if only we could get an AMD laptop with at least an RTX 2070 inside too ...














I suppose I have tunnel vision; wasn&#39;t aware anyone but AMD made processors.
Get the envy x360 or the asus vivobook flip 14 with the same and processors?
<b>someone give Linus the Asus TUF A15</b>
AMD just seems to be crushing Intel lately. Like it will be amazing if Intel ever makes a comeback.
I don&#39;t edit video or anything crazy on my computers. I use the iTunes and music and just simple applications on my computers. I have no problem owning and AMD computer. My Linux computer has a Ryzon 7 and is probably overkill for the operating system. I like the lower price with the performance I want.
Hey guys I&#39;ve always wondered if it was somehow possible to run light vr applications on the most recent APUs, (desktop or laptop). Would anyone have an idea if it&#39;s possible? Talking Gravity Sketch or some similar VR app.

How can I check CAS Latency of RAM using cmd in windows ?
How good is the pen support for this laptop? I&#39;m thinking about using something like this for note taking for work
Goddamn, I love the hardware in the envy laptops, but there are 2 deal breakers:<br>) I have huge hands, so the keyboard does not do the job (have tried prior generations of the envy lineupl<br>) thunderbolt or USB 4 (I need solid docking capabilities)
New macro shots are great, keep it going. I think you got that probe lens marques mentioned.
You guys gotta blow off keyboards with some compressed air if you’re going to be getting that close. There were skin crumbs in some of the laptop crevasses 🤢
I must give like for the shameless plug of <a href="http://lttstore.com/">lttstore.com</a>
Question, while i see this channel comparing a lot of the thin and light, why is it mostly consumer line product? I mean, I remember Lenovo got their mention of thinkpad x1, but what about HP&#39;s elitebook series, Dell latitude etc?  ya know, for the work from home business pros.. just a thought
The segway was cool in this one..
ayy first
Dell’s Inspiron series has some great 14 inch ryzen 4000 series options that are cheaper than this. My only complaint is the awful bronze color.
Bought the 1tb ssd configuration just 2 days ago at 900€ (taxes....). Its value-for-money is just incredible. I&#39;m a university student, and this is just the perfect device for me. I can use it with the pen to take notes in classes on Onenote, while still being able to play some games (its integrated graphics performs pretty much the same as the mx150 on my old laptop). Mind-blowing battery life, pen support, excellent performance, gaming capable, extremely thin and light, good screen (I don&#39;t care about 16:9), and very good trackpad and keyboard (i&#39;ve got tiny hands). I love those usb-a ports, I wonder why other brands don&#39;t do the same. This is absolutely the best device a student can buy, there&#39;s nothing better (actually there are other options but waaaay over 1500$).
I think the reason these chips are only in limited models is probably due to manufacturers still have a ton of intel Mobil chips stockpiled. Perhaps the intel supply is even lasting longer with the economy slowing. Once the more expensive intel stockpile is used up, we will see many more of these better amd chips.
Now I regret so much buying the surface pro
Those close up shots are just so sweat. They really let you feel like you are using Ansel, zooming in on interesting objects to check out the amount of realism xD

Hp envy x360 Ryzen or Dell Inspiron 7405 Ryzen, which one to go ????
hey, i have a pc and my keyboard and mouse isnt working. any idea how i can fix it?
@linustechtips hey I’ve been watching you for abt 3 month now learning abt PCs I’m trying to build myself one and I have $350 my goal is to get to $1000
Every new ultrabook in 2020 should be coming out with AMD period. If I were in the market right now, I would not even consider an Intel based ultrabook.
I mean it only makes sense that AMD is better

i&#39;ve recently upgraded to an AMD cored laptop from an Intel Celeron cored laptop, was so impressed, the desktop got upgraded to a ryzen too
I need this on the elitebook series. Better io and upgradeability
I&#39;m actually in the market for a new laptop so this video came at just the right time. Thanks Mr. Tech Tips
If you do the ball spin thing again, you should use solids of constant width(see Maker&#39;s Muse for more info)

I&#39;d be interested to see how this thing holds up over time.  My organization got about 200 HP G7 laptops a year ago and they had some super cheap, unreliable SSDs.  On top of the M2 SSDs that crapped out within a couple months (low percentage of them, but they certainly add up), the devices had a 2.5&quot; bay with no SATA port, so we had to use M.2 to replace them.
Original title: should you even consider buying a Intel laptop
Awesome screen, awesome camera, long lasting battery life
The availability really sucked though for the 4000 series in any laptop with some graphics horsepower, had to opt for a gs66 in the end as it was the only somewhat portable laptop with good specs to get and the high refresh rate did it for me, meanwhile on the amd side the best i could&#39;ve done there was the 120hz display on the g14 which i heard has some ghosting issues.
Is Linus filming from IKEA today
Seriously the only thing that it is missing is thunderbolt. Imagine using it on the go all day and come home and game.
Hey guys, I recently sold my mac book Pro as I need a Windows laptop for my computer science class. I sold it for for £400 and I was just wondering if anyone had any laptop suggestions within that price range. I&#39;m just looking for something that can do some programming and run light games on low settings (games like csgo or overwatch)
I wonder for how much longer Intel&#39;s MDF (bribery) will keep manufacturers from offering their consumers decent laptops
cringe
The B-Roll in this vid is gorgeous
Did I get this right? Lower price and higher performance than XPS 13?
The only thing that prevents me from buying a laptop from AMD is the lack of Thunderbolt 3. I know it&#39;s only intel&#39;s stuff but for some people like me, a laptop is enough and the Thunderbolt 3 gives a certain versatility that my laptop needs
16:9 displays are perfect. Don&#39;t fix what isn&#39;t broken.
Someone got that Laowa Probe lens, and that someone is very happy using it ;)
Hello guys, I am here for help. I am trying to build a PC. It will have:<br>GPU: 1660 Ti<br>CPU: Ryzen 5 3600<br>Motherboard: Asus B450- the gaming version<br>Ram: Hyperx 2x8 GB 3200mhz RAM<br>Power supply: be quiet! 650w 80+gold<br>1 TB 7200rpm HDD<br>500GB nvme m.2 SSD<br>Will it run games like COD on higher settings at higher FPS?<br>My budget is 1000€, which is like 1,100$

Where is that 0$ sticker pack on the ltt store?
One question to whom<br> might be able to help: I have the previous model of envy, with 3500u. It&#39;s still an exceptional laptop for the price I got it, but I am irritated by the glaring screen. Any hints on how to solve this?
It&#39;s amazing how LTT keeps improving the quality on their videos
Apple: ditches intel for faster, longer battery, and cheaper processors.<br>AMD: Am I a joke to you?

This video looks better than usual...
Intel on life support
Wow my Acer Nitro 5 with a Ryzen 4600H; was a steal in fact... So happy to have it.
Thermals at 4500U is WAY WORSE than 3500U. I know, it&#39;s 6 cores and it&#39;s a higher wattage config. But still, that&#39;s a fact. Using a similar HP laptop from last year.
As someone who just bought this exact laptop (except with a larger SSD) slightly over a month ago, I can whole heartedly agree with basically everything in this review. It is easily the most high-end laptop I have ever owned and it shows in build quality and just overall niceness of the machine. I have a few slight issues though, one of them is the lack of ethernet, even with the USB-C hub HP sells you as an optional extra (which has hdmi, 2x USB-A and USB-C) also switching between laptop and tablet modes closes the application I am using for some reason (usually youtube or netflix through a browser) although that is more likely to be a windows thing than an hp thing, and I have since gotten used to tablet mode enough to get my videos back on the screen within 2 seconds.<br>Another slight issue I have is that it doesn&#39;t recognise my handwriting very well, although my handwriting is also terrible, so that might not be relevant for anyone else.<br>One thing that puzzles me about this review though is why you decided to compare the CPU to that in the Spectre and then made the &quot;$200 more expensive machine&quot; argument, if that same CPU is also an option in the envy for the same price as this ryzen model, in fact for €50 more (I am using the Dutch website to compare prices) you have an I7. (Still, it is hard to argue for intel even at the same price, it&#39;s just weird that you added that $200 difference as a mark in favour of the AMD laptop.)<br>Also you CAN charge it through type C, it just gives you a message that it recommends you use the original charger that came in the box every time you do so.
What&#39;s with all these 8GB memory laptops?
Where is my compile benchmark? :&#39;(
Can you make a review about the 15in version of this laptop ? The 15in version is going for 600 dollars at bestbuy rn
This channel has devolved to just product reviews and talking about intel vs AMD lately, aside from the occasional stray decent video.  Bring back the fun content like pizza warming PC
No wonder Intel is jealous, the AMD laptop&#39;s name is Envy
Linus their must be compatition,  otherwise INTEL is gonna skyrocket the price of thier chips. And AMD is kill it.
oh that add was smooooth ;3
great macro shots :)
It&#39;s a great laptop but just like the Flex 5, it&#39;s disappointing it only has 8 gigs of memory.
Got mine at Costco with $200 off bringing it to $599, even better bang for a buck
Well pretty sure I’m gonna choose A.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................pple Silicon
Is it HP or DQ on the back? I mean, I wouldn&#39;t complain if I got some coupons for Dairy Queen with my laptop, but...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m28s">0:28</a> I like that :D
I prefer 16:9.
Bought the 15&quot; 4500u 16GB Version for 820€ including tax - its a killer maschine for this priocepoint - love it
Why does LTT change their titles so often? It seems as if they do it on 75% of their videos at this point.
Ok, at this point this is already necrophilia
I like 16:9
Yeay, affordable ultra book
How in the holy fuck is anyone surprised that amd is cheaper and better than Intel? You all act surprised in every video Linus makes and it’s been like this since ryzens appeared lmao
Oh goodie. Another clickbait video title that gets changed after a while.<br>This is such a bad look for Y&#39;all.
Brandon&#39;s really having fun with a probe lens...
You got scammed I payed $750 for the same configuration (Lenovo), but with a 512 gb ssd and a ryzen 7 4700u

6 cores, 6 threads? Was that a mistake in what was said?
Let us not forget the almighty Thinkpad!
I m really waiting for the future surface laptop with ryzen 4000
Finally, acknowledging Renoir-U&#39;s <b>vastly</b> superior efficiency to the lakes means it wins in single core as well. Can&#39;t boost to that theoretical clock ceiling when you&#39;re power and thermal contrained.
Please please PLEASE review the IdeaPad slim 7 with Ryzen 4000!! On paper, it&#39;s more of a premium ultrabook than the envy x360!
Smoothest segway yet smh
For someone who doesn&#39;t do much typing or use a trackpad, the aspect ratio is a non issue.
<b>Go home Intel ! Your&#39;e drunk !</b>
yeah ok, but Linus JUST HOW MUCH does amd keep paying you .. enough with this fan boy stuff man. . I mean, I&#39;m using an amd chip and loving it dearly and all that but jeez man your style is getting kinda irritating about this boo intel - woo amd stuff.. tone it down a notch will you ....
I got my mom the R5 2500U 15 inch version a few years ago and it was already a very pleasant device with its 1st gen Zen quad core CPU. With 6 cores it&#39;ll be even better and probably better battery life. This is a great laptop for people that want a good keyboard and touchscreen for a reasonable price. Though hers has a full keyboard.
Look at that, there is the probe lens. Awesome shots!
Wrist resting is bad form for typing ergonomics. More people typing than ever, none of them know how to type.
<a href="https://youtu.be/CyT4lkBIga4">https://youtu.be/CyT4lkBIga4</a>
I really hope 2021 is the year AMD processors get in literally all laptops available. Why the hell would we want anything Intel right now.
The 15.6” from Costco has a keyboard that is more roomy.
Top question: is he real Linus?
so many probe shots hahaha
FINALLY, THANK YOU ALEX FRICK THAT ABSOLUTELY BRAINDEAD SIDEBAR THAT THROWS OFF A PERFECT CENTRED KEYBOARD. FINALLY. ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
I&#39;m waiting for Ryzen 4000 gamings laptops...
Wanna hear really sad story? Corporate buyers do not care and they are gonna be buying Intel &#39;coz of they always have - no matter what. Personal experience.
Also this is the only laptop that I know of, that you can open the screen with one hand like Apple&#39;s MacBooks. It&#39;s an underrated feature imo
Can we get some basic gaming benchmarks for the Ryzen 4xxxU chips in various laptops/ultrabooks? Would love to know just how well these perform with real world thermals, on/off battery, and more.
I&#39;m supprised Linus didn&#39;t drop the sponsor <a href="http://drop.com/">Drop.com</a>

In my country this thing costs 1000 usd but the wages are about a third of the us wages. Gj hungary
Kind of surprised Apple didn&#39;t switch to AMD chips for that extra performance and battery life. These are impressive<br><br>Unless comparing their new &#39;mobile&#39; chips to Intel&#39;s garbage ones makes them look better (it does!)
Hopefully these are better all-around than the 2019 versions. I have the Envy 15 x360 Ryzen5 3500. While the performance is great, I&#39;ve had more issues with things like the keyboard/trackpad becoming completely unrepsonsive until reboot in a few months than I did in 4yrs with my XPS15 before it.
AMD is great, but HP...<br><b>overheating jumbo turbines of doom flashbacks</b><br>I don&#39;t know man, seems kinda hand roasting to me
Who noticed the probe lense used in both the videos!!!!
Where is promised G7 review 😠
A lot of manufacturers didn&#39;t quite know what to expect from the Zen 2 version of AMD mobile chips and even some people were a bit on the fence during CES since before Ryzen 4000, AMD couldn&#39;t really compete with Intel on mobile. This means that a lot of manufacturers were kind of late to adopt Ryzen 4000, which will not be the case for mobile Zen 3, so it will be interesting to see how many more laptops will feat Ryzen 5000 mobile.
Well the screen of the amd is lower .  Intel still have a better screen .<br>And that is something I use more than what some more gpu or cpu power. <br>Still looking for a amd laptops with a good screen .
Now we just need thunderbolt 3 on AMD laptops for high end laptops like the Razer Blade to use it.
Friendly reminder: Buy your laptop before Linus talks about it and the price goes up.
And remember guys, this is not even close to amd&#39;s highest end U series cpu&#39;s. Still the 4700 and 4800u on top of that...  Imagine a laptop with 60% more performance on cpu, and around 20% more performance on gpu...
I gotta be honest, my experience with HP has always been shit.<br>Their stuff is typically flimsy and the HP drivers are horsepiss =( I&#39;m weighing up this device rn, maybe it&#39;ll be better the.... nth time round LOL
3:2 what the fuck? We gameboy advance now bois
Yes but Envy got issue with temp
WAN show Linus: Oh, no we used a banana as a size comparison in an old video!<br>Linus Tech Tip: Throw a banana at it.
That’s the exact laptop I’m looking at getting, with the ryzen 7, but I hadn’t seen any good videos with the new ryzen 7 cpu, but man even the ryzen 5 looks good too.
Wow. What a sweet looking machine. IO is definitely not impressive if there is no HDMI output.
Commenting on Linus videos till they send me a pc day #77
With 16Gb ram I&#39;d buy it straight away
Spoiler alert: Lenovo flex is only $599 with more ram, larger SSD, and the same processor. Plus, it&#39;s Touchscreen with a pen.
GG intel you will be missed lol

I love how people here are commenting that they&#39;ve been recommending AMD since the longest time, whereas less than 3 years ago, these same people would have thrashed AMD and hailed Intel!😂


I made a deal with my dad so i could get a pc. It will have a Ryzen 5 2600 a gigabyte b450 DS3H, 16gb ram 3200mhz, a gtx 1650 and a 240gb ssd and 580gb hdd

Damn... Lenovo Flex really does flex lol
What is better? The ryzen 5 or the i5 10gen
Amd STOP they are already dead
those close up macro shots are awesome ... sometimes catch myself going back to kamino video for more ...
Is the SSD replaceable btw??
Linus can you do a laptop test for audio production ! , keep up the great work !
Damn, i wish amd was that good 2years ago when i was looking for an ultrabook, i was looking at the first versions of this laptop that apparently had some issues
I had a customer bring a Laptop sporting a &quot;Ryzen&quot; sticker on the outside and I thought:  &quot;This should clean-up nice&quot;, but it was a crap older dual-core chip that was actually really slow (too slow, and under GPU-powered, to even launch a Linux Mint Live Disc) and the customer&#39;s husband bought it last Christmas.  AMD needs to control branding of high-end vs low-end a LOT better.  Intel, for all their faults, was very smart to go with the i3, i5, i7 thing - to spell out the grade of processor you were buying.
but not of a price difference
Wait wtf I have that exact Envy laptop!!<br><br>Edit: Oh wait nvm, is not the exact same. I have another version of the presented Envy x360. <br>It&#39;s been a good laptop for me. Really fast. My only complaint is the trackpad. But other than that it is great!
Those glasswork sponsors get weirder everyday😂
Sometimes Linus annoys me. This time, i love him. Yey for HP!
That laptop ball spin is very nice!

I have the Envy with the AMD. I love the design, but I&#39;m having issues. It won&#39;t wake from sleep and it auto rotates and locks in portrait when I close it. Is anyone else having problems like this? Have tried all Windows and HP updates.
Man i love the fact that you have gotten a macro lens and started using it in these creative ways in your latest videos. is it the Laowa probe lens that you are using?
Flexing that probe lens muscle.... Looks crisp. Love it. Especially the shot with the fingerprint sentence. Nailed it.
What universe are you even living in..? I&#39;ve been looking for a new laptop for almost a month, and I had 0 worthy AMD options...
That HP logo is really slick
Linus ! . Xiaomi notebook 16 ryzen edition ?
Is that Linus
No. Not the intro.
Can we appreciate the use of the Laowa 24mm macro lens in the latest LTT videos?
But Can it run Crysis?
Thank you for the sudden r/bananaforscale
yeah beat intel , I hate intel policy
Yes, but bro it&#39;s a HP. Packard Bell before them was the most unreliable PC company around, and HP has carried that torch thereafter. I&#39;d be willing to bet this laptop will come with tons of bloatware and the cheapest hardware that satisfies the specs. Thank you for the video, I ❤️ LTT.
Banana!!!
I freaking love how cheaper laptops are getting a review cause tbh it helps me so much when it comes to making a future purchase 😅😘
How well does the laptop support Linux yet? I&#39;d love this to become a category in reviews…
Am I the only one that likes 16:9 Its good for multitasking.
Also, no thunderbolt 3 yet so...

We already switched to Ryzen for our company laptops with AMDs last generation processor. And now it’s getting even better.
I remember when Intel launched the 8250U 3 years ago, and everyone praised it for finally offering something more powerful than a dual core after all that time. Now 3 years later we have machines that offer double the cores, are faster, have better battery life and are cheaper than the i5 Inspiron I got back then. What a time to be alive.

It seems like Sebastian is doin ads on Glasswire Video
I was just browsing this laptop on Costco, the R7+512gb variant, and cheaper, and 4 yr warranty. it gets ridiculously difficult to resist. I am struggling to resist right now...
Can you review Gaming Laptops?
Honestly not sure I could get myself to accept anything without dedicated graphics (and I don&#39;t necessarily need or care about ultralight/thin-n-light). I had to borrow my mom&#39;s laptop for a week on vacation (my old laptop is not travel friendly anymore, and a new laptop hasn&#39;t been a priority since the coof came around) and Vega 8 graphics wasn&#39;t enough to run Fallout 76 on 720 low at more than 25 fps. It&#39;s not my laptop so I didn&#39;t want to dive too deep into tuning it to get maybe an extra 5 FPS because it was running a 2500U and I had better things to do on vacation and wanted to just play in my downtime.
I’m buying a laptop for the screen quality and GPU. CPU performance is about the last thing I care about so long as it’s good for gaming
Looks like someone really likes his macro lens
Intel: &quot;Dead Inside&quot;<br>HP: You ENVY Bro?


Hi Alex. Surface Laptop Gang here! Alcantara, Intel WIFI Chip (Reliable af), and the best keyboard ever.
A 16x10 display would&#39;ve hit it out of the park probably.
Ryzen 4000 series in budget laptops are the way to go in 2021
Have you guys checked the AMD version of the Acer Swift 3? It has a Ryzen 7 4700U and it costs $650!
What is it with you guys and 13&quot; laptops? Most people want 15&quot; or 17&quot;. Any chances of you reviewing some models in that size rangw?
Would you be able to review the 15.6 Envy x360 also?  It&#39;s the only one that shows up at Best Buy &amp; I was considering it myself.
I love AMDs CPUs but I should say that the price comparison isn&#39;t really fair since they&#39;re different lines.
That&#39;s my laptop 😊<br>The new HPEnvyX360, I got it with the Ryzen 7 4700U &amp; 16G of RAM, and I can tell it&#39;s a Beast 🤯<br>And believe me when I say so, as I work as an Embedded Linux Engineer, and I build Linux Systems for living 😅 so I use all the power I have 24/7 🤷🏻‍♂️<br>This little Ultrabook really shines 🤩<br>Check those benchmark results:<br><a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/2744936">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/2744936</a><br><a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/1076758">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/1076758</a><br><a href="https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/29759878">https://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/29759878</a><br><a href="https://valid.x86.fr/e2a8zl">https://valid.x86.fr/e2a8zl</a><br>So it&#39;s faster than the fastest score for the Macbook Pro 13&quot; with Intel i7 (double the price) :D<br><a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/2903615?baseline=2744936">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/2903615?baseline=2744936</a><br>And of course it&#39;s much much faster than the XPS 13&quot; with i7-1065g7<br><a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/2903044?baseline=2744936">https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/compare/2903044?baseline=2744936</a><br>So yeah RIP Intel!


AMD really needs to figure out how to get into the XPS and Thinkpad Carbon X1 lineups. The screen on this laptop is pretty good, but it&#39;s really sad to see the absolutely gorgeous displays only available on Intel based laptops.
Thanks AMD
Me:- I&#39;m not going to betray intel....<br>Also me:- AMD is the new love
Why is 16:9 a problem??
Would be nice to also see reviews of the 15&quot; line. Those do a lot better for typing IMO with the full keyboard
Ok wow that has to be his worst segway ever.
they cripple amd on purpose with bad cooling solutions &quot;dell&quot; &quot;asus&quot; and intel pays $$$ so no oem builds amd laptops with highend graphics cards.
Lol you can get the ryzen 5 config for 600£ no need to go for the 800$ hp option. Get the vivobook 15 or the huawei matebook d15 2020
Hey, what do you think about arm laptops? Are you interested in them( if the software support get up to intel) . To be honest I really want to see the battery life in those laptops
The cinematography for this video is insane
that new macro lens is pretty nice
I see you guys got a new lens there 👀
where is my obligatory iphone 4 size comparison
Why is this video hosted by Linus instead of Alex?
Lol my current laptop runs faster than the Intel laptop that Linus is using in this video😂
Deez nuts
Okay, I was waiting for this review, and was not expecting Linus to absolutely recommended the HP Envy x360.
Brandon is having a good time using that macro probe lens XD
The whole Intel Inside thing will be very soon a thing of the past, if its not already LOL. <br>Those new CPU&#39;s from AMD are really hot, and not just cuz they are coming in a red/orange boxes (altho red makes everything faster right)
Intel is like apple when it comes to processor. That&#39;s why they still dominate the CPU market. And i don&#39;t think ARM processors are the future of computer anyhow.
bye bye intel
Linus doing good use of those probe lens
Does the amd laptop get hot or warm underneath.
Omg that segway almost made me die.
Man, now I wonder whether I should ditch my r5-2500u Envy x360 for the new one. Battery life on the 2018 model is fairly poor (4 - 5 hours). That&#39;s about as long as my work laptop (XPS 15 w/ the 4K OLED).
i love AMD ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Stickers for free?
Where was this video 2 months ago when i bought a spectre
Intel 2030 - Still on 14nm+++++++++++, i11 201100KXZTV, 20 Cores, 40 Threads, Base clock: 0.7 GHz, Boost clock: 6.1 GHz, TDP:  91W, Maximum power draw: 1200W.




















i just bought one! and its worth very penny
PCs and laptop were supposed to be cheaper every year, now the are all the contrary :(
Too bad about the 16:9 aspect ratio, otherwise it could be a great portable dev machine
The iGPU on the Ryzen 5 4500u is comparable to Nvidia&#39;s MX150! Without the extra cost! Or the extra power consumption!
I swear to god the title was different?
Man Linus getting more beefier and beefier
why do people still use bananas for scale? cant you like.. use a coke/pepsi can?
Loved the laptop revolving on the balls shot.... Pretty fuckin cool. LTT&#39;s production has become increasingly movie like over the years. Props to every editor.
I have large hands but I still think this laptop is for me. I&#39;m a large human.
Best buy just dropped the pricing on the 15&quot; Envy with the R7 to 750, insane deal
I LOVE YOU
Do. Not. Put. Your. Wrist. On. The. Computer.
Dropped 800€ on an HP with an i7-8750H with no ssd, 12gb of RAM and a 4 GB gtx1050. The temperatures fucking skyrocket at the mere mention of a Simulink compilation. As soon as you fire up Steam it reaches sixty degrees. The battery life is deplorable, at 4 hours if you don&#39;t do much other than twitter. The form factor is of a gaming pc, and is a pain to carry since it&#39;s heavier than an ultrabool.<br><br>Fuck me. I feel robbed.
Love the use of the probe lens lately :D<br><br>Glad to see that lens having some use lately!
Bruh moment #39
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m21s">7:21</a> and wear GLOVES and bring HAND SANITIZER!<br>Don&#39;t forget that!
Love to see you guys using the Laowa Lens for sick macro shots.<br>Quick suggestion for the shooting crew, when recording these macros, have one of those air cans in hand. Blow that dust, hairs etc and start shooting right away. We sometimes even continue spraying at recording to avoid dust settling.<br>Great work as always
Is the 16gb/512gb with Ryzen 7 model worth it compared to the Ryzen 5 model here?
About that Zephyrus G14...<br>Are you sure about that $1449.99? In my country the most recently sold price was around €2200 (near $2500), and it is currently out of stock in literally every webshop.<br>Edit: Moreover, the 4700 / 1650 variant is available, but that one is at the moment €1500 (near $1700).<br>Edit2: The featured laptop in this video is $799, but here it is €899 ($1004). Why is America so favoured?
Those are nice macro shots, more of that please!
&quot;This is my whole weekend&quot;.. Mantra extraordinaire
16:9 in a laptop is a no go for me. But this might sway me
LTT production qualities are getting out of hand<br><br>This is Making it hard for me to watch other channels








Me: * cries in surface laptop 2 *



actually wanna buy the 4700u model for university.<br>hoped for a spectre series model with maybe 4800u and dedicated gpu.<br>Valorant or CS go benchmark would have been great. i dont know what difference the igpus make between the ryzen 5 and 7
i wish they did a thinkpad x1 yoga with ryzen 4000, and update the ram for ddr4. Intel uhd 630 sucks and i can&#39;t believe a laptop is stuck with ddr3 in 2020
Shoulda seen that segue coming 🤦‍♂️
You&#39;re really milking that laowa 14mm, I love the look on those shots!
Brandon must be having a lot of fun with them probe lens
Is it HP or PQ?
I&#39;m proud of my (not very techy) sister doing the research and going the AMD way.
Somebody got a new lens
Xeon laptop
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=2m37s">2:37</a> lol i thought that&#39;s PH tshirts
It’s 600 at costco
I&#39;m wanting to see more expensive high end AMD laptops. Eg. If HP took the top of the range 2020 Spectre 15, doubled the RAM, and switched to AMD, it would be perfect.<br>I&#39;m really hoping they do offer an AMD version in 2021.
Deja Vu !!! I saw linus in pulseway ad and he is cheating on his wife with a hot date Just kidding it was a Fooking Ad !!!
I bought the 3500 version envy just the previous month.... Only if I waited 😓
A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> spectre with a Ryzen 8 core is an instabuy for me
Look&#39;s like Linus bought a probe camera lens
Why big companies are not giving amd a chance in gaming laptop
can that thing game <br><br>probs not lol
at this point we are forced to use AMD
When will we see AMD powered flagships like XPS 13/15/17 and similar
Intel: <b>Exists</b><br><br>Me: <b>Man, that kinda cringe</b>
Wow, this is impressive. I will say, I have had issues with the hinge and screen casing on my 2017 HP Envy x360, and I see people online with similar issues, even on newer models. With that being said, all laptops have a chance at breaking. I really am impressed with how much, and how quickly, AMD has improved in the mobile space.
Intel clearly contacted LTT about the original title. Probably discussed revoking some or all of his &quot;compensation&quot; if a correction wasn&#39;t made. Money talks, and it talks so loudly for Intel that Renoir has yet to find its way into a truly o premium laptop, in spite of being better all the way around.
Can we get vids on the AMD thinkpads?
How times can change
Hp laptops are junk hinges always break off made of plastic.
Everyone should move to 3:2 displays.<br>Which is great for erganomics and thermals.
can you pls build another keyboard things have changed in 2020 you should build a $150 dollar budget
Apparently the Ryzen 5 4500U performs as well or better than an i7 8750H, which I have in my main laptop... I&#39;m getting beat by a 13 inch ultrabook...
Are there any that have a good (size) keyboard and a ryzen 4800u?  What about 4GHz LPDDR4x ram?
is amd better for gaming ?? tell me!
I&#39;d love an AMD laptop... My razer blade 15 is powerful but it also cooks my legs and throttles consistently, whilst having less battery life than an RC car...
It&#39;s on sale now in the US with a $200 discount; around $580
It&#39;s a bit unnerving to hear Alex talk about his experience and then see what I suspect are Andy&#39;s hands act out what Alex is talking about.
Trackpad takes 1/4th of lower part of a laptop and is BIG.<br>LTT : &quot;Trackpad is undersized&quot;<br>Errrm WHAT ?
i have the same laptop with the 2500u, it sucks. wish i had waited just two more years for this one or 3 for zen3 or tiger lake, also this laptop has a problem where it thermal throttles at  likr 75C instead of 105C. also just wait like 3 more months, from 800, it will go to 600. Thats how cheap my ryzen 5 2500u was in this laptop
Show off for the new macro lens🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dominate me AMD-sama uWu
Nice title change, cant let daddy intel get mad at you.
At Intel HQ: (shakily) sir what&#39;s our next move?  &quot;Power&quot;. huh? &quot;THE POWER LIMITS OVER 9000!!!
Linus: AMD Laptops are basically better in almost every way.<br><br>Intel: Cries in the background





















I hate how Linus says Asus with a hard u. I know that this is probably the correct way to say it but I still hate it. Always said it (irl or in my head) with a soft u.
May be LTT now has the micro camera and also gone review it
Man you guys sure love that new probe lens eh?!
Yep ok I’m buying the ryzen 7 version
I&#39;m really enjoying the new camera movements... Love for the camera crew ♥️
Is it even possible to buy a bare boned laptop now a days? I mean with only windows and no other crap. I need to buy a gaming laptop when I visit my family in Portugal and I am actually considering buying one to take over for my desktop and just hooking it up with an external GPU when I am home.<br>&#39;<br>Need to check on laptops and 144 fps /1440p performance (With an external GPU)
Wonder when the XPS series is switching to AMD
&quot;Quick! We need b-roll!&quot;<br>&quot;Get the balls.&quot;
AMD is ushering us into a new era (or meta) of tech and it&#39;s beautiful to witness it unfold.
I am just waiting for these amd chips in come in laptop with RTX 2070 or higher<br>But sadly Intel won&#39;t let them do it
rip its up to $2400 CAD on Amazon now
Where do you get the sticker in the ltt store website

For the CPU power AMD might be a good choice, but for the intergrated GPU I still have no trust in AMD. My 2-year-old Envy 13 x360 with Ryzen 2500U is still not able to update the GPU driver to the Adrenalin 2020 Edition. It&#39;s an issue from HP that the AMD drivers conflict with their power plans but I haven&#39;t met such a thing in the past years of downloading official drivers directly from Intel and Nvidia.<br><br>By the way, speaking of HP, I&#39;m gald they finally realised laptop CPUs can run at over 80 degrees. Gaining some more power by losing the facial recognition it used to have is an acceptable trade off tho.
Hello today i bot mi a nu gamingskrin and ay dident get de stand and all de cabuls so i nid to bay a nu wan and ay going to los 255 dolar do i livs in swiden and dat is akspensive.
Bro you had me at 6core wish xps 13 9300 would use this 6core chip
I think Intel needs to let the Core i series die. Even when they eventually manage to make something new and competitve again I don&#39;t think that this product should have the same name as that junk.
<b>AMD battery life goes brrrr</b>
Just wanted to say that all of the macro shots look great
Also why is Apple MBP 16&quot; not on Ryzen 4000 already!!!
Linus would you take my i5 4440 and I’d take one of your gaming pc’s
How could anyone with even the smallest amount of research still buy an Intel CPU?<br><br>Even if you wanted a premium model , you&#39;re better off waiting until the OEMs put AMD into higher end laptops
Why is Dell XPS 15 and 17 not on Ryzen 4000 already!!!
One day Linus will ran out smooth transitions

A Segway is a scooter
Lenovo naming their laptop flex 14<br>Linus surprised it flexes
It doesn&#39;t matter if it is Intel, AMD or Fujitsuraradamadingdong - companies should use the best available bang for buck components in their products. Informed customers don&#39;t like being sold short knowing that there is something cheaper and better but the company refuses to use it because they have &#39;back handers&#39; going to certain influential company execs. e.g. Why do manufacturers push so many Intel laptops when -at the moment - AMD mobile is king for the price?
Imagine an AMD XPS
That is the most annoying segway ever. Are you fucking kidding me? That was so sneaky.
Bought this laptop for myself about 6 months ago. Have been loving it for all my needs. I&#39;m going to school to get my B.A. in software development.  Some lite gaming on top of that and haven&#39;t been disappointed yet. I would be careful with how long you leave it plugged into the charger though. I left mine plugged in over a weekend and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve gotten the same battery life out of it since.
That segway got me
This is great.But AMD needs a halo product to beat Intel.
I hate to defend Intel but honestly their going to destroy AMD on performance when they release a chipset on 10 nm.
Lovin them macro shots... Keep em comin!

How to ruin your chances of Intel sponsoring you 101:
You always feel like some of these OEMs have agreements with Intel to out AMD CPUs in lower end models....cause they must know it&#39;s the best mobile CPU





Amd worst because they dont have an option to choose between integrated and dedicated graphics card

Again AMD paid Linus
This is the first time I&#39;ve seen Linus giving out ads without spending extra time for it
Bought this exact laptop but the 15.6&quot; version a couple weeks ago when it was on sale at Best Buy. I believe it&#39;s on sale again!
That was one of the smoothest segues that I have ever seen on this channel, Linus stepping up his game
Daily reminder that the &quot;TIPS&quot; in the new intro is bigger than &quot;LINUS TECH&quot;
lol... I snagged me one of those x360 15.6in  for $600 a few weeks ago with
I use a 15&quot; Envy X360 with a Ryzen 5 3000 series CPU at work and can agree it&#39;s an excellent laptop... With the exception of the Realtek Wi-Fi. The Realtek Wi-Fi just will not connect reliably to the Cisco enterprise-grade access points we have. That being said, swapping the Realtek Wi-Fi card for an Intel one was not a big challenge.
Now I know why it’s cheeper - no graphics card.
I&#39;m still gonna buy a AMD, when I can buy one.

I have no idea what he’s saying but I’m here anyway.
Gos dammit Andy that was too funny.
Who&#39;s that guy looking at <a href="http://lttstore.com/">LTTstore.com</a>?
All I gotta say is intel got OUTPLAYED!
Load it up with Ubuntu or some other Linux distro and I will buy it. C&#39;mon hp. Let&#39;s get it done.

Dell needs to start putting Ryzen in the XPS 13. I love the XPS but not it&#39;s CPU selection.
Techquicky suggestion - Why are laptop manufacturers switching to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> display or something around those lines
I love the smell of competition. Let them battle it out, the consumers are the winners.
Intel is really envying AMD right now
Got the 4700u, 16gb, 512gb ssd, for 950 euros best laptop ever, buy it if you need this kind of laptop best deal at the moment
A tip by yours truly, MKBHD: Don&#39;t overuse the probe lens.<br><br>I counted 4 probe lens shots. Please don&#39;t overuse that lens. It depreciates the lens&#39; value.
The probe lens shots are sweet!
In my country (UAE) ,AMD laptops are way cheaper with better hardware, the problem not alot knows about AMD.
I like it new logo of hp
Jesus Linus is in full gear again making videos. He ain’t retiring shiiiiiat
Watching this video on my 2018 Envy 13 x360 with 2500U. Great hardware and many reasons to love it but rubbish thermals and battery life is nothing to speak about. Because of the thermal throttling, I can only get Cinebench R20 score of 768. Doing nothing but watching youtube and the bottom is 42 deg C. Good to see that the new Envy is such a great performer in what looks like the same chassis. Battery life is nearly half of that of my Latitude 7390 which has the same battery capacity. Some weird bugs like audio starts playing only after 2 seconds, Bluetooth headphones get disconnected automatically every once in a while. <br>The 2018 model does have Windows Hello facial recognition, which is super good, and 4 B&amp;O speakers which sound really good, and a more premium design.
&quot;$800? Man, that&#39;s unbelievably cheap for a genuinely good computer!&quot; I thought to myself hearing that, but then I searched online for a local price, and the price here was $1300 (USD equivalence) ..
LOL, I can&#39;t even find this laptop on HP&#39;s online store in Canada.  In fact their laptop search filter doesn&#39;t even list AMD Ryzen 5 as a CPU option at all.
And , with a line of codes in cmd you&#39;ll get ultimate performance mode

I actually bought the 15.6&quot; variant of the HP Envy x360 yesterday for $745.
AMD - (A)sk (M)om &amp; (D)ad to buy this.
I wish instead of focusing on getting Type A ports on a Laptop, I wish tech influencers would complain that Desktops and Peripherals aren&#39;t using Type C enough yet.
i literally got an x360 for christmas. god dammit
Glad to see this laptop finally getting an upgrade! I bought the  Envy x360 13z from a few years ago with the Ryzen 2600U for $600 (with Best Buy’s student discount) and it’s easily held up in workstation use still to this day.
It&#39;s just a matter of time that AMD takes over the market. <br><br>The other day, after begging my parents to buy me a laptop for 10 months, they finally bought me one!! I got a lenovo flex 5 14 inch with an AMD ryzen 5 4500U with AMD radeon graphics, 16 GB of RAM, and 512 GB of SSD. It is a 2 in 1 laptop, for only 999.99 CDN. It&#39;s doing the BEST at anything, to be honest. The only downside that I have with this lenovo is that the battery SUCKS. I mean, it barely last 3 hours when I&#39;m gaming, but it does do the job. Out of everything here, it is a very good laptop!! (I am also going to post this on the LTT forums, go check it out!!)
Lenovo Flex 14: Flexes<br>Linus: HUUUUUUUUUUUH
Any chance you guys will do a review of the HP Probook 455 G7 with the Ryzen 7 4700U
Trump would love this laptop.
HP’s logo looks like its flipping off whoever looks at it
Tbh, thunderbolt is the only reason many people still holding their intel based laptop. If USB4 is released and OEM decided to put it in their laptop then I see no reason to buy an intel laptop
I see you bought a new lens

Who else watched AMD ad before starting the Video ...hit like <br>👇🏻
Its almost as if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> is better than 16:9 and we should have never switched to 16:9 in the first place.
i like it :v
The ASUS Zenbook 14&quot; Q407IQ-BR5N4, a Ryzen 5 4500U with dedicated graphics, picked mine up at Best Buy for $550 while on sale,absolutely unbeatable when considering it has a dedicated graphics chip too!  AMD really changed the landscape for laptops now too at long last, I was very sick of the monopoly Intel has had on all laptops that were not bottom of the barrel.
Costco has a sale on the 15 inch with $200 off, I&#39;d highly recommend!
Laowa everything 🤣
I legit have this laptop and this was quite the upgrade to my other laptop.

That was the best damn segway Linus has ever done
Liked all the new Macro shots. Upping the B Roll game!
8Gb is pathetic and insufficient nowadays
Those close-up slider shots are 🔥
it doesnt matter, people are going to buy apple anyway ! :(
I can&#39;t wait to finally have 4:3 laptops again!

Linus voice crack at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a>
WOW!<br>&quot;DY&quot; laptop
Do not spend money on any of this and buy an xps.
Why hp? Your envy with the 2060 has the stupid intel cpu, WHY?!??!? Put that with the ryzen and that would be the best laptop of the year. I just want somebody to make a ryzen laptop with a 2060, a touchscreen and freaking webcam (I’m looking at you ASUS!!!) and that isn’t a freaking gaming chunky block... why is this SO DIFFICULT?!?!?
I was actually gqnna buy this lqptop, but it will be sold out so quick since you made a vid about it:(
Loved that close up keyboard shots
I guess burying INTEL 6ft under the ground isn&#39;t enough, all the way to the Earth&#39;s core then.
So 2 hours isn&#39;t good battery life for laptops?
linus how was your gaming yestrday?
I use a internet made of only smart fridges
You know it&#39;s LTT when the title changes
Is it me or is the audio ever so slightly out of sync with the video?
Intel is almost dead, apple and pc manufacturers moving away from intel.
as a person who doesnt use track pads (i hate them with a passion)  it doesnt really bother me. Additionally , as an Asian man with a rather smaller body than the humongous Americans and Europeans, i think the keyboard is fine.
Is AMD China made and Intel USA made?<br><a href="https://youtu.be/Qt1z5YfaO_Y">https://youtu.be/Qt1z5YfaO_Y</a>


<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> Aspect Ratio, the Golden Ratio, that was pretty common on monitors in 2010 and is coming back to laptops. I find this really funny for Linus to use as a nitpick.









Nicee
A solid video title and prices mentioned up front!? <br>Big thumbs up!
Finally a laptop worth my money, yet in my country is about 1.200 USD Dollars. I hate living here.
Stop Changing the goddamn title
Linus  doubling down on the AMD stock market insider trading LMAO he gonna get locked up.




My i9 9900k is not happy about this.
I own the Envy x360, and I absolutely LOVE IT!
This will probably change things in the business world. Before, you used to only see workstations laptops that only have intel CPUs but that&#39;s going to change with the emergence of these AMD CPUs.
i still have arguments with intel fanboys who can&#39;t accept what amd have produced.
I have the x360 2019, and in the refurbished market, I got mine for a cool £600 with warranty. It is basically the same apart from no drop down usb a (it is only slightly thicker, so it has the same io as the 2020), and has a top firing speaker at the top of the keyboard, and a larger bottom bezzle to accomidate that. the Ryzen 5 3500U is quad core at 3.7 boost (same as the spectre 2020 ... wow) so the performance is in the same ball park. The 2020 brings smaller bottom bezzle, and the 4000 series processors. I cannot reccomend the 2019 version enough, as it has all the features of a much pricer laptop at half the price.<br><br>the keys are firm, and the complaints about the keyboard palm rest are nit valid for me, and I have medium sized hands for the UK male. the touchscreen is really useful, but I never seem to use it in tablet mode - but that is a personal preference. I have noticed that you have to put it in battery optimisation mode in windows on battery power for the battery life to be good, but then I run it on max brightness, and when I put it down to 75% brightness, the battery life is awesome. <br><br>I am a student, so my budget was modest, and to have a premium laptop is awesome - and the only other feasable laptop for this price would be a pavilion 14, or a dell latitude  -and those are all plastic. as a student, I have no regrets at all with this laptop, and it is snappy for my word processing workflow. the speakers are very good, but I found that you need to go into the bang and olufsen sound settings and give it a bit more bass - and then it is good. It is worth noting that it actually has 6gb of useable RAM as the APU uses 2gb for graphics memory. this isn&#39;t a problem for mobile workloads, as I would have 10 chrome tabs open with video conferencing for the online schooling, and it is fine - I don&#39;t think that it is a problem. <br><br>For gaming, I manage around 30 fps in e-sports (World of Warships) games on low - medium, but I believe that the 2020 model has a more powerful gpu, but 30fps is console frame-rates anywho, so I don&#39;t mind. I don&#39;t really game on this too much, as I mostly use my iPad for that. <br><br>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENVY X360 SERIES<br><br>Hey Linus, I know that you read through around half of the comments, so there is a good chance that you will see this: I would just like to say that you are one of the most hard-working people on this platform, and you should be really proud of the company you have made!
Did you change the title of your video again? Lol
Who thinks  of the weird things like spinning the HP laptop on the ballpit balls lmao. <br>It was cool but where does this idea even spring from lol.
Can the 4000 series support external displays at 144Hz? Is it over usb-c to a hub?
what is wrong with the gain when it transitions from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m45s">6:45</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m47s">6:47</a>? LMG QUALITY CONTROL MUCH?
Still waiting on a good Lenovo Thinkpad with Ryzen 4000 mobile
Sadly they offer the 16gb option only with the more expensive ryzen 7 cpu with no upgrade path.
If it had a trackpoint I&#39;d get one for sure. I need my nip
im still confused..not about hp&#39;s decision but about what a segway is
Me: oh nice laptop<br>Linus:  USE GLASSWIRE!!
YOOO THE NEW INTRO

Free stickers???
WHERE IS the AMD 2080 super Lenovo 7i?!?
I bet Intel is paying HP, Dell, Lenovo from designing and selling each line with an equivalent build / feature set other than AMD or Intel CPUs so people could choose the best option. Right now Intel would not only continue to lose sales but lose Face.
you are overdoing the macro shots
I’ve been using an HP spectre laptop for general productivity (no heavy cpu or gpu use) and personally the amazing build quality is why I’ve stuck with it for almost 6 years now. Even if the envy can beat it punch for punch on performance I wouldn’t trade off the (in my opinion) excellent keyboard and key feel or the amazing stiffness of the milled aluminum chassis. I can appreciate from a reviewer perspective why the recommendation went where it did but for my use case and in my experience having the premium build and feel was and is of much greater benefit.
&quot;This is my whooooole weekend&quot;<br>Idk why that cracked me up goven it&#39;s so cheesy


Will very funny when Intel decided to buy ad slots in LTT segue and turn out praising AMD products
Underrated feature:<br>having the micro sd slot,mean you can put some 256/512 Gb micro sd and use like additional space for cheap.
Did any one else notice he changed the title of the vid?
My son has the hp laptop with the Ryzen 3000 series Apu ..and I thought that was impressive compared to my 2 year old i5 laptop ...this hp looks like its going to be my next laptop ...if only I could afford to ditch my aging 7700k in my big rig ...I&#39;d love a Ryzen 9 system.
Pls make video on computer programmer which type of laptop used...
I got this laptops 2019 version last year with a ryzen 5 3500u and 256gb SSD and it’s pretty good. I got it on sale for around $600 (on sale + student discount) and as a school laptop it’s held me over really well. I had one issue with the SSD shorting out on me but warranty replaced it with no trouble
After watching this, one of the questions I have is if the laptop fell while filming it spinning on those colored balls.
Ahhh, Brandon is playing with his new probe lens I see.
My mum has that laptop and now I want it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=5m49s">5:49</a> No, Linus, that&#39;s a MICRO SD card reader. Different format. Not interchangable. Also not used by most cameras.

I have a feeling that Intel is going to be the next Nokia.
intel is dead unless they get something better and lower their prices
4800h nearly hits 3700x levels of performance
tbh AMD is better than Intel in my experience<br><br>Except for some reason my laptop doesn&#39;t like running minecraft unless I have a mod like BetterFPS... dunno what causes it. My old intel laptop ran MC better.
Linus is awfully close to switching me over to AMD
I just realized every LTT review is about Linus and his team being Butt hurt that products aren’t made specifically for them 😂😂 “my hands are too big, hp why are you not considering the sides of my hands” 😂😂😂😂
Let&#39;s just say the words, AMD YES!!
I&#39;m looking at my Lenovo 330s 8th Gen i7 that I picked up cheap last year and I&#39;m wondering if I should trade it in for a nice new AMD machine already...
Actually good segue
I have last year&#39;s model envey it&#39;s really great for a student
Brandon enjoying the lockdown by getting new toys 👍👍
I just don&#39;t understand why I hate AMD though &lt;_&gt;
&quot;In the low prices models&quot;<br>-Present a 700 dollars laptop<br>Me: .....<br>Really, I think that the real average is 500 dollars.

















Damn Alex has way bigger hands than I expected.
I have had my X360 13&quot; with an R7 2700u for a coupld years now and I am very happy with it. Performance, screen etc is great. i do with it had a larger track pad though.
I ordered a Dell XPS 15, it a shame that they don&#39;t come with AMD options or else that would have made an excellent laptop even better...
I just wish that more and more ultrabook come up with 16 gb RAM more easily accessible or provide the RAM upgrade option for the ultrabooks
Guy typing in background with tiny hands reminded me of telebrands commercials !!
I don&#39;t know why would anyone buy Intel pros which are twice as priced and not even half the benchmark to AMD ?
are there any 17 inch ryzen 2 in 1s yet? my current intel based 2 in 1 has some really annoying coil whine
&quot;Now&quot; lol the Envy X360 is a 3 year old product that I&#39;ve been using for over 2. Bought it for 500 bucks on black Friday. Now its become pretty slow though lmao. I got the 15 inch so it comes with windows hello
I see that you guys got a new lens for those close shots. I see you 👀
The drop is a lie, got in said I only have $10 off instead of $20 as new user, after registered they didn&#39;t even provide the $10 off, the headset is still $50, I am from Hong Kong, don&#39;t know if that matters
but is this laptop have thunderbolt ?
Holy shit, this is the first time I&#39;ve thought about upgrading my laptop. I probably don&#39;t need it though...
What’s new
i so cant wait to see what their gaming focused gpus are going to be like
Intel guys, if you&#39;re reading this, find yourselves a new job, because,if Corona doesn&#39;t come for you, AMD is !
Who is the guy hosting the video?
You can literally compare Dell machine with this HP Envy X360😋😋
intel is garbage and i use intel cause im forced to
LOL they changed the title. The original one was &quot;Should you even CONSIDER an Intel laptop?&quot;
This gives me hope that there will be bios and driver updates for my HP 15 with ryzen 7 3700u vega 10 to stop the 60 degree Celsius hectic thermal throttle and I can actually boost over 3 GHz CPU and 1200 GHz GPU
AMD really bounced back hard
I can’t see anyone mention it. But the camera work in this video is really dope looking
Intel: We are winning o laptops<br>AMD: <b><i>Hold up</i></b>


Look the title changed 😂😂 the original title was &quot;should you buy an Intel laptop anymore&quot; or something. Guess sponsorship works 😂
Linus looks like an older Bryce Hall
I&#39;m blown away by the fact HP does have laptops that have great hardware and <b>not</b> crappy screens, which always was the fact not long ago. We even joked around at work: Is it a laptop with good hardware and made by HP? Hah! Crappy panel galore! \o/!&quot;
Like 8,9k
&quot;16x9 is one of their failures&quot;  no, its fine, stop being picky
Just bought a AMD CPU with AMD gpu laptop <br><br>Feeling good today
Finally a proper sub 1000$ reccomendation for above average power. Thanks for the budget love totally look forward to more
AMD Ryzen 5 3600X vs AMD Ryzen 7 2700X which of these 2 is better for video editing(after effects specific)
Yea these laptops are cool and all but I&#39;m going to need that shirt
First time I am this early , why does ltt only upload at 10 to 11 pm lol
Original title: &quot;Should you even CONSIDER an Intel laptop?&quot;<br>Edit: The bots have invaded the replies











Shout-out to the Lenovo flex 5, ryzen 4500u 16gb of ram 2 in 1 1080p screen for only $599.99 in Amazon
LTT crew: this laptop doesn&#39;t have very good ergonomics<br>Me with a Sony Vaio duo 13: <b>do you even get any ergonomics?</b>
Number 915th lol
Did anyone ever clicked that &quot;Avoid YouTube comments&quot; pop up in Linus videos????... Where does it take you (•▲•)
Man I freakin love the new intro
Too bad Intel pays off all the OEMs to keep AMD out of the top tier designs
I’m hoping for  an AMD RTX STUDIO laptop at a more reasonable price than the current intel ones.
Way to go AMD
If you had all those problems fixed on the 360 you would not pay 700 more like 1800.. you cry over nothing if you want a better p.c. cough up another 1000
Hey man with the beard, where are you hiding Linus Tech Tips?... did u tie him up in the basement?
Bananaforscale
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> <br>Voice crack

Guys, does anyone know, if Linus Tech Tips has merchandise?
Shut up alex... Shouldn&#39;t he be doing some incompetent work instead?
whats the background music during vid? good song
Looking at the links and I can&#39;t even find the model lmao. per the usual for companies. Also inb4 scalpers.
This is a great machine. I have personally bought over 9 of them for friends and family who needed them. Everyone loves it. Bestbuy also has a 15&quot; model with lower screen colors and bright was but good for many ppl.
Every-time they mention the Lenovo Flex 14 they always bring up the non rigidity of the frame. I think that might just be the older model. I have a Flex 14 and mine doesn&#39;t have any deck flex and the screen isn&#39;t as floppy as they show. Anyone else?
lenuvo flex 14 is better.
Would be cool if you coul buy the damn g14 ANYWHERE in german languaged Europ - there is not a single unit to get -.-
I was just looking at buying this thing, nice to have a review :)
HP: soooooooo you&#39;re saying it&#39;s too cheap? Noted.



Yeah, I would not trust HP with AMD. We use HP EliteDesk 800 for most of our workstations, but due to supply shortages we got EliteDesk 705 which is exactly the same but uses AMD Ryzen... I have not seen that much blue screen in my life... Granted it&#39;s a desktop and not a laptop, but I don&#39;t trust HP with AMD at the moment
Fingerprint scanner over windows hello faceID all day!
The Ryzen 7 model is cheaper right now too at $757
it seems that Brandon got a new toy
Anyone noticed the similarities between this video&#39;s soundtrack and MC_HAMMER_U_CAN&#39;T_TOUCH_THIS.mp3

My tuf fx-505g has a i5 9300u with a gtx 1650 and I got it 300 dollars off on Black Friday. I know tuf doesn’t exactly have the best reputation it has GPU!!!!! For $850 at normal price
Most unexpected Segway on a litt video
I just looked the laptop up and almost every AMD configuration is unavaible. Only the Intel ones are in stock
I was thinking about getting myself a surface pro, but this might be a better alternative
I&#39;m happy that we finally got here
I was not ready for that segway like WHAAAAT?!
Intel is dead. Long live the king
Try the Lenovo Ideapad 5 as well, the 14&quot; model seems like a bargain
Video title before Linus changed it:  Should you even consider buying an Intel laptop?
What about docking? I&#39;m on the process of deciding for and buying an Ultrabook because I want productivity (software development mostly) and I&#39;m not a gamer so I don&#39;t really benefit from graphics cards that much. I&#39;m also a student so a desktop doesn&#39;t really work for me either way, I&#39;m always moving with my laptop. That gets me to what I most like about Intel laptops: Thunderbolt, and their capability to have only one device for desktop and on the go. The thing is, the Envy X360 doesn&#39;t seem to even have a display output... I really like it, mostly for the price and form factor, but that is what will probably keep me from buying it.
Everytime someone asks me about a new laptop i always recommend the HP Envy X360s. My girlfriend rocks a 15&quot; with the 8th Gen i5 and my sister a 15&quot; with the 3000 series AMD APUs. Now with Zen 2 they are even better. The 15&quot; Models have very sturdy bodys out of aluminium and proper IO, so you don&#39;t need dongles.  Great machines that last longer than my laptops in the past. My next one will be a Zen 2 X360 15&quot; too.
not available in my country
hi linus :)
Yay. Now the actual laptop I was looking to buy will immediately be out of stock.
Only<br>Intel ligent people will buy<br>Intel processors
your making me feel like intel shouldn&#39;t do cpus anymore...
Original title: should you even consider buying a Intel laptop












































I have a Lenovo V14ARE with a Ryzen 4500U. I am glad that I made that purchase. It came with a PCIE 256GB SSD. I Added a 2TB SATA SSD for storage for 200 more USD. I paid about the same for the Lenovo and would like to see it added to comparison. There is also a version that would have came with a 1TB HDD. I paid 618 USD for the lENOVO v14are This was after shipping. The unit lists for 545.92 on Newegg and gets 5 Eggs. Of course having only 1 review, mine. Nice machine for running Emulators, and daily use. Runs GTA 5 at low res smoothly, 800x600. I&#39;m being fair to it. This is on the Radeon graphics thats built in. Needs more GPU Memory, only thing holding it back.
I think I just found my college laptop
Finally, a laptop video
Intel bad amd good
Nice changing the title😄
Oh my, that Ryzen Surface better come soon
New Ryzen laptops launch. <br>Le Linus :- Okay let&#39;s humiliate Intel.
Hp needs to fix their up down arrow keys and battery degradation(as in how many years it will work without battery replacement)
This just in: water is wet.
Me: <b>looks at my 1 year old $1400 lenovo laptop with an i7 that&#39;s already starting to slow down</b>
Title changed?!
What is me liking this just for that segue??
I think AMD laptops are cheaper because of build quality, GPU choice and screen choice. Not AMD&#39;s fault but I would like to see manufactures start using high end parts for the AMD laptops.
I got a Linus ad, pulseway
I like the &quot;Should you EVEN buy a laptop&quot; title better ha.
Alpha Alex: the keyboard is too small for my big manly hands. <br>Beta Linus: The keyboard is perfect for my weak little hands.<br>Lol
Now is this a deep fake
I saw the Newegg model with the R7 4700U for 800$. I really love AMD right now. (I still can&#39;t afford it but you know, still really nice to see competition!).
I like AMD so much more simply because my lap top does not get uncomfortably HOT in my lap.  And battery seems to last quite a bit longer.
<b>You know what they say about guys with small hands Linus</b>
How come the Asus laptop is do hard to find to buy? It&#39;s like it didn&#39;t actually exist.
Audio sounds really bad
Lenovo slim 7 pls
Should you even consider a Intel laptop?<br>Intel : wait , that&#39;s illegal.
vBest bit ar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m02s">6:02</a> lol hahaha
I am the 933 th commenter
Btw you can get this for $570 at Best Buy
dat segue make me dying XD
Would you guys recommend the Envy or the $1000 G14?
I bought the 15.6 inch version with a 512GB NVME from Costco for $600 a few weeks ago and it has been spectacular.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=7m58s">7:58</a> Banana for scale?
I am surprised that Linus doesn&#39;t has a problem with that trackpad, given how much he troubled with the last HP device (Spectre)
ha, tiny hands.  I have piano hands, long thin fingers.
I know. This is why I am not even considering Intel for my laptop option. Not even the better gpus will make get a laptop without a R4k chip in it. I&#39;m just waiting for the Ryzen stuff to get at least 2080 performance in games. Which I&#39;m guessing most companies are waiting to roll out better models when the new GPU generations make it to their market. That better be the case or they flat out ignored a market segment
Soldered ram is a turn off
Stop killing Intel...they’re already dead
So - the Intel-based Laptop has a very poor thermal solution and the CPU is constantly throttling - and how is that Intels fault now?<br>And Screen ratio: Seriously?? It was cause people constantly claimed that 16:9 would be oh so great. Just give me back good old 4:3 Waaaayyyy better for actually working with screens.
My favorite Segway©
I don&#39;t need or want a gaming laptop or a mobile workstation. I just need a thin and light.  I&#39;ve been buying Dell XPS 13&#39;s for years. If they don&#39;t have a Ryzen this gen, and they don&#39;t seem to, I&#39;ll be switching to something that does. The better performance and vastly better battery life are no brainers.
But still everywhere i go i see only intel laptops barely any AMD laptops
My HP Envy 13 (2017 i5 7200u) has 2x USB A and 2x USB C WITH a barrel power connector. I honestly believe it&#39;s not done now because they get to save 80 cents per model or some bullshit which happened to = all groceries of the guy which made the decision.
the linus we all know... roasting intel as always

I wish I had one of these laptop
i like to see a comp lenovo ideapad (ryzen version) 5 vs hp envy x360
My girlfriend has the 2018 version I think? <br>Anyway, it’s AMD and it’s a great laptop.<br>However, the HDD it came with was glacial slow....<br>Upgraded to a 970 evo m.2 and now it’s acceptable.
I really wish that the AMD gaming notebooks didn&#39;t get crappy cooling and better graphic options. Other companies is really giving love to intel notebooks rather than the AMD ones. :(
I actually like my core i5 in the surface pro 7. That device is more about the form factor and not the cpu
Linus: Hey guys today we had a new iPhone drop!<br>Us: oh sick iPhone 12??!!<br>Linus: *Drops the new iPhone 12 and its the only prototype in the world *<br>Us: eh
HP giving us the middle finger there?
Those macro b-rolls looked awesome in this video, good job team LMG
no one is going to talk about the brett renlo at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m10s">6:10</a> ? okay....
Dude I just bought the last year&#39;s model xD
What about the Acer Swift 3?
Yay AMD. If you say good about Intel, you shill.
Your B rolls have been getting a quite a bit better lately, keep up the good work!
Now give me an AMD Ryzen 4000 laptop with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> display. That&#39;s all I want in life. 16:9 is an abomination
To be fair, Ice Lake should be avoided by all as CPUs performance are also lower than Comet Lake (14nm) lineup but they are getting a far better iGPU then the latter and are a step behind AMD iGPU.<br>Btw the next 10nm lineup looks promising (Tiger Lake) as CPUs performance looks like on pair with Comet Lake and the iGPU will be also better then the actual on Ice Lake but it&#39;s probabily 5 months apart and after another 3-5 months the new Ryzen will show up. So the question before buying should be &quot;Did I need those kind of performance now?&quot;.
The one time I didn&#39;t see the Segway coming. <br><br>Ran me right the frig over.
now I&#39;m thinking to sell my budget gaming laptop for this portable thin and light laptop
give it some more time ;) they will get on that premium level

Yeah, that&#39;s cool but with HP drivers are shit!
watching this on my lenovo flex 5 equipped with a ryzen 5 4500U and 16gbs of ram. LOVE IT!
X86/X64 is dead...ARM and maybe Risc-V remain in the future...X86/X64 will face the same destiny as PPC already did...but because of PPC disappeared in the desktop market, I feel really sad and somtimes I&#39;m setup...why the hell PPC had to go...PPC is still a good architecture...100% risc and so on...
Intel laptops suck
Spectre. How appropriate. Follow up: Meltdown.
The logo on the back of the hp reminds me of a middle finger (to intel) ^^
Looks like Andy is having too much fun with the new macro lens presumably the Laowa Macro Probe Lens. <br>While I like the shots I feel it&#39;s a bit too much of those shots in 1 video. I&#39;d say that lens should be used only in high detailed shots like you&#39;ve used it here with the typing test but the macro shot of the connector and many others were a bit useless imo.
Can we get a review of msi gp 75
Linus,Riley,Dennis,Anthony, Someone... I Like Most Would Love To See The HP Envy Vs ASUS G14... Plez
Anything without TB3 is junk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m17s">4:17</a> lmao
That maco shot was good
Looks like someone is having fun with a new lens
1. omen is their gaming flagships..and i&#39;m frustrated that they are not making a 15inch gaming monster with a ryzen chip<br>2. i have not understood the appeal of a large trackpad..especially if you are not gaming..with acceleration the even a small trackpad is enough..unless you have a 4k display<br>3. even though the taller display is better, most bags are not made for these...plus content consumption becomes a problem
a year ago i bought the 2018 version of this machine.. oh how i regret it.
I used to be an AMD fan back before 2012&#39;s! Sadly, AMD slipped a bit back then in power &amp; now with the AMD Ryzen cpu&#39;s are more powerful then Intel but sadly crashes nearly(15 out of 17) every game I play vs. Intel&#39;s cpu just by loading the game!
looks like my i3 11&quot; laptop needs an upgrade that i cant afford
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m19s">4:19</a>  This is mi Hoe Weekend too.
that new HP logo is crazy but i think i like it
Just look at motherboard and heatsink design of both models and you will see how Intel still gets love.
we need  an episode of Linus doing sponsor segways one after the other.

Can’t find the free stickers on store D:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m03s">6:03</a> not necessary...at all 🤣🤣🤣
OK, but the investement in a macro lense was definetely worth it.
I used to work retail. I wonder if those conservative &quot;know it all&quot; dad customers will change their absolutist mindset about Intel being the only option.




How do you set different video names for YouTube main site and under actual video?
Someone’s using the Probe Lens
Intel&#39;s trash
Did you guys get that barrel lense or something?
can you PLEASE get segway to sponser just one video so you can have that as a segway pun.
Honestly who buys intel
Biggest mysterious question:<br>Why Linus changed the title(old is very convincing and funny)😅


AMD is embodiment of yeeaaaaaa  booooiiiiiiiiiiiii of performance. i remember getting laughed at when i defend ryzen 1st gen. now them intel fanboi wont even brave enough to talk to me.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=1m25s">1:25</a> that voicecrack
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=07m57s">07:57</a><br>did he just use a banana for scale ?? <br>fellow 9gaggers ?? anyone ??
This laptop is faster than my Desktop CPU (6600K) @ only 15Watts.
Linus, questioning about cosidering an Intel Laptop<br><br>Me: Is that even a question? I would refer AMD from the start.










Did you guys get a new macro camera?
All this guy is is a paid salesman.
Even the Envy x360 comes with pen now :)
Brandon got new toy? So many shots with lens that I saw maybe in one previous video. Im talking about this crazy close ups
I just bought a new laptop and it is an Intel i5 9th gen. I wanted an AMD but couldn&#39;t find one at a reasonable price where I live :(
Intel boasts about performance in laptops but always thermal throttles. Just put a chip in there that doesn&#39;t throttle, will have less heat output and will probably perform  better because it can sustain higher boost o wait AMD already did that. They did what Inteldont. Thanks nintendont commercial.
This guy&#39;s starting to run out of segways

bruh the title is should you consider buying an intel laptop and you change it
Until AMD laptops get better screens, creature comforts, and better GPU support from Nvidia, still keep on the Intel laptop grind and scream from the rooftops that AMD laptops deserve MUCH better.
I SWEAR THE TITLE WAS DIFFERENT A SEC AGO
How lucky that I bought my HP Spectre 2 months before the Envy came out. I would have even prefered an similar AMD machine but at the time there was no indication that AMD would deliver such beasts let alone any available option...
The small size keeps it from being exceptional... (throws a banana..) YIKES..
I have a Lenovo 5 with a 4500u. I never installed windows on it but for productivity is as fast as my 7700HQ... Except the AMD has a 70W battery that lasts 9 hours
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m18s">4:18</a> f r e e  s t i c k e r s
Ryzen 5 4500u laptops are really amazing. Too bad it&#39;s sold out everywhere. Just when my credit card is offering 10% off on any gadget bought online.
All of the machines for high-end screens (100% Adobe RGB / ~95% DCI-P3) for content creation are all still on Intel. 😢 I&#39;m really hoping 2021 is the year and I&#39;ve not upgraded yet because of this. (I think there may be some heavy, gaming laptops with this spec, but I&#39;m not looking to carry 8 lbs.)


now im mad at intel for trying to sell us &quot;new&quot; cpus which are just slightly updated versions of the previous gen with a little performance upgrade. intel based laptops are just so freaking expensive compared to what amd offers and amd even outperforms intel cpus, i hope this is a wake up call for intel to step up their game and offer better cpus for the consumers instead of releasing the same old cpus thinking that we are dumb enough to keep buying them
Pro tip: You can get 15&quot; version of this with a Ryzen 7 4700u and Decent storage and ram for less than 1000 USD.
Want to switch to Ryzen, but just can&#39;t find a Ryzen 4000 laptop that supports Thunderbolt 3.
Anyone noticed how they flexing with that fresh Laowa macro lenses?
this is an apu proccesor but it still has 8 cores and 8 threads <br><a href="https://www.costco.com/lenovo-flex-5-14%22-2-in-1-touchscreen-laptop---amd-ryzen-7-4700u---1080p.product.100579313.html">https://www.costco.com/lenovo-flex-5-14%22-2-in-1-touchscreen-laptop---amd-ryzen-7-4700u---1080p.product.100579313.html</a>
Imagine someone coming here after long and confused why linus is giving voiceover to the guy on the screen<br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=9m35s">9:35</a> our sponsor <a href="http://drop.com/">drop.com</a>, Linus&#39; smile says it



Really liked those close-up shots of the opened laptops
i have that HP laptop it works fabulously...!

In recent years specially after Ryzen launched the 3000 series Intel vs Amd has gone intense and we can see team blue is kinda loosing now and what wonders me the most is whta will happen after around 4-5 years anyhow it&#39;s good for us , the consumers new and new chips and graphics card means the old one are cheaper aka we are saving money big times kudos to them :)
Bought the Inspiron 5505 this week, i really love the Dell Latitude series but i just don&#39;t want to pay more money for much lesser performance. AMD is killing it here and not just that, having an AMD gpu is a must on Linux because you don&#39;t have the driver issues nvidia has and not the terrible GPU performance most intel chips have.
Geee, look at the clips teaser pic alone... how damn sexy is Linus?? 😋
I got an intel laptop from metabox and its quite good in CPU performance and gpu
AMD keeps ripping... 😁
Nice title change
That fade to black at the end that just left the HP logo. Kudos to the editor on that, it was cool.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m03s">6:03</a> made me think of something evil. Linus should hold a giveaway to win a cool laptop BUT that picture is custom engraved into the laptop case.  Win and lose simultaneously muahahaha.


No, i dont think i will.
Are you guys filming with a probe macro lens?
I wonder when would Glasswire get bought by other companey so we could stop seeing this ad?????
linus makes my day bright :)

compliments display, bashes hp for not using a larger one with a different aspect ratio lol
I am a Computer Engineering Student and I bought the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14 inches / IdeaPad Slim 5 14 inches (AMD Ryzen 7 4700U) and it was great. I got no problem using it.<br>For a premium laptop with a low price and great specs, I would say that AMD is greater than Intel (mostly the APU Power). In Intel, mostly of their premium Laptops were far more expensive (2x or greater more).<br>In short if you want a premium laptop with great specs for a low price. I would Recommend the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 14 inches / IdeaPad Slim 5 14 inches.
I am still rocking my beastly HP Pavilion from 2011 with i7 2670QM ,12 GB of RAM and cheap Sandisk 240 GB SSD ,super fast and reactive in normal daily use and without that AMD GPU bug it will even be better 😎👌
Now I feel bad for intel. AMD stop!!! intel is dead already
What&#39;s the use of a 13&quot; laptop with a touchscreen?
U GUYS got new MACRO lense??......
Gross. Barrel plug 😒
lenovo flex 5 with 16gb same cpu for $599 on amazon
like i get that laptops are portable, but how often do you take it somewhere? just build a desktop you have a smartphone.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m49s">0:49</a> no you literally can&#39;t block it instantly. you see it then you block it after it already sends packets, this is one of my biggest gripes with glassware.

Crys in Ryzen 3 3200u and 2009 MBP
Please don’t let intel die...
The cpu isn’t really top priority when buying a laptop. Finding a high end graphics card with good thermals is more important. The cpu is secondary. And also, it’s really hard to find a AMD equipped laptop with anything other than budget screens and graphics
how much would a type c charging port would increase the price. I don&#39;t understand some choices with laptops
Hey, you typing wrong. Bend your fingers more. It&#39;s faster. Trust me.
You can actually get the ryzen 4700u (8 core) version of the envy for 750 rn! It’s on sale on Best Buy!
Silicon baby
?? I always now but intel, I will send to work in maintenance for British Airways, the he IT guy there said always intel. Always done me right. Had AMD once years ago, early 2000. Big mistake. I will always buy intel. Interesting vid. Always learning. 😎👍
His hands are fat.
When a laptop is better than your 2k pc
I bought one of these for 500 bucks
Did it really say USD 0.00 at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m19s">4:19</a> ?<br>Typo?

&quot;This is my whole weeeekend&quot;
Should you even consider a laptop? <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>NOOOOOOOO!
BIggest issue with ryzen: not enough people using em. i wanna get a xps 13 but cant get a budget one with a ryzen. i want a r7 in more laptops plzzz
Amd just kickin them where it hurts the most...
Linus expecteda video from you about the best video editing and gaming laptop . Please try to make it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=3m57s">3:57</a> <br><br>&quot;they had us in the first half, I&#39;m not gonna lie&quot;
Long story short: Get a Ryzen laptop. You get much more performance for the same price as an Intel laptop, is more power efficient and has far less thermal problems


Im going to buy it in several years on secondhand market)

Linus: should you even consider a intel laptop?<br>XPS 15: yea boiiiii
1) now if it&#39;s possible to have r9 4900hs coupled with an rtx 2080 super (max q at least)???<br>2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m02s">6:02</a> for fuk sake linus
whoever made the BRoll for this video and camino video needs a raise
this video is kinda missing the point. It only covers two laptops and not even covers the average gamer-ish laptops that most people would buy. The cpus in this range would be : Ryzen 5 3550H,  Ryzen 7 3750H, I5 9300H, I5 10300H<br>35W vs 45W, amd output less heat and is more power-efficient overall, but intel performs better in gaming overall (averaging 12.5% more perf for the same GPU for a selection of 20 games). It also performs better in multi-threaded tasks. <br>Amd is close but this is propaganda at this point
AMD is just a piece of s*<b>*</b>
You know what they say about people with small hands... They have small hands what else would they say?
NEVER buy an AMD laptop because amd on laptops are pure trash i have a ryzen 7 2700U vega 10 8gb ram 1000gb hdd  and it can barely run minecraft on lowest settings and can&#39;t run any other games if u want more then 15 fps on the lowest settings and recentlly about 2 weeks ago my laptop started to run on 100% disk usage 100%cpu usage and 100% ram usage EVEN IN DESKTOP doeing nothing with no aplication opened  and i saw is task manager that system is using 50 to 70% of the cpu all the time and is also super slow at the same time idk why but is soo anoying that my always sounds like a jet taking off
I have an intel laptop: <br>I5 2450 <br>4gb ram <br>Intel graphics <br>500gb hdd <br>I feel ashamed
please gave me a gaming pc
What about thunderbolt 3 though?
Intel is cool
AMD on fx era Intel was such a bully. AMD on ryzen era <b>PUMP UP MUSIC</b>
Hp Envy is the worst laptop on this planet, people who have used it know it, the hinge fails after a few months, the battery life sucks, brightness still not that great, design has many flaws
Intel stockholders on suicide watch
someone&#39;s CLEARLY having fun with the probelense
mhm 800$, soon as linus talks about it it doubles in price
I thought it was ShortCircuit at first :)))
GIVE US MORE GRAPHHSS!!!
The real answer is: only if you get a great deal. I managed to get an i7-10750h + rtx2060 for 1k, while I do love amd, that&#39;s hard to beat
People really buy laptops and care? I don&#39;t get it
Is the ram upgradable or is it soldered on?
One word, Thunderbolt
I predict in the future he has so many items he will eventually giving away some♥️♥️♥️♥️
That ryzen 5 4500 envy often goes on sale for 549.99 at best buy. I work there and its fairly monthly/bi monthly
Wrong question. There is no choice between Intel and AMD. Because AMD IS UTTER GARBAGE, you cannot compare their USELESS TRASH CRAP against real CPUs like Intel.
How about should you even consider AMDs poor architecture and software after all the garbage software issues and BIOS written by toddlers.
Lol who else just watched a year old video and then watched this a loved the new into thing
What is the number one gaming laptop that you would recommend depending on both price and performance?
I hope that envy has dual channel ram. I got boned with my ryzen laptop, I didn&#39;t know it only had one ram slot when I bought it, so I had to put a 16gb low latency stick in it instead of 2x8gb -.- Lenovo fucked up with that single ram slot
Linus: WHAT???!!!!!!<br>ME: Wait WHAT?!!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂
Love the new close up shots 😍👌 keep it up guys!
Yeah because if I like the laptop and its only offered with Intel, I&#39;m gonna go with it as much as I wish they had choice (looking at you thinkpad x1)
Too bad HP laptop batteries swell and pop like popcorn
Yo Linus there is a envy x360 15 inch

No
My 10 year old laptop is an AMD laptop
LTT only recommending 8 gigs of RAM?
Woah is that a new intro
Yes because literally you cannot get a G14 for under 2300 usd in my country... to point that into perspective you could buy a Strix with a  2070 for less, IN THE SAME COUNTRY ?!
Does it get to 16gb of ram?
Laughs in HONOR Magicbook 14&quot; (Same configuration, 550$)
if you want intel for laptops, go for apple.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>oh wait.
That segway was hilarious. Loved it.
I watched this and then remembered I use a 100 dollar laptop
Linus: Says something very positive about AMD<br>Intel: Add more cores!!!






Touch screen or just pen only?
HP offers regular sales on this model and the R7 4700u model with 16GB ram and 512gb SSD was available at $900 which was a steal IMO. That sub 3 lb notebook can do some real heavy lifting, even basic 4K editing work which was unthinkable b4 Ryzen 4000 Renoir.
If you&#39;re going to take macro shots, you should collect the dust beforehand. It doesn&#39;t do the quality shots justice.
Imagine this with the upcoming 7nm rtx 3000 cards... The. It will be one of the best gaming ultrabooks, with still good battery life and better performance
Does Linus speak french?
U guys don&#39;t take Sundays off?
Damn I was going to get this laptop but was waiting for more sales later this year but everyone is probably going to get one after seeing this video so there probably won&#39;t be any sales. :(
you guys shod look at lenovos new laptops they got AMD pro .... a new line up of AMD CUPs that have 8c/16t and 6c/12t in the 4000 U
To save you 10 mins, the answer for the title is no.
What do you think of the ProBook-Series like the HP Probook 445 G7? It is a laptop of cause, but the IO is really great (kills the envy series if you asked me... and it has Hello at a compareable price)<br>Yes it is a laptop not a convertible, but for instance it has ethernet built in... &quot;oh USB A is in it?&quot; Yep, but even better: Full Blown ethernet especially useful if you are presenting at a company which can not give you a Wifi password... clip it in and ready to go.
my laptop has an amd cpu and gpu i am intel and nvidia free
I have been putting off replacing my sorely aged Asus Pro  laptop  for an AMD.  I think the one I want is coming soon.... This one ticks several boxes but not all.
Try out a laptop in BestBuy or Costco before buying? What is this not 2020 anymore?
5 years ago: Intel RULES THE WORLD!!<br>Now: Should the thought of buying an Intel device even be worth the energy it takes to have it enter your mind for consideration?



This video came out a day after I bought an Intel based laptop...
wow that laptop is so nic my laptop is so bad
Congratulations on the new lens, Brandon.
I got a Thinkpad A485. The trackpad is really bad. So bad that it just stops working and requires a restart. Why can&#39;t we can an AMD laptop without trash trackpads?
Just saw a linus pulseway commercial.
You guys are really enjoying playing with that new macro lens huh
At this Point AMD is trolling Intel!!😂
Yes if your on a budget
I&#39;ve been looking at this for a while now. Wish it was available in my country.
Almost looks like a conspiracy at this point how Laptop makers are deliberately keeping AMD out of top tier segments!
so it seems like the recommended config has been removed or has had the price change.....
I love ryzen my first system that can game in a r5 3500U and im hella satisfied with it
Can you run DeVinci Resolve or Adobe Premier on it?
hi
No, it&#39;s a laptop
I have the previous one, Envy x360 with Ryzen 3 3300U and 8 Gb (the 15.6 variant). It&#39;s absolute garbage I cannot recommend to anyone, it&#39;s slow, Vega 3 leaves only 5.9 Gb of ram and you can&#39;t adjust this in the BIOS, the battery life is atrocious, it&#39;s heavy (2+ kg), the display is 6-bit colorless garbage, the touch screen, and the 360 rotation is absolutely pointless marketing feature. If Linus recommends the follow-up I&#39;d be cautious about listening to him.<br>It was 100% my fault that I bought a piece of shit, only later I found some good alternatives with the same or better specs but even cheaper (from Asus and Lenovo). Fuck HP.
😔 my dad left me at Costco.    he was tooo preoccupied trying those switches   that was 1992.   pls decide dad
Only reason I went intel for my laptop is that amd doesn&#39;t offer anything better than a 2060.
Is there gonna be a review of the XPS 15 &amp; 17?? <br>I really want to get an XPS 17 but idk
They should check out what lenovo has been pumping for the budget category
Do I need a 3:2 display to watch 2:1 content?

im surprised they didn&#39;t titled it as Envy review. it would surely get alot more views since a lot of people who dont watch LTT are interested in it.
Yes
I&#39;m not a laptop user so excuse my naivety, but why would you want <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> or 3:2 over 16:9 on a laptop display?
in my opinion i think intel is shit. all their laptops even 300+ dollar ones have shitty specs. imo i think you should get more bang for your buck nowadays cus prices haven&#39;t changed for years.
Man... 2020 is a really bad year for Intel, AMD destroying them and Apple saying &quot;screw you we gonna make our own CPUs&quot;.
Why did Linus change his upload time
My wife who works for HP said that HP is still riding Intel&#39;s d*ck, like come on? When are they gonna realize that AMD is the future? This is why Lenovo is winning with their cheaply mad laptops.
XPS 13/15 with AMD CPUs, please!!!!
The g14 r9 is 2600 USD in my country, but just thinking about an amd 4000 razer blade stealth + gtx give me goosebumps.
Amd: i dont care what universe your from thats gotta hurt
WHY ARE YOU GUYS UPLOADING 3 HOURS EARLY?!?!?! I really just want to know.
I actually got this laptop for college a week or two ago. This thing is FAST for its price. I am really amazed with this thing. It really punches above its weight class. The only problem I am having with it is that it seems to have a glitch with the speaker which I can only hear in silent rooms. I have done everything to fix that but nothing worked, however, I really would recommend it regardless. It&#39;s incredible. Especially an incredible first laptop.<br><br>I have the 15 inch model. It has a bit less battery life but it EASILY lasts me the whole day watching youtube.
Linus : &quot;not gona comapre it to the xps13&quot;<br>Linus too : <b>proceeds to compare it to xps 13 anyways</b>
I own one of these with the r7 8core and its incredibly capable even for gaming, the only oversight is that you cant wake it up if its in tablet mode unless you go back to laptop mode bc the  keyboard (where the power button is placed) is locked out so you dont accidentally type while handling it. If you have the pen paired to it over bluetooth you can wake it up using the pen buttons but its still somewhat annoying.









uhhh did i just
AMD is cool
I&#39;m very curious to see what AMD releases to the PC market, especially laptops once the next gen consoles actually start shipping.<br><br>Big Navi, Ultimate Navi,  RDNA2.......waiting
Banana for scale? Cancel this video pls
Best ssd
HP has incredible product names.<br>Intel: Spectre, like a ghost from past<br>AMD: Envy of all intel laptops









In chile cost 1200 usd
I was literally looking at this computer yesterday and I was searching for an ltt review and there wasn’t one. I just checked again and there it was.
Intel is becoming that guy in processors what internet explorer became in browsers
I&#39;ve never been this early to a video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m24s">6:24</a> I was unaware of some laptop makers recently going to taller aspect ratios, but I welcome this trend. As someone who still uses a Chromebook Pixel 2015 with a 3:2 aspect ratio, and treasures it on account of it&#39;s display (13&quot; 2560x1700 3:2 display with excellent color) and battery life (12hr, which was harder to find 5 years ago), I&#39;m glad we&#39;re FINALLY seeing some other devices with such aspect ratios again. Seems like the Chromebook Pixel 2015 was a good 5 years ahead of it&#39;s time in some ways.








My only wish is that it comes to indian market soon. Asus zephrus never even made to market yet
Well I would love to have a thread ripper in my Area 51M R2, but there&#39;s no other choice
Weird, Linus always complains about webcam quality but not even a mention
give me that but a bit thicker (I wanna have my bluray drive and HDD in there, and you can make the battery bigger etc) and in 17 inches. also remove &quot;premium&quot; bs for getting cheaper
I really, really hope that laptop manufacturers stop this crap of 16:9. 3:2 is ideal for 13.3 and 13.9.
Review the nitro 5 (2020)

Still waiting for an AMD laptop with a 2070 or a 2080 super.... why is this not a regular topic in tech YouTube channels?
Tip number 1: Have money.
Hewlett Packard was allways crap computers back in the day looks like they have come along way and stepped up there game
Which processor should I used Intel or amd??
I loved that bannana for scale
Yeat
TL;DR: no, ryzen &gt; intel
This is my wholllle weekend
A good Hp laptop, nah.
I&#39;m really interested, however, thunderbolt always worked for me to connect a e-GPU. How does this platform work with e-GPU?
I wish amd laptops can feature higher end gpus like the 2080 siper max q or 2070 super max q
tbh for me i watch these videos because i&#39;m really a fan of high-tech stuff, also this dude is funny, but at the end of the day i feel like i&#39;m just watching stuff from the feature, even inn this case with this &quot;cheap price&quot; there&#39;s no way i can afford any of the things he shows up until &quot;maybe&quot; 2-3 years from now
As much as I love AMD, I still want intel to survive. Embrace the competition

I have to unsubscribe after this vid, wait I already did ...
Are all your browser workloads on <a href="http://lttstore.com/">lttstore.com</a> OR WHAT
Intel: is doing good<br>AMD:<br><br>I&#39;m about to end this man&#39;s whole career.


My AMD laptop was so slow I had to switch from Windows to Lubuntu. Although I much prefer Linux to Windows, I shouldn&#39;t have to change operating systems to get my system to even open a web browser. For god sake buy Intel.
Dunno about you but i got the favoritism
I think you should consider an ARM Macbook
Answer...... No
Lol - the CHEAPEST Spectre x360 I could find in Europe is a cool 1700$ ... your prices are generally useless for anyone not living in the US
Not good representations of either of the cpus, those can be configured with higher pl1 and pl2 if the thermal designs would&#39;ve been better, like Ideapad S540 13&#39;s design which maintains 37W on the Ryzen 7 4800U.
Looks like the camera crew is really liking those new macro lenses. Sick shots, guys.
But I&#39;m waiting for the Ryzen XPS 2021.<br><b>Linus:speaking of 2021,did you know chances that your computer getting hacked increases every year...that&#39;s why get a VPN ....with code LTT to get 20%off</b>

The only major problem is HP which has poor tech support, in the last 15 years of my IT experience I&#39;ve yet to be impressed with a single call to HP to get support or hardware replacement.  Long as you don&#39;t need to call them it could be good hardware.
XPS 15 9500 full review when please?
Did Linus buy a probe lens??
A BANANA FOR SCALE???!!! CAN&#39;T THAT GET YOU CANCELLED?

Spectre X360 with AMD CPUs when?
Are they flexing a Probe lens?
I feel really uncomfortable using MacBook Pro 15 (late 2013) while watching a review of this small little beast.<br><br>Don’t get me wrong: my laptop does the work great in Final Cut Pro, Xcode and Ableton Live but watching what’s new in laptop manufacturing industry in 2020 really blows my mind. Maybe I’ll try to sell my piece of half eaten Apple, and buy this...

Can you do a review on the Nuraphone headphones please?
What laptop comes with only 8gb ram?
I still regret getting a laptop for gaming
Although I love my xps 13, I wish it was as affordable as laptops with amd.
Intel got away with selling the i7 7700K as a top tier desktop CPU, just to sell it again 3 years later as an i3 with almost no technological advancements whatsoever. <br><br>They ain’t gonna get away this time
TL;DR: No*<br>-<br>Well for the same other spec&#39;s you shouldn&#39;t consider Intel, but considering AMD still doesn&#39;t have laptops with GPUs above a 2060, if need something beyond a 2060 you are stuck unfortunately. There are really decent AMD laptops, so I don&#39;t think you will be lacking for build quality etc to any significant degree with the right choice, but them lacking highend GPUs is a big hit.
ha. i got my laptop as a steal. maybe not the best processer, but 1 tb hardirve, and 124 gb ssd,  but most importantly 16 gb ram
Buy the amd
Short answer : No
Is the sticker pack really free?<br><br><br><br>I know its an editing error but still.
Fortnite vids plz
Great review! I personally prefer 16/9 because I watch movies!
I have the predecessor, and I really like it.<br>My only complaint is that it is 1080p and I would be willing to pay up for a 1440p display, for better handwriting.<br>In my hands it is more of a overlyexpensive notebook. <br>But it is a really decent one and I like how well it runs. I never felt of it as slow. <br>The battery is still decent nearly a year in. <br>I played games occasionally, nothing fancy, but it can run small games like TFT or a cardgame. <br>If you want a close to premium notebook for under 800 bucks. You came to the right place.<br>There are also occasionally deals on it too.
The thermals arent an argument the cpus are built to run at 100C and then throttle to get the maximum performence out of it. It would be a good idea to overclock the ryzen because its not throtteling.
If intel continue like this, you’ll need a car radiator for their cpu, now I understand why Apple drop them
I had a Hp Envy &quot;ultrabook&quot; a few years ago.<br>It was pure garbage and windows 10 was never a thing thanks to hp not releasing updated drivers while the current drivers didn&#39;t even work great on the shipped windows 8 or also supported windows 7.<br>Never again.<br>Saved an old Asus laptop from 2006, drivers for windows xp/vista still work perfectly in windows 10.
&quot;Should you Even CONSIDER an Intel Laptop?&quot; &quot;EHHHHHHHH!. Unless your an AMD Brand Loyalist&quot;
Still rocking my i5 7th gen!
Damn, was about to buy the xps 13 but now i want amd...
so no audio review? :(
Would NEVER consider an AMD Laptop. Sorry just junk.
I&#39;ve seen the Radeon Vega version of the Ryzen 5 model at a convenient  price. Is there any reason to prefer a Radeon over an Nvidia today? What I hated about the Envy in comparison with the Spectre is the different sub-models available by country, you know HP Envy X360 -&quot;acxxxxx/arxxxx&quot; noticeable by the end of the model number. Some of them come without pen support for example, it&#39;s annoying to live where limited models like those are sold.
Let&#39;s be practical here and not be completely blown by AMD CPUs,<br>What are you really gonna do in a machine like this, the answer is probably web surfing and mostly as a Netflix device.<br>My point is that more power is nice to have, but you can&#39;t use it in device like this, any Intel Based device like this can do the same job and with a GREAT Reliably of Intel chips i think Intel devices are still considerable to buy for now until some miracle is descovered which can solve thermal issues.
Linus when is Rog reboot 2020

I see you guys got a macro probe, Brandon must be happy
Wait so we are comparing a 8 core laptop with dedicated graphics to a intel ultra book with no dedicated graphics? 🧐


Is that Yvonne&#39;s brother
Intel mobile cpu naming schemes are the biggest cancer ever.
Haha, I just bought this laptop 3 days ago (HP X360)!! This is quite reassuring. Only difference is mine is a 15&quot; screen.
No. <br>Shortest video!
should you buy a cheap cpu with a gtx 1050Ti or a AMD Ryzen 5 3600x??

How unfortunate to have an Intel laptop called Spectre
No
Yeah... but does it run Crysis?
Can you make a video about a world record pc with 128 cores
The better power efficiency has to be one of the highlights. You get better performance while consuming less power.
Well we sasquatches don&#39;t really think about stuff like that<br>We pretty much just have to take what we can get, so just whatever the campers leave behind
Nice close-up shots. How are they made?
I have lenovo g500 with 2gb amd graphic card ..and my laptop works slow ..its ram is 4gb...sometimes i got angry and i want to break my laptop ...while watch ur videos i calm myself...hahah my laptop is soo dumb
Desktop pricing for thermal throttling and crippled CPU/GPU choices because... intel, I don&#39;t know why the market for laptops exists anymore, phones are cheaper and do the same job in 2020.
It was very important for Massdrop to change it&#39;s name to <a href="http://drop.com/">Drop.com</a>, so that we could have Linus read a sponsor spot for a sponsor called &quot;<a href="http://drop.com/">Drop.com</a>&quot;. Since Linus invented dropping things, he should get royalties for the use of that name.

any thoughts about OMEN 2020
For the 1st time I can actually afford something Linus is reviewing &amp; funny enough, I&#39;m looking at getting a laptop &amp; this would be in my budget!



Confused Linus: What&#39;s a segue?<br><br><i>does a segue</i>
THIS is mah whooooole weekend!
Can you guys do the HP gaming laptops, the omen 17
Hopefully we see more Ryzen CPUs in the flagship laptops of companies. So no need to settle for intel based laptops just because they are partnered with the better GPU and better features.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=4m21s">4:21</a>    no because it is hp
Link to your sticker pack? Can&#39;t find it on the LTT store
another robot animated linus voice -_-
he forgot to tell the segway for hp🤣

Trying to type this comment on my Intel MacBook, but it&#39;s 100c Degrees under the 4,5,6,R,T,Y keys, and it&#39;s burning my fingers..
Short answer : Maybe<br>Long answer : See video.
sees good laptop, 16:9 🤢
Idk what Linus is smoking but I wouldn&#39;t not want a laptop that isn&#39;t something near 16:9. I could do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=16m10s">16:10</a> but stuff like 3:5 is wack.
Ive recently been looking for a laptop so this is perfect timing
I prefer Dell in place off HP also with company support
i got the envy in 15 inches and 16gb of ram, since you can’t upgrade it and i wanted to have a good amount for the future. If anyone needs a laptop thats not gonna break the bank but has good performance, i couldn’t recommend this thing more. I use it for music production, but even gaming with friends casually is not an issue at all.
Don&#39;t buy this laptop or anything from HP!<br>I got the 15&quot; version recently and it had many problems, so I am attempting to return it. First, there was a BIOS bug that caused it to overheat whenever it was shut. A few weeks later, a fix was released. Also, the speakers make a high irregular noise whenever a video, online or offline, is paused, or even if Windows makes a noise. Lastly, the touchpad started separating from the frame. All of these things happened less than a month after I got it. The customer service is also terrible. I have called about 15 times to return it, starting less than a week after I got the product, and everybody agreed on a return. None of them sent a return label and I was delayed until the 30-day return period was over to get anywhere. Then, they tried to deny a refund because it was over the 30-day period. I would not recommend buying this laptop or any other laptop from HP.






Currently out of stock but it&#39;s 600 bucks at us Costco
Wow, looks like my next Windows laptop will have an AMD processor, they have been consistently impressive lately.

I have an Acer Nitro V, oh man that Ryzen 5 3xxx it has so snappy.
Thunderbolt is basically the only reason to get Intel right now and USB4 will resolve that
Linus pulseway ads looks good
Me just buy laptop last year: <b>cried in intel 4 core i5</b>

Do you think Mac will ever have AMD processors?

Man and I was considering a new gaming laptop with Intel, but I might have to stick with ryzen.
Man these new macro shots look sick
At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=8m41s">8:41</a> he talks about them killing there flagship lineup. Well they could be doing this as a test to see how there customers feel about Ryzen 4000 mobile. Just thought I might put this out there.
Hey linus can you build a $500 pc
Hp, just get Freaking Real, Get AMD 4000 series in your high-end models.<br>Edit. Perhaps they don&#39;t do that because of the Thunderbolt 3 factor
i would get this laptop but they mark up the price in the uk for that model all the way up to £850 and when you convert that into dolars its $1,072!!
I am still using my intel hd 400 graphics. Please send me a GTX 1660. I bet you must be having a lot of money.
hey i didnt even realize i was early until i finished watching the video

😂😂😂 Linus bro you read my mind, I was looking for new laptop &amp; I found 3 great for price laptops. One of these is AMD Ryzen5 powered HP envy, I hoped you make a video about it &amp; here you are. What&#39;s more interesting is my other 2 shortlisted laptops are acer swift 3 with AMD Ryzen7 &amp; Asus Zenbook 14 with AMD Ryzen5.
just got the acer swift 3 for a family member, except the keyboard (which is okay) its a awesome little laptop. thin and light enough to call &quot;ultrabook&quot;
My mom&#39;s gonna love this laptop omg


All I fear is AMD making their processors cost more in future just like intel is increasing the money.<br>The amount of performance AMD gives its impossible they won&#39;t increase prices.<br>Just like we saw with One Plus devices.

Short answer: NO!
I&#39;m glad Lenovo knows that the Flex 14 has poor build quality by calling it the Flex. The Deck Flex...
Short Answer: No.<br><br><br>Long answer: No fucking chance in hell
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=6m04s">6:04</a> im calling fbi
About time HP starts getting recognition.
Linus are y&#39;all gonna talk about the new Lenovo Flex 5? I&#39;m rocking one and it is such a great little machine.
Thank you, we do need more exposure on amd laptops, so we get them in higher end SKUs.<br><br>Nice to know you&#39;re doing the Swift 3 as well. Thannks :)
Me on PowerPC iBook:<br><b>AMATEURS.</b>



Why do I buy Intel laptops? Well I can get an I7 9750H with an RTX 2060 for 999$ while an R7 4800H with an RTX 2060 Max-Q costs 1499$, easy choice because I&#39;m not a fanboy
If only there were laptops with AMD CPUs that actually had high end GPUs
Should you even consider an Intel Laptop? Simple question, simple answer, NO!
Apple be like, “ Our MacBooks with Apple Silicon will now be able to run Candy Crush”<br><br>Price: 1499 bucks
Okay, these super macro shots looks awesome.

personally i&#39;d never get an intel chipped laptop, honestly. AMD just offers so much better for the same price.
Oh don&#39;t mind me.I&#39;m still waiting for something that&#39;ll suit my budget friendly ass🤷

Yes. You should consider Intel because you be upgrading for a long time because it was so damn expensive
new intro. POG!
I mean my i3 carried me for a year and a half so I don&#39;t mind

My inner nerd comes out when I watch your videos
Classic click bate
I like how Alex is the mandatory big hands typing commentator on laptop videos.
I have a 8th gen i7 envy x360 15&quot;. Its a great design but for me internals are poor. The ssd was only sata, luckily the slot was NVME so could upgrade. The thermal compound is poor with some better was able to not max the thermals but then found the main problem. The laptop is power limited, only has 65w power brick with an i7 and nvidia 150mx graphics. The cpu is rated 25w but normally sits around 10w and 70c.

Serious question from me, a non-gamer.  Wouldn&#39;t gamers prefer to have an ethernet port instead of having to use a dongle and tying up one of the USB ports? <br><br>I tend to believe that laptop makers have gone well past the point of &quot;sleek design&quot; and are solidly into the &quot;function dramatically trailing form&quot;.  I&#39;d much rather have a laptop that is<br>half an inch thicker and weighs a pound or two more if it means I can easily replace components, batteries, etc and have a full host of ports.
Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 with the 4500U unbeatable at this price
You could say that this laptop is pretty Ryzen.
I&#39;m so glad that AMD bounced back and showed Intel what daddy means. I had thought about building a PC with Bulldozer way back then to support the little guy but couldn&#39;t justify it considering the performance difference. My next PC build will definitely be AMD.

GUYS HELP INTEL OR AMD??
Did he say the 104** was 10nm? Pretty sure it is still 14, isn&#39;t it?
I heard that Intel co-owns a lot of premium laptop brands such as XPS, Spectre, and X1 Carbon, so they can&#39;t put an AMD CPU in those.

They are great for gaming. Run wayyyy too hot.
Amd started out rebranding intel CPU’s

K.O.for Intel. AMD wins.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU&amp;t=0m26s">0:26</a> that laptop spinning thing, just loved it 💗



Are AMD laptops still more likely to have an actual graphics card while Intel laptops are more likely to use on-board video?
This video took so long to load because I have garbage data
Oh how far we&#39;ve come and I love it.
<b>“Herbert Placard”</b> is the Intro Title of this video.
Because most people don’t look at laptops that cost £1000+. Most of us look at the previous gens on deals.

Almost the first to comment
Let&#39;s just accept it. AMD is better in every way.
When your so earlier it’s not out long enough to finish the video
Okay that was a dope segway, didn&#39;t see it coming.
No
AMD can’t slow down. Their overall system cost for the average gamer is actually higher than intel’s if you factor the higher MB cost, and higher ram cost (because you need better ram for AMD)
Only Thing I miss on AMD Laptops is the thunderbolt 3 port
People seeing this comment haven’t even watched the full video yet
Yes, consider it
<b>TEAMRED</b>
Linus: says good things about a product<br>Company: yeah, let&#39;s price it up
























The Answer is yes you should<br>If you are in a country like India where both the prices of AMD and Intel laptops are same

Aye Linus, My laptop is wrecked and im going back to college in August/September in computer engineering, can you do a review of laptop for coding  when you can, thanks bruddah.

Bro I feel like people just auto dislike the video Like the video is 10 minutes and people already disliked it 3 minutes after it has been posted like wtf

Well, Intel is trying to get companies to gimp the variants of their laptops that contain AMD chips. Sure loser much?

Doesnt matter, next year oems will still pick intel for whatever reason
how do you see this s fast 81th

watching this on an intel i7 8750H laptop with a GTX 1060 and I&#39;m laughing

Not to brag, but I&#39;m watching this on my Intel laptop :)

In the beginning the laptop was upside down. And I (an intellectual) thought that there is a brand called <b>dq</b>






Never heard of HP Envy&#39;s for quite a year
2 dislikes in 2 minutes???? Haters, STOP THAT!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Just kidding 😅🤣
AMD is more value for money, although in many cases intel just gets through with a close margin

Normally which laptop batter in Hp and lenovo ThinkPad?

Hey Mathew...what would you recommend between i5 12th gen vs ryzen 7 6800h

I got the i5 version with fhd 400 nits display…2 days ago! I want more battery life being a PhD student so I got the fhd version!


Would you buy this over a lenovo yoga 6?

People should stop saying that using plastic reclaimed from the ocean helps &quot;save the planet&quot;. The amount of reclaimed plastic used on these laptops is tiny compared to what is produced daily. While I&#39;m all for manufacturers doing this, the marketing claim that it&#39;s &quot;saving&quot; the planet lulls certain people into thinking that they should still buy a laptop every year. At most, it&#39;s &quot;mitigating damage already done&quot;

I&#39;ve been waiting a while for the Space Blue to be available. The silver is blah. C&#39;mon HP. Make the Space Blue available in the US already!


Hellooo, i want to take your opinion on something. I&#39;ve been searching for a laptop for 2 months now. I want something good that will last for a long time, i&#39;ll be programming, gaming a little bit, might get into video editing too.<br>I was conviced with the lenovo legion 5i pro until i watched your hp envy 16 review.<br>I&#39;m searching for a 16&quot; 16 :10 laptop, and right now i have the envy 16 i7 12700H, 3060, 16GB ram, 1TB storage with the oled screen (only option available) in my cart :p and i&#39;m thinking about buying it this week (before the hp autumn sales end) i can get it for about 1600€ currently, the 5i pro is for like 2k+€ for the same specs.<br>Am i losing alot by going for the envy 16 ? Do you have any suggestions of a good, not so expensive 16&quot; laptop with similar specs? Also i&#39;m not very comfortable with the oled screen, since if i&#39;ll be programing there will be lots of static parts on the screen. Should i be worried about screen burn in ?


He Mathew, great review!<br>Would you recommend this over the pavilion 14 plus?<br>I saw the pavilion review and I was sold, the amazing specs, screen and the low price all made it perfect but I wonder if paying extra for the envy is going to offer better quality? thanks!





👍👍👍👍

Spectre x360 16 please.

I need a comparison between these HP VS THE Lenovo thinkpad 13z, if you can make a top 10 or top 5 of best 13/14 laptop of 2022 will be great !

I am still not sold on these 360 devices as I feel as a tablet it is not a great experience, though obviously better than nothing. There are some good 360 choices, but I still think that the Galaxy Book 2 Pro 360 is the best choice in this category due to Samsung&#39;s ecosystem and the s-pen integration. Also, having launched sometime ago, there are some great deals that take it done by 33%. Though HP and others do have their deals as well.




they send you guys to review the good products but they won&#39;t have it in their website to order asap, just jokers. this color isn&#39;t even available on their site. and it has hinges issues


text for laptop&#39;s specs is very small.



Hello There, I shortlisted 2 laptops for me, HP Pavilion Plus I7 12700H(OLED) &amp; HP Envy 13.3 I7 1250U(OLED). Which is better buy overall? My requirements are: For normal daily use, Running various softwares, Research, Playing games sometimes, Must have great display, Good touchpad &amp; keyboard, Durability &amp; Reliability. I know Pavilion Plus has better CPU but I don&#39;t think there will be much difference in real life performance &amp; It doesn&#39;t have Thunderbolt ports, After the discount price difference is very less &amp; both are comfortably under my budget. So should I buy Envy over Pavilion Plus?Another short question is, Should I slightly increase my budget &amp; buy Spectre 13.5 I7 1255U(OLED)? Value for money is most important for me, So is it really worth to spend almost 400$ extra(in my country this is the price difference)for Spectre over Envy &amp; Pavilion Plus? ( I am fine with just little inferior quality &amp; few less features)



Ideapad 5 pro review please

Love the surge of these E4 OLED panel on many Windows laptop lately. It easily increases display quality aspect of modern laptops as a whole which used to be stale progression in the past years especially compared to smartphone industry ...


Hi Matthew,<br>How about performance in game? I am curious about that. For some kind of gaming on the go. 😁


-Nice laptop. Great balance between price and specs.<br><br>-May I ask which was the tool kit you were using at the end of the video? I&#39;m trying to find a proper screwdriver to open my thinkpad without damaging the screws




😍😍😍😍😍

Hey Matthew, you can checkout Asus Vivobook 14
Does somebody has experience about fan noise? Is it the same awful as Lenovo Yoga?
I got the non-touchscreen model because this one didn&#39;t support 16 gb of ram out of the box but now I kind of wish I got it so I can do math digitally which would be useful for me at least.
I didnt have a pen with mine. I have the 15&quot;
The &quot;hi!&quot; Got me wanting to buy this lol
Question: I&#39;m an animation student who needs a replacement for my dying Surface Book 3. It&#39;s great for the software I need - Autodesk Maya, Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Toon Boom. The problem is that it&#39;s not only expensive, but it&#39;s bulky and awkward to carry around. I need a cheaper, lighter alternative which has just as strong a graphics card and performance. Would this be suitable for what I need?
Recently got the &#39;22 Yoga 6 (13.3&quot; 1920x1200 Touch 2-in-1 Laptop Ryzen 7 5700U 16GB RAM 512GB SSD 300 nits) for less than $650. I actually got 2, one each for my twins for their school and as budding artists. I brought this up because Yoga 6 is considered in the same class as this HP 13&quot;. Wondering if you could do a review on this model or at least assess its ability for the very young artist just starting out (my daughter loves to draw on my Samsung Note on its incredible Super AMOLED screen). No pen is included with the laptop but it is pen capable, so I&#39;m considering the Wacom Bamboo Plus for its tilt capability unless there is a better alternative that you can suggest. Also, what constitutes a good drawing tablet besides raw power and pen quality? Do the touchscreen and its responsiveness come into play? Or are they pretty on par with one another? Thanks in advance!
Which Painting App is he using any clue ? Could anyone please tell ??
<b>I hate this thing.</b> I had the 15 Inch. It is very underpowered, for the price. The screen got a little scratched with my $100 Bamboo Ink Plus. Which also broke. So I’m gonna sell mine, and buy the <b>HP Chromebook X2 11.</b>
Are 2 in 1 laptops that good for digital art? Im thinking of getting one for work and illustration
Can I use the keyboard while drawing in the 360 degree mode ..cause you know..photoshop work needs shortcuts
Work in Windows 11 and fingerprint or Windows hello
exactly what i am currently researching - need a touchscreen comp for some drawing, and running blender 3d for grease pencil animation, plus it needs to handle video production (also done with blender). i had hp x360 once, but i didn&#39;t have digiPencil. overall, i was happy with hp, it run linux just fine. thx for sharing, have fun, aum

Do the Huawei Matepad Pro 👌
I have the 15inch and it is absolutely amazing! I have the 16gb ram model and it can handle literally anything!

does it come with a pen when you buy it?
Can you upgrade the ram and ssd storage?
Kind of wish you covered a few more of their laptops, I&#39;m needing a new one, and I&#39;m wanting to just go ahead and get one to draw on too, but I&#39;m not sure what to go for
Can this be used for work and simple audio editing?
You Over focused on the pen and drawing
what camera  are you  filming with ? ?
Samsung S7+
Pens with batteries. How stupid.
Thank you for your video. You even give a suggestion that fit with the laptop.
just got one, honestly, experience is nothing compared to mbp but mbp is too expensive nowadays but it is still a very productive experience and quite a great laptop. but the pen is really bad. if you wanna use pen , get the ipad or wacom 16. if office use, the 16gb ram, ryzen 7 is a beast but the usb port is so tight, scratching my pendrive......
My first ever laptop passée on from my mum and I’m so grateful for it!!
Hi Brad, did you review the Acer Spin 5?
Got this exact laptop from Best Buy and the pen was not included. That&#39;s a bit disappointing.
Is this laptop good for heavy task for data scientist???
Which software are u using
Does it work better with the re-chargeable Pencil?
This computer also used for Digital Ink and Paint.
"Honestly, this Envy x360 is the worst laptop i&#39;ve had in all 7 of them. 
<br>It is getting super hot while playing anything, even low spec games. 
<br>Sometimes it is freezing for 1-2 sec and it gets back to normal afterwards.
<br>The cooler is SUPER noisy even while browsing, sometimes for no reason.
<br>And now, after ~8 months of usage, THE DISPLAY IS STARTING TO GET OUT OF IT&#39;S &quot;CASE&quot; for some reason. Have to mention i don&#39;t even move him from the desk.<br><br>
<br>
<br>I&#39;m still wondering what else could broke soon in this &quot;machine&quot;. At least it looks good, lol."
I can just look at this laptop. My budget is very limited and this can’t go on my list. But if I would have a bigger budget I would definitely buy it.
Power button on keyboard - idiotic idea
Is that good for video editing?
I was just about to drop the money on the bigger ryzen 360, but I found an incredible deal on a Lenovo flex 14 for 300 dollars less.
what about the HP Pavillion x360? its in the sme price range and I&#39;v heard that the pen and drawing expirience even beats the spectre series.
Thanks to!
tell me pleace  the model  pencil for this laptop. recgarge
When you flip it to the tablet mode, how to trigger the shortcuts? I meant, like the de-select or anything else? Or should you do that manually?
I got hp envy x360 laptop 13-ay0004ur. Which is the best pen to use ?
is pen sensitivity better on the Samsung book pro?
Should I buy this ...... because I really want to animate on Photoshop or is there any better one than this ...my now laptop is only 4gb ram i3 intel and slow now
did u do one for HP Elite Folio?
Does the pen stick to the side if the laptop?
Lol i saw some post on facebook they sell this laptop for only 6000 Philippine peso!HAHAHAH🤣
How the price here in my country is 1050 dollers?
Wich version do I have? mine doesn&#39;t have fingerprint scanner and the on/off switch is a silver key on the left side?
What is the name of the drawing application?
Can you please review the Lenovo flex 5 4300u model? The 4gb version retails for 380 bucks i guess. Seems like a good option for drawing in windows
Love HP Envy laptops they are so beautiful and very good ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍
no ram upgrade btw
Can&#39;t wait for the Specter x360 review
why dont you try reviewing asus rog flow x13?
what software is he using for illustration?
Dose the hp envy pen have pressure sensitivity for drawing?
The envy in 2021 is a decent little daily driver laptop that can play some games, alot of older ones.... But if you use it as a tablet it goes from decent to pretty damn powerful
Hey Brad plz review lenovo flex 5
I just bought mine and it didn’t come with the pen!! 😡😡😡
Wow I want this lolz but I could only get a 200$ one
I regret buying this laptop tbh
waiting patiently for asus flow x13 review 👉👈
I already had a surface pro 3 pen and it works great with this computer. 👍
Is there a link?
Wait why did mine not come with a drawing pen?
Hinges break yet? They will, or at least my last 3 did. Buy a lap top not a flippy screen - trust me....
how about touchscreen? Is it good as tablet screen? and about the touchpen?
pen works just fine for me though... yes it&#39;s a pen not an apple pencil I guess
can you play genshin impact on this?
I was checking different channels for this laptop about drawing...and I got your channel..awsm
Hey Brad idk if you&#39;ll ever see this but i was wondering this laptop would be great for 2D animation? have u tried making animation with it and what were ur experiences like?
Assuming this envy laptop made from the same material (i got mine on 2017), in the long run, the screen starts to bend overtime and you can’t close the laptop properly. When you’re using it in tablet form, it overheats quite fast on your lap…<br>And the rubbery thingy on the base, due to the heat, it starts to peel off eventually and it looks more ugly with the bent screen 😅<br><br>But overall, hp envy performance is great especially for note-taking and light sketching, occasionally for valorant (strangely it doesnt overheat during gaming lol). Maybe i just dont take care of it properly hence these odd issues where the screen starts to bend and compromise the aesthetic look lol.
make a video on how to set up the pen
Is it true that HP AMD or HP AMD Ryzen consumes &gt;2GB of RAM for system usage. In my case a 16GB laptop shows only 13.9GB? HP support <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hpsupport">#hpsupport</a> @hpsupport wasnt very helpful giving a proper reason or documentation. Is this true on other HP AMDs or AMDs or .. ?

Please try lenovo products ❤️
Please do review for ROG Flow x13
Hmmmm regular glove with 3 fingers cut-off &amp; presto it&#39;s a drawing glove, thks (yeaps I&#39;m cheap ;).
Review the lenevo flex 5 2 in 1 amd
this is an amazing laptop, i got it for art and it is working well for me

I winder if wacom will ever make  to go drawing tablet.... probably not
What about Asus ROG flow GV301 X13?
Hey Brad, could you tell me where you bought it because I am super sad to say my ENVY doesn&#39;t include a pen ://<br><br>I really absolutely love the device though.
I just got this pc for school and I happen to also be looking for a draw pad.. what pen are y’all using?
Does it work with other 3rd Party Pens as well ?
You can also get a Windows Ink pen (I believe that Wacom sells them as well) that is compatible with this laptop.
can you do acer spin 5? there arent lot of drawing review on that 2in1 laptop
are you stupid? I can&#39;t see drawing because of your hand!!!! is this pen draw test? are you sure? put camera to left side!!!!!!!
Are there 3rd party pens that you can use and are a little bit more accurate?
I was thinking of getting this instead of an ipad air 4 because i can get either one (ipad air 4 with apple pencil or this envy x360 for the same price) but that was until i tried the pens...man the hp pen is literally hard plastic on glass I don’t know if i can get used to that it’s hilariously slippery. The Apple Pencil 2 has just enough rubbery resistance feel to it. This is meant to be primarily a note taking device for study and media consumption and a word and excel document here and there. Now im confused both are solid purchases
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHUmm5xOQdg&amp;t=3m57s">3:57</a> That was unexpected, it cracked me up xD <br>I need to have something like this and iPad is too expensive... but this laptop doesn&#39;t seem good enough :(
The computer in this video is a 13.3 inch?!<br>It seems bigger when you were drawing on it 😅 <br>Thanks 👍🏻
I am crying

Anyone able to help with tablet mode and rotation? New machine (the Ryzen 7 model), got 2 days ago. Worked for a couple of times going into tablet mode by folding the screen back but then it stopped working properly. Depending on its mood it either (a) doesn&#39;t turn on tablet mode when flipping the screen back (but the keyboard does get disabled, so that works, (b) refuses to autorotate in tablet mode, (c) leaves the keyboard disabled when returning to laptop mode. Have tried everything I could find online. Did all windows updates and HP updates (it updated the BIOS, too). Spent a couple of hours with Microsoft support who were unable to fix it. Occasionally, just after booting, the rotation works, but then it randomly stops working. So does anyone have experience of this and managed to find a solution? Thanks! It should basically allow me to fold the screen back and become a tablet that auto rotates, then flip the screen back over and it automatically becomes a laptop. Mine doesn&#39;t. To rub things in, it even says &quot;autorotate&quot; on the screen when you put it into tablet mode by flipping the screen back sometimes... Thanks in advance.
Can I replace  the pen
How does it do with gaming?
Does it ruin the keyboard when you fold it?
Can you use the stylus to draw and write on screen in a Zoom meeting?  The main reason I consider this model is that I&#39;ve  wanted to write on screen,  Zoom whiteboard, or draw on screen using a stylus to explain better during the Zoom meeting
This guy didn&#39;t do a good job. Guys this is and ryzen 7 8 cores 16gm ram no lag when gaming. This  laptop is great with the touch screen super thin. This is compared to 11th get Intel with 16g ram
Can someone tell me if I need a screen protector for this
How about its durability like how much years it can survive?
I&#39;ve had an 15 inch Envy 360 just like this since about May 2019. Mine did NOT come with a pen though. I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s a newer feature than when I got mine? I do have a Wacom Bamboo pen that I bought with it, but I confess, I never really took some REAL time to get past the learning curve of using it. I&#39;ve recently been thinking about getting a pen tablet to draw with (like a Huion H320 or XP Pen Deco), but seeing this, I might give drawing directly on my laptop another shot before I throw money at something new!

Will it run heavy software such as matlab, scada and other automation softwares?
has anyone elses pen marked the screen, mine is leaving faint but noticeable marks on the screen that cannot be removed ?
App?
How about note taking?
Does this come with MS office life time ? Or do I need to buy the full version?
Watching this on my 15.6 inch version. Great for school, notes, and doodling lol

Isn&#39;t the RAM soldered?
I am so confused between Yoga C740 and this one. Which one is better overall? 😐
What app do you use to draw?  I am bran new to this..  I got this laptop do Christmas 🎄⛄
I think the RAM is actually soldered, so you can not upgrade it. Just saying :)
Have you noticed any anomaly in the display? If you don&#39;t adjust the angle properly, you see part of screen already darker. Poor edge visibility. Pity, i had doubt about Nits of Brightness, and tried to play with settings and colors. is it because of the glossy panel? Or its a cheap quality?
Does the envy x360 13 functions the same as 15 but just bigger?
I just got this computer, but the oen has no pressure...does anyone know how do fix that?
really ... can you change the RAM :o..... pls confirm this!
I think you didn&#39;t talk about color accuracy of this laptop. Is it accurate or mostly accurate? I&#39;m struggling with my current laptop for not showing same colors as other screens.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHUmm5xOQdg&amp;t=3m30s">3:30</a> does anybody can confirm that? For what I know, previous models of envy x360 does not allow ram upgrades, becouse they are welded to the motherboard.
Which software use for drawing in this vedio ?? Plz tell me
Can you recommend the best pen, i could use for this?
Is this good for virtualization? I would almost  always need Linux running in Virtual box/VMware.
Plz review like this for lenovo ideapad 5 flex,, wanna know how it performs for art against this.
Hi, i searching a Laptop for the university. Which one is better? The Huawei Matebook 13 or this Hp Envy X360?<br><br>Thanks👋
How can you get that for 600!!!
Please review the Acer Spin 5 or Lenovo Yoga 6!
omg thanks i just found the laptop what i want
Can i play story games on that?
Anyone considering this laptop should also look at the Lenovo Yoga. It does a lot of the same stuff and actually has a silo for storing the pen. I bought mine a year ago and really like it.
So it isn’t good for video editing?
Tip: MS Surface pens should work with this laptop!
Is it possible to upgrade the ram
I want to use one of these for my long arm quilter.  So ideally, it would be great to be able to leave it in the bracket on the machine folded in half in tablet mode.  My question is, is there a way to power it on while in tablet mode, or do I need to remove it from the bracket, set it up as a laptop then turn the power on?  So far if I leave it in tablet, I am unable to power it up.  I&#39;ve looked around at settings and haven&#39;t found an answer to my question.  It&#39;s probably something simple that I have overlooked.  Thank You for your time in responding to my question.
Hey bro do check out the Lenovo Flex 5 AMD RYZEN 4700U as well and see how you like it. Its a direct competitor for this laptop. It does have a screen which is a tad bit slimmer than hp though
Hi Brad, can we use Wacom pen? with HP pen, Are there Right + Middle mouse button? Is it work if we turn off Ink? It&#39;s important because I use 3ds max alot. Thank you
Does to have Ms office and if it does is it for lifetime or just one month trial???
is it possible to hook up a drawing tablet to it  and mirror the image ?  being there is no dedicated video card ?
Hi! Is that good for notes, using it as if it is an iPad?
Can I use capacitive stylus with it ? Can I use apple pencil ? Pls help
does anyone know where to find a keyboard and hard case protector for this?
Loved this review. Id like to hear you review the Surface 8 with Photoshop,  when it comes out
There was a magnet of the pen when i bought this laptop
drawing in photoshop, lol, illustrator is made for drawing
What a strange conclusion? If you need good pen, you just need to buy a good pen, there is no need to look for another laptop! The pricing on this laptop is so amazing! It&#39;s 2-3 times cheaper than IPad Pro with keyboard and pencil.
I’m getting a hp pavilion x360
Is it very small ?
I highly wouldnt recommend this laptop for drawing. I&#39;ve taking notes on the surface, spectre, envy, inspiron, and a yoga. The surface by far has the best pen experience (least amount of squiggles on lines) followed by the inspiron and then the envy/spectre/yoga. The difference between the spectre (my daily) and my surface pro/surface book are substantial to the point where I actively tell people to avoid it if you&#39;re getting it for a more pen based experience. The xps and inspiron line are far far better for a creative user than the spectre and envy line. Trust me theres a reason why i keep a my 2017 surface pro around when i have a 2019 spectre for main use.


Are the hinges durable?
Hey, <br>I have been looking at the HP envy x360 15.6” Ryzen 5 laptop for uni and since i am an Architect student I would like to know if these laptops are good for performing tasks on powerful softwares like CAD/ Sketchup. <br><br>If anyone could let me know I would really appreciate it. Thank you

Great review, man I wish you had the rechargable pen lol very curious on that one.



Can you do a comparison with HP specter x360
Get hp envy x360 15 inch 8 core ryzen 32gb ram 1tb ssd upgradeable memory and storage and better pen...cost more but you get pay for...or get dell equivalent inspiron?
My father got the same laptop for 1K Euros-<br>+ we didn’t get a pen :&lt;

Thanks for that review, now I know I don&#39;t want that laptop XD<br>Could you do a review of the Lenovo IdeaPad Flex too, please? ^^
Ram is soldered
have you reviewed an acer spin 5 or lenovo flex 5  (AMD)?
I’m not an artist but u can just buy a seperate pen that’s what I did when I got this
which one for web developer<br>2020 HP Envy x360 2in1 15.6&quot; FHD Touch-Screen Newest Flagship Laptop, AMD Ryzen 7 4700U 8-core(Beat i9-8950HK, up to 4.1GHz), 16GB Memory, 1TB PCIe SSD, Fast Charge, Backlit-KB<br>or<br> HP Envy x360 2-in-1 15.6&quot; FHD Touchscreen Laptop Computer, Intel Core i7-10510U, 32GB RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD, Intel UHD Graphics, B&amp;O Audio, HD Webcam, USB-C, Win 10, Silve<br>or<br>Dell - Inspiron 14 7000 2-in-1 - 14&quot; Touch-Screen Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 - 16GB Memory - 512GB SSD - Sandstorm<br><br>thaks for your respond
Is it supports tilting in adobe illustrator and other software?
It is gaming laptop ???plz rpy mr
I&#39;ve owned the predecessor to this one (the envy x360 13-ar0210ng; R7-3700U 16GB 512GB) for almost a year now. After about 4 months the cable in the hinge was damaged and the screen began having random artefacts (e.g. half the screen not working (just black) or flickering). There also were (and are) some other problems but yeah

good test can you make a review for dell inspiron 14 5400 and Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5
How&#39;s the glare on this thing?With ambient light is it reflective?
pls send the link for the pen you are using
I think that this laptop also supports the Microsoft Pen Protocol 2.0, what means you could also use the Surface Pen V4 or something like that
You have the wrong link (for the 15 inch one) in your description!
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHUmm5xOQdg&amp;t=3m30s">3:30</a> you do not open the back pretty easily because you must pull the rubber strip where it hides more screws &amp; you cannot install more RAM because there are no memory slots (all soldered down). that has same energy with &quot;you can always download more RAM&quot;. you didn&#39;t check it by yourself, did you?
Would someone be able to tell me if scratches appear on the screen after a lot of drawing use?
Can the usb c be used for charging?
I will buy the one with ryzen 5 4500u,8gb ram,512gbssd &amp; 400nits display
You can get  the newest base one on the hp website for just 620 dollars, and if you pay 30 dollars more in the configuration, you can get the newer tilt rechargeable pen.
Does anyone know of any pens for this laptop preferably on Amazon? Thanks! I don&#39;t kno what happened to mine

Is it good for office work. Video editing ?
For the same price is this a better buy compared to the Asus Zenbook 14&quot; with the R5 4500U &amp; 350MX?
Is it strange that I feel like I could kiss you for that video? This was right what I&#39;ve been searching for. Thanks for the review, Brad!
What are better pen alternatives?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHUmm5xOQdg&amp;t=5m42s">5:42</a> you&#39;re holding it wrong
i had an intel 10th gen 15inch version of the envy and 4k oled screen. i sent it for repair because it lagged like hell just while scrolling in the browser and they werent able to resolve it. intel sucks so much these days. i just ordered the R7 13&quot; version <a href="https://geizhals.at/hp-envy-x360-13-ay0278ng-nightfall-black-16d33ea-abd-a2294207.html">https://geizhals.at/hp-envy-x360-13-ay0278ng-nightfall-black-16d33ea-abd-a2294207.html</a> instead. looking forward to have a great 2in1 device now.
do you have a review for lenovo ideapad flex 5 ?
Can u tell me if u experienced any over heating or loud fan or freezing issues please
hello brad, im kinda new to all this pen, so can you recommend me a pen to start drawing on laptop ? is the surface pen ok and usable on this laptop?
what do you think is a better pen that&#39;s compatible with this laptop ?
What&#39;s better the pavillion or the envy?
I got this laptop since last year. I love it.<br>The only complaint are the palm detection. Even with the gloves on, when certain seam of the glove touch the screen. It will detect. <br>It is annoying when I am taking notes, sometimes the palm/glove detection will happen at the scroll bar or some other button, making it almost impossible to do notes. <br>As shown in the video. Drawing will always leave the palm/glove detection dots. So prepare to leaen to draw without touching the screen.
For non hardware enthusiasts here the r5 4500u is faster than the 10th gen I7 and the 4700u is in another league. They all are actually compared to intel .Get the 4500u not the 4300u it&#39;s not bad but the 4500u is just amazing
Is this laptop good for Architecture student?

Is HP envy 13&quot; a right choice for Adobe Premiere Pro? I&#39;m really confused between AMD and intel. I don&#39;t care much about export time, but playback smoothness and no shuttering is important.
what about the hp pavilion 360
What about Asus vivobook flip I think it&#39;s better
How about the sound quality?
He changed the name of the Website... something wrong i can feel it
I thought the RAM is soldered and can only be upgraded if customized on HP-shop website
Please review the HP Spectre x360 2020? seeing serious mixed review re:wobly pen otherwise excellent specs.
I bought the Ryzen 5 variant with 1TB of Nvme M.2 storage a few days ago for 860€ here in Germany and so far I&#39;m really satisfired.<br>Even video editing within Davinci Resolve is no problem and works perfect.
Does the surface pen work well on it?
I just got it me likey lol
does anyone know if the hp spectre is good for drawing too?
Can u review the Lenovo flex 5 please
My one didn&#39;t come with a pen and was not told about any options for it. One of the coleuges said that it comes with a pen but it unfortunately did not. I also called up the company and they said it doesn&#39;t come with a pen. I am very confused and hope you could recommend what pen to get that&#39;s compatible.
Can you do elite dragonfly so I can make sure that I can animate in it please brad
Is it just his art style or should I be worried of the wiggly lines 😅

I was deciding between this with a Ryzen 7, 16GB of RAM and 1TB SSD (1000 nits display model) and the Acer Spin which was a Wacom stylus and taller screen but only had a quad core i5 with a base clock of 1,1GHz and half of the storage plus the weaker Iris Plus G4 GPU for more so I went AMD after a decade with Intel... I hope I will not regret it :D
How long does the battery last ? is this fast charging ? what is the power of battery built in ?

Did you try also other pens that are compatible? Pen standards aren&#39;t that much, if this uses AES 2.0 it may support a lot of pens, including wacoms&#39;. Maybe the experience with a better active pen is better overall
Hey Brad, take a look at the fujitsu Lifebook series of 2in1 convertibles, I have a rather old T901 but would like to upgrade to their latest , Lifebook T939.
Which one is better?? This or surface pro 7??

Can we upgrade ram or storage on HP ENVY x360 Laptop - 15-ee0047nr?
how is it compared to surface devices in terms of pen responsiveness and parallax? also if i use a surface pen on it, will i retain all the same full set of features like button single click and double click shortcuts?
i LOVE that you actually test writing and drawing. but WHY FOR CHRIST&#39;S SAKE do you block the view with your own hand... nobody gets it right

No decent palm rejection?
Anyone else got this for 580?
Dude checkout lenovo ideapad flex 5 amd ryzen 7 version
What do you guys think is better for Uni, The HP 360  with ryzen 7 or the Samsung tab s7+. I like to use Onenote for note taking on the textbooks.
Can you play red dead demption 2 on this?
Can&#39;t wait to see your video on the note 20 ultra
would you say this is good for stuff like urban design?
I&#39;ve been using this laptop&#39;s quiet mode, which all but stops the fan, and it&#39;s been pretty good so far!
No, we can&#39;t upgrade the ram its soldered, do proper research first
Is that wacom aes tech?<br><br>@edit, for those who are wondering its Microsoft MPP so any surface pro 3+ pens will work. I wonder if they are any better than this hp pen.
I had a 15 inch Envy last year. Color quality was horrible. For example, the color red was just a dark pink. I couldn&#39;t get used to it and finally sold it. A big disappointment...  😣
Ram is not upgradable on the 13&#39;&#39; model. Only on the 15&#39;&#39; model.
Only downside of amd is no thunderbolt port
Hi from Germany. Thanks for your opinion.<br>Just one point to fix: the RAM is soldered on board so not upgradeble.
Beware of the 1000 nits HP privacy screen called Sure View. The viewing angles are so bad that I had to return mine. Even if the privacy mode is disabled. I‘m now super happy with the 400 nits version.
Is this pen tip same to surface 3 pro?
Hey you should fix your video, I own this laptop, and you cannot open it up and add more.  On this model the Ram is soldered to the mother board.
WARNING, DO NOT GET THIS FOR ART! -  I got one of these in 2019 specifically to draw on the go. It was hell!. I went through 3 pens, and none had pressure sensitivity, spoke to at least 10 HP agents, none knew anything about the pens or software, the software they do have is hard to find, patches are on random hidden pages with contradictory information, software only supports a couple pen models, the pen buttons were not programmable. There was no documentation, there is no coherent naming convention...After about 3 months of back and forth HP eventually said that the AMD models don&#39;t support pressure pen, even though it is advertised to. So they replaced my AMD Envy model with an Intel Spectre, again I bought 2 official HP pens that I was told by HP would work, niether of them worked, went through all the same sh!t again. Eventually I just gave up - gonna just buy an ipad or galaxy tab because HP doesn&#39;t have any guidance or plan for their pens, it&#39;s just a gimmick to them - Unless they&#39;ve done a huge update in the last 6 months, I would not recommended HP360 line for drawing.



Dude can u tell a touchscreen laptop in which u can do gaming too under $700
I know its a big shot, but we need your help to reach to hp. After the bios update F.08 many people are facing a locking screen problem, there is a thread dedicated for it in both Microsoft and hp community forums, we have already contacted the customer support but the response from their side is not good, if any hp guy is reading this comment please go through this links I am providing and please release a stable version of bios ASAP,<br> <br><a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Gaming-Notebooks/RANDOM-SHUTDOWN-AFTER-BIOS-UPDATE/td-p/7714583/page/14">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Gaming-Notebooks/RANDOM-SHUTDOWN-AFTER-BIOS-UPDATE/td-p/7714583/page/14</a><br><br><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/the-screen-says-locking-and-it-goes-into-sleep/cf8de14e-2178-4b7d-8159-a0b08552e2ce#:~:text=Check%20that%20now%20at%20Settings,%2Fwindows%2Ffor..">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/the-screen-says-locking-and-it-goes-into-sleep/cf8de14e-2178-4b7d-8159-a0b08552e2ce#:~:text=Check%20that%20now%20at%20Settings,%2Fwindows%2Ffor..</a>.
It&#39;s worth noting that only the 400 nit screens on the x360 13&quot; amd models are rated for 100% sRGB coverage, and I don&#39;t think that any of the screen options do on the 15&quot; amd models
Hope we would get this laptop for this same price in India <a href="http://too.now/">too.Now</a> it&#39;s 400$ more expensive 😭
Review Lenovo Flex 5 and its pen, please? Thanks!
This or the iPad Air 3 (maybe air 4 when it Comes out?)???
Don&#39;t mention the fact that it can game cause I need this to show my parents


I drew stuffs on this 15 inch ryzen version.  No pen,  just finger-drawings on the touch screen.  But no pressure sensitivity as a downside, unless you can alternately connect a drawing tablet.
The ram is soldered on in the 13 inch so you can&#39;t upgrade the ram
Nah man I have this laptop and it keeps crashing its bad for school
Could you please review Lenovo Flex 5?
I wish i could get e brighter display and ryzen 5 processor instead of thid gimmick touch screen...
Can I ask you??? I am a student and I don&#39;t play any games or work in Photoshop, so the version with AMD Ryzen 3 is OK for me?

He always reviews these laptops but his go to is the iPad lol. Great reviews, it&#39;s just funny.





In India that will be like $1000. Laptops are unnecessaralye expensive inn India .
This is a sexy thing, the screen looks soo good.
I&#39;ve enjoyed your review videos! Keep em coming! :)
I received it a week ago.<br>Pretty solid machine even under Linux.<br>Quite nice with 16GB of ram &amp; the Ryzen 4700u. I just purchased the pci-e wifi Ax200 from intel so it gets the nicest wifi-6 from intel.<br>Realtek wifi cards are generally garbage and this one is no exception.<br>For 10$ I highly recommend anyone purchasing this laptop to change it.<br><br>Note: The 15&quot; does not have the same color accuracy as the 13&quot;. So that might be a show stopper for some.<br>I have the 13&quot; and it&#39;s the low power screen, quite bright and properly calibrated.
Please do a review of a high-end Lenovo Yoga C940. I would love an artist review of it before committing to such an expensive product!
watching it on the same laptop lol
Please do a review of HP SPECTRE x360 from digital art perspective! I want to start Digital Art but I am confused between a touch screen 360 laptop or a drawing tablet, i.e XP-Pen or Wacom, which do you suggest.

hey brad can you do a drawing user experience video on the 15 inch higher end model?
Can you do a comparison between ipad pro and huawei matepad pro?
Lenovo Flex 5 would have been better for $599 from Amazon. Ryzen 4500U/16GB RAM/256 SSD
Is this laptop good for editing?
Please also use Krita alongside Photoshop and Sketchbook!
Hey can u review lenovo ideapad flex 5 s14
Are you going to reviee the cp-pen innovator 16?
I have to say thank you so much, for the past year I’ve been looking for drawing tablets and other digital drawing tools, I have to say you’re reviews are so detailed and you direct people on how to use it and it’s controls! The reason I commented on this video is because it’s the latest and I hope you see this and get a ego boost! You are such a amazing youtuber :p

what other pen to go with this laptop would you recommend for a smoother drawing experience?

Watching this review on the 15&quot; Ryzen 5 version (just bought it a few days ago). I haven&#39;t done any art or drawing but everything - software and apps - absolutely flies. I would absolutely recommend it and agree with everything in this review.














I have the previous model
İpad pen vs samsung pen plsssssss like
Budget ?! I checked it out and it&#39;s 800. That&#39;s expensive, anything above it is just overpriced!!
I got the same pen with my envy x360 15&quot; and after about 10 minutes of drawing it starts to draw lines SO WAVED that you just can&#39;t draw anymore. Even restarting does not help, it has to &quot;calm down&quot; on its own.
What about Hp pavilion 360 is it good for art? Any thoughts on that?
I actually bought this laptop a bit ago. It&#39;s amazing quality and extremely fast (with a 4700u). The tilt pen definitely works better for thirty bucks more. The 13in version is NOT Ram-upgradeable, but the 15in version is. All versions are SSD upgradeable with one slot.<br>If anyone has questions, I&#39;d be glad to answer.











You can&#39;t upgrade ram on the 13 inch model
What about Samsung Tab s6 vs.  Huion kamvas13 ?
Why did you change form Colbow to cowboy?<br>Cowboy just sounds stupid
You said &quot;...you can install more ram if you need to.&quot; I&#39;m pretty sure the ram is soldered in this model(just like most ultrabooks nowadays). Which is too bad.
Could you do a review of the new 2020 Acer spin 3? They have them several places, and I know a Costco for $650. Acer collaborated with Wacom for the software and drawing aspects of it. The pen can be store inside the laptop too.
The pen upgrade is $30 on HP’s website is Tilt enabled. Also you can only upgrade the ram on the 15 inch, but you can upgrade the ssd on both.
RAM’s soldered I believe
Been despreatly looking for the video with those angry racoons and their grr sounds xD which one was it please, I got to see it again!
This laptop does not have user replaceable memory, just the SSD is upgradable. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHUmm5xOQdg&amp;t=3m30s">3:30</a> is wrong.
It supports the MPP2.0 pen protocol so you can use other pens, such as the surface pen or the new HP pen with it

He&#39;s wrong, the RAM in the 13&quot; Envy x360 isn&#39;t user upgradable.
I have the 15&quot; model with Ryzen 7. And it&#39;s a beast of a laptop. Especially for CPU related tasks. But... I am a 3D artist. And I chose this laptop because I wanted something more portable than a gaming laptop which are powerful, and a separate pen display. And I really thought this was going to be it. Well it is but isn&#39;t. It has decent power and performance for basic 3d sculpting work. And standard 3D poly modeling it handles easily. But, the pen support. The palm rejection is horrid, and the barely 1cm above the screen you have to be for the pen to be activated makes this a pain. I went with Wacom&#39;s Bamboo active stylus Best Buy sells people on after looking at some reviews. And the problem I have found is that the buttons on this stylus or HPs own cant be remapped to middle mouse click. And that is important to me as it&#39;s the button you normally use in Blender to rotate around your scene. Which is very handy when sculpting and working naturally. I found a work around using HP&#39;s own Pen utility by mapping a button to Alt and turning on 3 button mouse emulation in Blender. But over all the device makes me wish I just lugged around my XP Pen Artist 15.6 Pro instead. Because as professionals we want the tools to be out of the way of our creative process. And sadly this just hasn&#39;t been it. I will probably sell this laptop and use a basic machine to remote desktop into my workstation at home and bring along a simple pen tablet instead. So close. But yet soo far.
What&#39;s with the &quot;Cowboy&quot; reference in your name? Seems really weird. Hey,..whatever floats your boat. LOL!!! I must have missed the point of the joke or something. Cannot wait until you get your hands on the forthcoming Samsung Galaxy 7PLUS tablet!!! I&#39;ll be ready to &quot;saddle up&quot; for THAT review!
you cant upgrade ram in the 13&quot; model
Changing Storage yes, but RAM no, it is soldered on board you cannot change RAM
This may get me to upgrade my vostro 1500. This is a beauty.
Are you sure about upgrading the memory???.... I Know very well this line off laptop , and none of them are upgradeable .... Maybe I&#39;m missing something here...
Hp z review plz ✍️ 👩‍💻
Can you PLEASE do Lenovo Chromebook Duet review? Its a super affordable chromebook AND Android TABLET with great built quality. It think its a great laptop replacement if your willing to go the anroid route. &lt;-- using Brad language here ^^
can you also do a review on the hp pavillion x360 2019
Hey Brad! Great review! Personally exactly what I was looking for as I also am on the search for a 2 in 1 with a more &quot;creator&quot; focus. I&#39;m also looking for one with a strong gpu for 3d work as well.<br><br>Will you be doing a review on the Acer ConceptD3 Ezel, slated to come out sometime this month? It&#39;s a 1400 base 2 in 1 with what looks like MPP and not wacom EMR. Would appreciate it if you were able to review this product :)
Bro, which will be better as a laptop between Lenovo Flex 5 and HP envy 360? Which one has better drawing capabilities? Any suggestions will be appreciated 🤠.

i thought you said 650 $ ?? why is it showing in your link for 730 $ ???
You can&#39;t upgrade the ram later because it is soldered on to the motherboard
Make a video with upgraded version of this pen.
No, you can&#39;t upgrade ram on this model.



















Forget buying this laptop in Australia, the base model 13&quot; retails at $1,799, double the price of the same laptop in the USA.
Yeah i do want video of Lenovo c640
Can you do a review on the Lenovo Duet Chromebook please??🙏🙏
I bought an AMD Ryzen 7 with dedicated graphics on the laptop about a year ago. Its pretty solid. I customised it to also fit my needs
which would u prefer as a student, who does video editing. This one or the Hp Probook 15.6”  10th gen Intel
Sounds like a similar but weaker version of the lenovo ideapad flex 14 2in1.  That has 16gb ram + 256 gb ssd with the better 4500u processor though I&#39;d wager the 4300u is not slouch based on its other 4000 siblings.  The included pen is okay but drawing on a tab s6, ipad, or drawing pad like a deco pro small are far better drawing experiences. (in order of weakest to strongest)<br>The ideapad, if you can find it in stock is also $50 cheaper @ $599.  Similar ports: dc charging (uses usb c for charging though), usb c, 2 usb a, hdmi, and a card reader (full size)<br>I am very happy with the ideapad but I don&#39;t use the screen for drawing.  The 14&quot; screen will do for productivity too but you will have a better experience with a bigger external monitor.
HP Touchsmart first generation was my first screen tablet drawing type device. It had a screen that swiveled around 180 degrees and then folded under.  It was chunky, and heavy, the pen was awful (not that I knew that at the time) and it got super hot. But I loved it. Until the single middle hinge broke.  I loved it so much though, while I had it, took it with me everywhere back in college and soaked up the compliments and questions I got. I&#39;d never buy another one, but I&#39;ve got fond memories of that laptop.
Just got one of these for my son starting TAFE next year and put a 500Gb M.2 in it. A cheap upgrade that just let&#39;s you store your stuff.
Does the keyboard bother? I got to surface bc it detached.
I have the ryzen 7 and I love it
Dunno if I squinted and missed it, but is this compatible with the Surface pen? That any better?
You don&#39;t use the new pen from hp , that the envy support
Small correction.. the ram can&#39;t be upgraded. The 8gb ram is soldered on. The storage is the only upgradeable component of this machine. But a pretty good piece of tech for the 💰
I bought the 15&quot; model with Ryzen 5 3500 U for 550$ (before tax).. I was able to get this back in February.. It&#39;s a really good deal.. I bought a Wacom Bamboo ink smart stylus for this and it works fine.. I am a beginner for digital art, but I have to say, its has been a comfortable model to use so far..
You can only install more RAM on the 15 inch model.

Why none of these laptops have a screen kickstand like MS Surface? How the hell I&#39;m supposed to draw on it any other way than having it flat on the table? I want to use the keyboard while drawing.

your channel is not verified  O_o
brad, you are wrong  in one aspect.. You cannot upgrade the ram on this laptop.. the 13inch laptop has its ram soldered to it.. not sure about the 15.6inch model. but i&#39;m sure that you wont be able to upgrade the ram on the 13inch model... However you can upgrade the SSD .. So please correct that , since you dont want to give out wrong information... Good video though :)
budget laptop for photo editing ryzen 4000 (8 core) series any picks?
I&#39;ve seen review of this laptop lately, they used the new stylus that looked bit like the apple pencil also, I&#39;d really like to see more budget tab reviews like tab a8 with s-pen not a lot of review of this one
I used the ryzen 5 laptop envy and it is fantastic I love the form factor its amazing!
Just a fair warning, hp 2 in 1 laptops have problems with their hinges where they go crooked. I bought 2 Envys and they both had a problem.
90% sure the ram is NOT upgradeable due to it being soldered on. I have the same laptop (higher spec) and mine is soldered on. I got 16gbs of ram do to this
You put a stylus sticker on your laptop ,brad will test it
8gb of RAM in 2020? Even a Raspberry Pi have 8gb this days for a fraction of the cost!
I have this laptop - I heard rumor that this works with other tablet pens (Ntrig) can anyone confirm? Great review by the way! This laptop is pretty solid, been using it for a few days now
Hey Brad, I am not sure the RAM is upgradeable. On the other hand, I am pretty sure you can turn the screen the other way around so the vent is away from you. It supports tent mode after all right?

I thought you can&#39;t add more RAM to this device, since its  8GB is soldered on?

please tab s7 and s7+ comparison or .review

Please try Lenovo C340..
Brad have you used the surface pen on it. I think it uses the same ntrig as microsoft. Will that give better results
From the first video I watched you i just Loved your speak way, gloves dance. I want to buy drawing screen tablet for my laptop i see your website and I chose to go with xp pen 13pro thanks for reviewing all of XP pen tablet huwion it really helps me chose. If you could review other window drawing tablet it will be nice to. Thanks.
I Want see the new s pen<br>Galaxy tab s7 plus
Ram is soldered in motherboard..you can&#39;t updrade ram , but SSD can be upgraded.
What about the screen color accuracy?
I’m a designer and just bought the HP Envy x360 15.4” and it’s the absolute best! 16gb ram 512gb ssd ryzen 7 4700

I have the 15inch version, with the Ryzen 7. In the UK, the rechargeble pen comes included. I have previously used Wacom Bamboo and Intus on a iMac and I liked the Wacom pens. I do actually like the HP pen and the tilt feature. With the 15 inch, the pen has magnets and sticks all over the machine. My pen is different from yours. I had a different drawing experience from you, with no wiggley lines. I also have not had any issues with my palm on the screen. <br>I mainly do pen and ink drawings using ArtRage and Corel software. I think this is very good and I am very happy I purchased it. I now use Windows 10 for work and creative work/drawing, as opposed to the iMac for the latter.

I’m disappointed due to palm rejection dots
Is that screen really bright enough at 300 nits? Here in the UK they give us shite as per usual, even the ryzen 7 comes with 300 nit screen and it doesn&#39;t get wifi 6 either!
I  like having the option to game and draw. I currently use a gaming laptop with a Huion 1060 plus to draw. Am I crazy to swap out the Huion fora Tab S7+?<br>Is there an all in one for less than £3K that can game at max settings? (Adding A Tab S7+ will take my setup to just under £3K)

tab s 6 S-Pen wins for me if you dont count the wacom&#39;s
I had this once. Had to return it because of my budget. Loved it tho
I&#39;m still happy with my samsung galaxy book, the pen is wacom technology and the screen is beautiful, the only problem is the heating in summer
Hey brad your drawing quality has improved a lot... could u plz do a few new tutorials or maybe a course 🤩

i hope you can review Huawei Matepad Pro, sir.

Hell!😀 Yeah we want more reviews of windows 2 in one. I&#39;ve been commenting to review this laptop for long time. Thanks so much 😀
Can somebody reply with the exact model link for the laptop brad has the one brad put in the wrong model
The Microsoft pen, though pricy is compatible with this laptop. I have used it to do some light skating with this laptop, not bad
i stopped watching after the minute you said the pen isn&#39;t good enough lol
OK, I&#39;m gonna mention the Lenovo Yoga C940. I bought the 15.6&quot; FHD model, on sale at Best Buy for about $1200, a few months ago. Look for more sales later. I&#39;ve been using Tablet PCs since they first came out in about 2003. This laptop stylus is the best I&#39;ve seen (other than those first Wacom EMR models I owned). I spent a couple hours comparing all the different stylus enabled laptops and this one beat them all, hands down. The whole Surface line is terrible. The HPs are flat out awful. Others were so so.<br><br>The C940 did almost perfect on the diagonal line test AND I can sign my name 1/8&quot; tall land it still looks really good and like my actual handwriting. All the others failed the tiny signature test miserably.<br><br>I did immediately replace the 256GB SSD with a $250 2TB 3500 SSD and it is now the fastest machine I have ever owned.
please make a review on Lenovo flex 14 AMD( Ideapad flex 5)
I had an older HP XPS 360 Spectre (I think). The stylus was terrible. If this one is OK, is warn people to NOT get an older model, thinking it would be just as good.
Wait! I thought your name was Brad Colbow. How did I read this wrong all this time?
Man I bought the Envy last year and I thought the drawing experience was absolutely unacceptable, I should&#39;ve waited another year to get this one! They seemed to have upped the quality and the specs a LOT in just a year
360 degree hinge could be a problem in the future. I have a Lenovo Yoga 520, and the hinge broke the body and chassis of my laptop. The hinge failed and doesn&#39;t want to be turned, it pries open the body everytime I move the screen.
Brad can you review the Dell p2418ht
Yes review 2 in ones, especially with EMR Pens. Love the Samsung’s 2 in ones. Looking forward to the S7 full review. Thanks for the reviews.
I stopped my search at the Samsung Notebook 9 Pro 15&quot; from 2017. It&#39;s got an AMD gpu and the color accuracy is about as good as a budget pen display - not as accurate as the Xp-Pen I sold it for. However, the laptop uses the S Pen, so I was able to use the Galaxy Tab S4 for it. It&#39;s crazy how it&#39;s more accurate than my pen displays pen - which is a dedicated device! I got it for $550 - and I could have got the HP Zbook x2 for $660. I probably should have for the 4K 100% Adobe display, but the processor and gpu are weaker and i kinda want to play games too haha.<br><br>It&#39;s also pretty light
I&#39;ve been watching your videos for the perfect e-drawing device for a while now. I never bought anything electronic and instead your videos and others led me to getting a sketch book and some nice graphite pencils.
I&#39;d love to see more videos like this because I&#39;m also on the lookout for a good 2 in 1 laptop for drawing
You should review the Inspiron 7000 Black Edition. Has a full-sized pen garage.
yes more reviews man, I like your reviews very much.
Every device has a butt.  LOL  You just have to consider what is singularly most important and buy the device that is best in that category.  Then you have to live with the butts as best you can.
Why is it so hard to find a computer that uses a Wacom EMR pen? Why does everyone use Ntrig? It can&#39;t be that more expensive, Samsung can put it into a $250 tablet. It just seems like there are soooooooo many art computers that just shoot themselves in the foot by using Microsoft&#39;s tech, it makes no sense.
700 is cheap?

for some reason I&#39;ve always misread your name as &quot;Brad Colbow&quot; and i only just realized it...


Can you use other pens with this laptop?
I can&#39;t wait for the tab s7 plus review
sketchbook actually has a feature that is the palm rejection, it simply starts drawing when it detects the pen and you can still move around using your fingers
Nice republican tshirt trump for the win!!!!#
Brad you should look at the Acer Conceptd 7 Ezel<br>Yes I know it is really expensive but it may just scratch your itch
Very good Sandhya Tiwari
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHUmm5xOQdg&amp;t=3m02s">3:02</a> Why would you do that? You would void all keyboard shortcut keys xD
AMD&#39;s 4000 series is FAR superior to Intel counterparts. Going forward it is likely going to get even worse for Intel.
I own both the intel version of this and a surface pro 3 and can confirm they&#39;re using the same pen tech. What&#39;s odd is that I found out the Ubuntu version of the stylus driver has a little less wave to it and handles palm rejection better. So I&#39;m starting to wonder if it&#39;s a Windows problem?
I bought an HP x360 Workstation  $2k and also has the rechargeable pen... pen has wiggle, and it annoyed me so much I bought an iPad Pro and got a Macbook Pro, and I also have a Wacom Intuos, much better set up.  I can still be very portable with the iPad, and I also use a pen for everything, either the apple pencil or the Wacom (don&#39;t even have a mouse on my desk anymore). Both work flawlessly in InDesign (I&#39;m a graphic designer for a magazine, so I use it a lot). And drawing or sketching in procreate is very hard to beat (I have never liked using photoshop for my drawings, but that&#39;s just personal preference).
Great review.  I don&#39;t suppose you had a chance to try the Surface pen on this since this uses MPP 2.0?  I&#39;m wondering if that would make a difference.  I think the included pen is one of HP&#39;s older pens
AMD beats the crap out of intel and budget friendly
Can you check out the Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5. I would like to know your thoughts on it too.
I have this laptop and use the surface pen with it and it&#39;s kinda brilliant
But how do you use hotkeys?
I know there&#39;s no excuse for a jittery pen but in SketchBook, artists can use the Steady Stroke command to get very smooth lines at any angle. Just a tip.
Are u gonna review the Acer conceptd 5 and conceptd 7 ezel (from what I heard one has a n trig pen and the other a more Wacom like  experience ) ?
How would this work for 2D animation?
I have the same sentiment on the pen response on my Lenovo C340 as well...<br>Been thinking to replace it with Wacom Bamboo Ink, but the cost of that thing deters me...<br>The laptop alone, already bled me enough. Probably later on...
I love watching brad draw
This great for a laptop that costs 700 dollars

I cannot be 100% sure since i dont have the base pen just the older  rechargable tilt pen, but its performance seems to be a lot better, it also has an &quot;eraser&quot;  button on the back which is nice (the eraser part also works as a capacitive touch surface for devices that dont support pens).
After watching the cintiq 24 pro I just realized that the channel name turned into Brad cowboy<br><br><br>Red dead redemption 2 am I right?
Can you please review the acer Conceptd 9 laptop
I would rather do video editing on an amd ryzen processor than on an Intel

Yes i would love to see more laptop as art computer reviews!!! Ive always wondered if x360 laptops are a good idea and so far it seems to be a very very mixed bag in terms of doing art



I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW NOBODY REVIEW THIS FOR ART NOT TO MENTION I WAS ABOUT TO BUY IT!

Did anyone noticed iy was brad cowboy not colbow 🤔🤔 hmmm braad???
Can you review hp pavilion x360 next?
Hi Brad are you gonna review Samsung tab s7 or 7+ or both? I mean they are not the same display what the difference between them? Thanks
guys i have a question does anyone know how to send your krita artwork to your instagram??
Please do a iPad 7th gen review:)

I have the previous model, and it&#39;s basically useless for art. I&#39;m only a beginner, but even i can tell that it sucks.
No one:<br><br><br>Absolutely no one:<br><br><br>Brad: making everyone&#39;s quarantine a million times better
did he change his name?
Please review Lenovo IdeaPad flex 5
love it!!! I&#39;ve really wanted to see an artist&#39;s perspective of the Spectre x360
I expect you to be wearing chaps and a 10 gallon hat in every episode now with this name change :)
I was thinking to buy this laptop, so I decided to look over the review first. Dayumm, who knows this video is 1 hour ago 😂

AMD ryzen is actualy way better than intel especially for content creator, there&#39;s a reason why apple decide to ditch intel lol
Hi Brad, good review as always, but...fujitsu lifebook with wacom emr?(T901-904-935 or similar)My old T5010 is very good with clip studio paint and for... 90€
I dont consider 709 euros on a budget....<br>I call 50 euros a budget
I’ll take all the reviews you got dude!
I already have the things I need to make digital art yet I still click on every one of your videos even if I never plan on buying the products being reviewed. Fantastic review as always Brad. Hopefully one day you&#39;ll do a live draw of your artwork. I really like your art style.
Caneta com pilha me deixou triste fiquei maravilhado com o notebook mas isso meio que me broxou
Ok now try Convertible laptop with Wacom AES 2.0, Lenovo Flex or Yoga series.



Do it come with a smug gaurd
I&#39;m completely surprised you review convertible laptop with pen other than emr.
You should check the galaxy book flex alpha
does anyone know if this pen works with the old HP Envy x360?
Hi 👋
waiting for s7 plus tab s pen video  is better than apple 2 gen pencil and workflow of s7 plus
Any graphics card inside?
<b>Guys there is a new animation on my channel I hope you&#39;ll like it)</b>
Damn, not available in the UK, the 13 inch is £800 with worse specs.
This one caught my attention recently.<br><br>I’ll get it soon and I think it’s a great laptop tbh.





Is there a Lenovo alternative for this? Because I have wacom bamboo ink plus at home.<br>The only reason I hold back is cus I don&#39;t want ntrig

Brad can you do the review of Superbrush/superdisplay that helps android tablet to use it as a cintiq just like easy canvas or duet-display on an ipad.  And can you do the comparision between those?
Could you please try the HP Mpp 2.0 pen? I think it is better. Not sure tho
I have this one, and a year after it&#39;s still rocking. DO NOT BUY THE HP PEN, YOU CAN&#39;T REPLACE THE NIBS and it&#39;s hard and feels weird and when the nib wears out you have to buy another pen, buy Wacom&#39;s bamboo ink (it&#39;s fully compatible and nibs are replaceable).


Why won&#39;t Windows laptops use Wacom EMR?<br>Or why doesn&#39;t Microsoft improve N-trig? There has to be a way to make the drawing smoother... Because in every other aspect except the pen these laptops are perfect. Cheaper than an iPad Pro and comparable performance with AMD internals, plus wider range of applications and full desktop features. The only thing holding Windows laptops back from art domination is really the pen.




When all you see is the American metrics...
What’s with the Cowboy?
You should try out the Huawei matepad pro. I&#39;d love to see your thoughts on that
I wonder how Clip Studio performed on this device.

Please review Lenovo Ideapad Flex 5 AMD 4th Gen Ryzen 5 14 inch
Price in usa : 650$ <br><b>laughs in Indian taxation on electronics</b> ;-;




































Can we use any wacom pen on this device?
What happens to the products you review?
You legit look like Bobby dukes lol even sound alike.
Brad, keep doing videos like this, I have been looking for a laptop that you can draw on it, that does not suck on the specs. Thanks
For that price it’s a lot better than the surface go.
I wonder if windows ink was turned off if the wiggle would improve or worsen? I&#39;ve only had bad luck with windows ink :(
Excellent review Brad. I hope you can make more videos about windows all-in-ones.<br>BTW, the rechargeable version of the pen does attach magnetically to the Envy&#39;s sides, and it also has tilt recognition. Also, you can try one of the Ntrig based pens, like the Surface Pen, or Raphael Pen, since they all use the Microsoft Pen Protocol 2.0. <br>Hope to see more videos!

I actually bought this laptop for school but now i am wondering if i use a different pen than the hp one would the drawing experience actually improve or is it more like a problem with the laptop itself?

I just animate trashy stuff
What do you recommend for 3D work? (DAZ Studio in particular)
I have this laptop which I ordered thru HP&#39;s website. This laptop supports the new MPP 2.0 standard for the pen.  But the pen they will send you at no extra charge is HP&#39;s old pen.  But for $30 more, you can upgrade to their new pen that does support MPP 2.0.

I’m digging the new music tracks you’ve been using!
When you review tab s7+ can you try the windows sidecar thingy and draw on photoshop or windows apps , thanks











Yo estaría feliz de tener es laptop con equipo principal. Tiene mucha versatilidad, performance aceptable y un precio competitivo.
AMD Ryzen is actually better than its Intel counterpart for mobile devices, like laptop.<br>Here&#39;s a video comparing similarly priced (200 dollars more expensive) Intel laptop with this laptop. Didn&#39;t look good for Intel.<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V3uB12mRrU</a>


looks neat
Brad, you got the old pen. The latest pen from HP for their 2020 product is HP MPP2.0 Tilt Pen. The pen tip will look like Apple Pencil tip.


































More reviews of windows all in ones
&#39;Does it stack up against Intel&#39; How biased can you get? Intels performance is absolute garbage compared to Ryzen for productivity.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHUmm5xOQdg&amp;t=5m58s">5:58</a> that sound going was a bit sudden
Lol I have an HP Spectre x360 15 from 2018 and it&#39;s actually phenomenal for drawing. It has its shortcomings like you say. With the wobbley-woos. But with some stabilisation, it&#39;s manageable.




Ryzen series is better than the intel competition in the price point and even out performs some i7(s). GO FOR the Ryzen. 5 4600u it&#39;s so much better and future proofs your device longer than the Ryzen 3 4300u. If you can afford ryzen 7 4700u is like godspeed if you want something really powerful. And If you don&#39;t have the budget go for the Ryzen 3 it ain&#39;t that bad


















I haven&#39;t had an HP laptop since 2010. That laptop died from a motherboard design flaw that was common with the laptop model. I found out some time later that there was some kind of lawsuit against HP regarding that. Since then, I&#39;ve stayed away from the brand. Lately, though, after playing around with a few laptops at Best Buy, I&#39;ve come to feel their hardware has ticked up a bit in quality since my last experience. Still hesitant to buy another HP, though.



Cowboy? Really Brad, really?


Go for ryzen 5 4600u It&#39;s the best option for value
Can you use another pen instead of the default one? that works better?




Wow, Brad is SPEEEEEEEDY
Awsome!
Nice work! Please continue to review windows devices to draw on.
Cool
Everything looks pretty cheap in there but not in Indonesia

Is it good for animation
Was his Name always Brad Cowboy or was I just imagining Colbow was his last name



2 videos week comes back !<br><b>&quot;Noice&quot;</b>

Omg I literally just got this computer for art





































































Wait, I thought your name was &quot;Brad Colbow&quot;. Why is the channel name &quot;Brad Cowboy&quot; now lololol <br>Anyways, I always wanted your perspective on the HP Envy x360 and its pen experience, and I&#39;m so glad I got it now!

"like there's two versions of this"
"there's a cheaper one"
"that's only 250 nits but if you spend 80"
"dollars more"
"you get this one here it's 16x9 and i"
"feel like this would have been a good"
"opportunity for hp to incorporate"
"a 16 by 10 display instead but"
"it's not a bad panel like it gets close"
"to 400 nits of brightness the color"
"gamut's good"
"and i feel a lot of people spending the"
"extra money on the more expensive one"
"will have a good display for design work"
"now since the speakers are on the top of"
"the deck if you're curious how it sounds"
"i'm compared to the surface laptop 4"
"and you guys let me know which one"
"sounds better"
"[Music]"
"now the price on this is a thousand and"
"thirty nine dollars at least the review"
"unit that i have here but i think it's"
"pretty fair considering it's packing the"
"latest"
"ryzen 5000 cpu with 16 gigabytes of ram"
"and a 512 gigabyte nvme"
"ssd like if you're doing anything"
"multi-core related"
"this thing absolutely screams like if"
"you're some sort of developer"
"and you're compiling code then this"
"thing is going to be absolutely awesome"
"to use"
"the one area that it kind of does suffer"
"in is when you're doing anything in the"
"adobe suite"
"like intel processors paired with their"
"iris xe"
"still give you better results but most"
"cpu related tasks has an advantage on"
"these amd"
"processors now when it comes to heat"
"management it does pretty good"
"like i tested this out on balanced and"
"performance mode when you're using"
"balanced mode"
"it keeps the cpu temps under 80 degrees"
"celsius but you get a nerf in clock"
"speeds the advantage to this is you get"
"a very quiet"
"laptop under 40 decibels or around 40"
"decibels of noise"
"when you kick it onto performance mode"
"it gets a little hot it goes up to 90"
"degrees but it doesn't do this for a"
"very long period of time"
"the fans will be louder it will slightly"
"go over 40 decibels but you're able to"
"push this thing"
"a bit more yes i think hp could have"
"been more aggressive with the tuning"
"but most people are just using this for"
"every day and i think"
"they value fan noise a little bit more"
"than having the maximum performance"
"now thankfully a lot of the regular"
"stuff you'd expect"
"is upgradable like there's one slot for"
"an nvme ssd"
"and you can swap this out for something"
"bigger the other thing is the ram"
"this is not soldered onto the"
"motherboard so if you want to put more"
"ram in here down the road"
"you have the option to do so and i"
"always love seeing"
"two fans on an ultrabook i know a lot of"
"companies"
"tend to use only one but even with just"
"an integrated gpu like this one"
"two fans do a better job of keeping this"
"thing cool you have your swappable wi-fi"
"six card"
"and then you have a 51 watt hour battery"
"which gets me about 11 hours and 44"
"minutes of use"
"before needing to charge so here's the"
"thing the hp envy 15"
"x 360 is obviously not perfect but i"
"don't have a ton of complaints"
"yes i do wish the screen was 16 by 10. i"
"do wish the keyboard was more tactile"
"and obviously the hinges should be a bit"
"tighter"
"but for the price for an envy being"
"aimed towards budget to more"
"mid-range users i think they nailed the"
"most important things"
"fantastic performance great battery life"
"and low fan noise like when you're"
"running this under full load"
"it's not going to bother you or the"
"people surrounding you"
"so yeah if you're interested in checking"
"this out or have any more questions let"
"me know in the comment section down"
"below"
"also if you're interested in any of"
"those best buy deals there'll be links"
"in the description"
"if you want to check them out like the"
"video if you liked it subscribe if you"
"haven't already and i'll see you guys"
"in the next one"
"[Music]"
"what's up youtube"
"how goes it so you may remember several"
"weeks ago i actually did a review on"
"hp's mid-range hp laptop 15 and that"
"review kind of left a bitter taste in my"
"mouth when it comes to hp"
"products that laptop was not good at all"
"for various reasons"
"if you are interested in checking a"
"review out i'll leave a link in the"
"description below"
"for your own reference however with that"
"being said i figured i'd give hp another"
"chance but this time in their higher end"
"premium market so for today"
"we're actually reviewing the hp envy"
"x360 two in one 15-inch laptop"
"this bad boy has been refreshed with the"
"latest tiger lake processor"
"it's got a lot to offer and we're going"
"to see in this review"
"if it lives up to its hype and"
"expectations or if it's going to be"
"another disappointment by hp"
"whatever the case we're definitely going"
"to try to answer the question if it's"
"worth it for"
"you guys so as always guys if you enjoy"
"the content"
"hit that like button consider"
"subscribing to my channel we got all"
"kinds of awesome quality content here"
"thank you so much for watching without"
"further ado let's get started starting"
"off with a super quick"
"unboxing so the very first thing you're"
"going to notice of course"
"is that there's a very nice sleek modern"
"black cardboard box here"
"with the hp envy graphics i'm glad to"
"see hp put priority around premium"
"packaging"
"once you remove the content seal itself"
"and proceed to actually open the box"
"you're going to find a number of items"
"first and foremost of course"
"our laptop tightly wrapped in plastic"
"wrapping"
"once you remove the wrapping itself"
"inside here it is in a nice"
"metallic silver color looks pretty sleek"
"to be honest but we'll come back to the"
"laptop in just a second"
"beyond that you're going to find you"
"have another white box inside this white"
"box the first thing you have is a 65"
"watt charging adapter unfortunately it's"
"proprietary honestly it's becoming"
"shameful how a"
"high-end laptop is using a cheap"
"proprietary charging adapter as opposed"
"to a usbc adapter"
"they could really learn a thing or two"
"from the dell xps 13 or the new macbooks"
"of course with that being said you do"
"also get a wall outlet cable for the"
"adapter"
"and inside you have a smaller black box"
"inside this stylish black box you have"
"the hp stylus i can't remember the exact"
"name for it"
"i'll put in the description however and"
"it looks pretty nice"
"it's also matching with the color it's"
"made of hard tpu we'll come back to this"
"in a second as well"
"and that's pretty much all the important"
"things inside the box"
"next let's talk about the design of this"
"laptop so this is a pretty heavy laptop"
"weighing just"
"over 4.2 pounds keep in mind of course"
"firstly this is a 15 inch laptop"
"and secondly this is technically a two"
"in one and not a ultra book"
"of course with that being said hp has"
"used a nice mix of standard and premium"
"materials"
"and this laptop definitely looks premium"
"and it feels premium as well for the"
"most part"
"starting off at the top side of the"
"laptop you have this nice smooth"
"metallic finish"
"there's no particular texture which i"
"kind of like it seems to be a growing"
"trend with premium laptops"
"any dead center you have this super"
"stylish hp"
"logo it looks more modern more sleek i'm"
"digging it"
"and that's pretty much it for the top"
"side on the rear side of the laptop you"
"can tell this is a pretty thick laptop"
"from a height perspective"
"you also notice you have the hp envy"
"branding on one of the hinges"
"and in the center area is where you have"
"your outtake vent this is where all the"
"hot air basically comes out of from the"
"laptop"
"as you make your way to the side of the"
"laptop io port diversity is definitely"
"less than ideal"
"so on one side you have a headphone jack"
"a"
"usb a port you also have a hdmi port"
"and yes you do have a usbc port with"
"power transmission capabilities"
"on the other side you have that hideous"
"proprietary charging jack and of course"
"you also have"
"another usb 3.0 port and lastly you do"
"have a full-sized"
"sd card reader which is a nice touch"
"finally as we get to the bottom of the"
"laptop"
"i again have to appreciate hp's"
"consistency in terms of quality here"
"the bottom of the laptop actually also"
"has a metallic finish"
"you have this nice large vent this is of"
"course for air intake and if you look"
"carefully you'll notice on either side"
"of the laptop"
"you have a speaker grille this of course"
"is for the bang"
"olufsen stereo speaker setup we will by"
"the way do a sound test later on in the"
"video"
"so make sure you stay tuned for that as"
"you unfold the laptop"
"you'll notice a few things first and"
"foremost you have this nice metallic"
"finish here as well which is the same"
"color as the rest of the body"
"also you'll notice that you have a"
"reasonable amount of camera space"
"while it's not the most i've seen on a"
"15-inch laptop it is well within the"
"acceptability threshold"
"also you'll notice you have a pretty"
"large track pad that actually looks"
"really sleek and modern"
"with a glass surface unfortunately the"
"minute you actually start clicking on"
"this trackpad"
"it's less than ideal quality the clicks"
"are flimsy"
"the trackpad tends to off-balance a"
"little bit if you click on one corner or"
"the other"
"so why i wouldn't say it's terrible it"
"doesn't meet"
"the looks it portrays so you know"
"there's a little quality gap here"
"next up we make our way to the keyboard"
"and i have to be honest the keyboard"
"here is pretty decent in quality"
"so it's not flimsy or loose in the"
"slightest the keys look like they're"
"well made"
"and definitely match with the rest of"
"the laptop unfortunately i find there's"
"a less than ideal key travel i would"
"appreciate a little bit more key travel"
"which would end result give me a more"
"tactile feel but some people might"
"actually appreciate the more soft touch"
"nature of this keyboard it's gonna come"
"down to preference"
"you also have the inclusion of a full"
"size 10 key number pad"
"and yes the keyboard is fully backlit"
"the backlighting is pretty strong"
"also you do not have any dedicated media"
"keys"
"they are all integrated into the"
"traditional function keyset"
"so there's that you also have the power"
"button which is kind of meshing with the"
"rest of the keyboard i personally like"
"having dedicated power buttons"
"but again that's more of an aesthetics"
"preference also near the aero case at"
"the bottom of the keyboard"
"you'll notice you have a dedicated"
"fingerprint sensor"
"so awkwardly placed however it looks"
"pretty sleek past the keyboard itself"
"you'll notice you have this nice"
"large mesh grille this is not a speaker"
"grille"
"those are located on either corner of"
"the laptop towards the bottom side"
"this is actually a passive cooling vent"
"and more of a design"
"choice also directly above that you'll"
"notice you have a two tier"
"hinge system so you have one inch on"
"either side and this is a really well"
"built hinge"
"i found for the most part it's super"
"sturdy it doesn't wobble too much"
"and it has to be sturdy because this"
"laptop can technically rotate 360"
"degrees"
"and turn into a hybrid tablet so of"
"course that quality is expected"
"as you make your way to the actual"
"display fitting you'll notice you have"
"super thin bezels that are more or less"
"in line with 2021 standards"
"a relatively thin chin on the top side"
"you have"
"another laptop with another mediocre"
"720p webcam"
"thankfully it's not any worse than the"
"competition but unfortunately it's not"
"any better either"
"if you're using it in low light"
"condition lord have mercy on you let's"
"talk about the display quality"
"i don't know what it is with a lot of"
"these premium laptop makers"
"but when it comes to making laptops for"
"creative users"
"it's like they don't know who their"
"target audience even is so"
"the display quality here isn't"
"inherently bad it's just not good"
"considering this is a premium laptop"
"so you have a full hd 1080p screen which"
"in itself is not bad the resolution is"
"clear and sharp enough"
"where things start getting very"
"depressing very quickly is when you come"
"to the color accuracy"
"so you only have a 45 ntsc screen"
"in other words you only have a 67 s rgb"
"rating"
"so colors don't look washed out but they"
"don't look vivid either and if you are a"
"power creative user doing a lot of photo"
"editing color grading or video editing"
"you're definitely going to notice those"
"lackluster colors also"
"you only have a peak brightness of 250"
"nits"
"this is a hybrid laptop versatile laptop"
"whatever you want to call it"
"the fact is that 250 nits is not even"
"closely sufficient for an"
"outdoor setting where the sun is at your"
"screen it's gonna feel washed out this"
"is only sufficient for indoor settings"
"i don't know what they were thinking"
"when they made this display in terms of"
"brightness and color accuracy"
"but this is definitely one of the most"
"disappointing elements of this laptop"
"next up let's talk about performance so"
"from a specifications perspective this"
"particular configuration is rocking"
"intel's latest 11th generation"
"core f5 1135 g7 processor"
"we've also got 8 gigabytes of ddr4 ram"
"clocked at 3 200 megahertz"
"of course we also have a one terabyte"
"salsa drive"
"and lastly yes we do have intel iris xc"
"graphics"
"with a total of 4gb shared memory it's"
"also worth noting you do have the latest"
"wi-fi 6 and bluetooth standard on board"
"so day-to-day performance is going to"
"feel as snappy as it should with any"
"modern day laptop"
"documents open up super fast web"
"browsers are responsive and of course"
"you can watch any"
"of your favorite netflix or youtube"
"videos without any sort of lag"
"in short of you having a crappy internet"
"connection so"
"that's going to feel pretty normal where"
"things of course get interesting is when"
"you start doing more"
"resource intensive tasks let's say video"
"editing for example"
"i was pretty impressed with this laptop"
"it keeps it's cool when you're doing"
"1080p video editing on adobe rush"
"there's no frame drop whatsoever it's a"
"very smooth experience"
"even when you start doing more intensive"
"4k video editing"
"you'll still find relatively for the"
"most part there's little to no frame"
"drop"
"it's only when you're doing it for"
"prolonged periods of time you start"
"noticing the occasional performance drop"
"but beyond that it's pretty well done"
"from a gaming perspective"
"this laptop is about what you'd expect"
"so the intel iris xc chip can only"
"produce"
"so much power because it's an integrated"
"gpu not a dedicated one"
"which basically means you can run most"
"aaa titles but don't expect them to run"
"beyond 30 fps"
"at low settings if you're gonna use the"
"native resolution also"
"some games may actually go beyond that"
"but again it'll depend on the game"
"you're playing and how well it's"
"optimized"
"and i know there's a subset of you who"
"want to know the temperatures on this"
"thing"
"so if you're gonna use this thing like a"
"wild horse under peak stress you can"
"expect a"
"maximum surface temperature of 47"
"degrees celsius"
"however under more realistic and"
"moderate usage conditions"
"the surface temperature hovers around 35"
"to 37 degrees celsius"
"and if you are using a low workload or"
"if you're keeping it in idle conditions"
"then the temperature actually stays"
"below 23 degrees celsius which is pretty"
"comfortable"
"so while the temperatures aren't absurd"
"yes this laptop can get pretty hot"
"pretty quickly"
"if you start doing exotic things for"
"prolonged periods"
"from a battery life perspective this"
"laptop isn't that impressive"
"so basically if you are doing day-to-day"
"tasks with a moderate workload at 50"
"brightness you can get up to 8.5"
"hours of battery life however we found"
"that if you increase the brightness to"
"100"
"with a moderate workload that quickly"
"drops to around 5.5 hours"
"and if you start doing more cpu"
"intensive stuff and you have a heavy"
"workload non-stop"
"the battery life can drop to as little"
"as 1.5"
"hours so it's a pretty dramatic drop so"
"keep in mind if you're buying this"
"laptop for all day usage"
"this might not be the best option in"
"that regards from a sound perspective"
"this laptop sounds pretty good to be"
"honest"
"the bang and often stereo setup is"
"actually better than i thought it would"
"be"
"but have a quick listen for yourself you"
"be the judge"
"[Music]"
"[Applause]"
"[Music]"
"the final element i want to talk about"
"is the touchscreen and the hp stylus"
"given the fact this is a convertible"
"twin one laptop"
"we have to keep in mind that it is also"
"intended to be used as a tablet"
"with that being said the stylus hd"
"provides is pretty high in quality it's"
"actually charged through"
"a usb-c port which is ironic because hp"
"uses a proprietary charging port"
"for their laptop take notes from your"
"own products hp seriously"
"of course with that being said i have to"
"say that it's super responsive"
"there's practically no lag or latency"
"between what you're writing and what's"
"appearing on the screen itself"
"and yes you can use the touchscreen with"
"your fingers as well generally speaking"
"i think this is"
"a great hybrid tablet even though the"
"display quality is not that good"
"the responsiveness of the touchscreen is"
"on the contrary quite"
"amazing so what's my final take on this"
"laptop well priced at 1050 usd"
"this is a two-in-one laptop that's"
"competing in the premium market"
"and in terms of the feel and design of"
"this laptop it's top notch the build"
"quality is definitely there"
"and i really like how hp is trying their"
"best to make a premium experience over"
"here"
"also the fantastic keyboard is a welcome"
"addition"
"i also appreciate the high quality sound"
"system from bangin olsen here"
"it definitely sounds a notch above your"
"average laptop"
"unfortunately the less than ideal"
"borderline disappointing display"
"is not good for many people if you are a"
"creative user"
"you may be entirely driven away from"
"that less than ideal color accuracy"
"again"
"also the battery life is not that good"
"in itself eight hours of average usage"
"time at 50 brightness"
"is nothing to write home about so if you"
"are looking for all-day usage here this"
"laptop"
"is not the ideal choice also it's worth"
"noting it would have been nice if"
"hp included more i o port diversity"
"while it's not the worst i've seen on"
"laptops in this class this is a 15-inch"
"laptop"
"there was definitely space to add an"
"additional port or two"
"overall this laptop isn't a bad value"
"it's just that it's going to be very"
"specific for the type of audience it's"
"targeted at"
"which is ironic because a lot of"
"creative users might eye it for its"
"hybrid tablet"
"capabilities but that display quality"
"may at the same time turn them away"
"so use it at your own discretion try it"
"out see if it's the right one for you"
"but overall my take is if you are"
"someone who relies heavily on color"
"accuracy"
"don't go for this laptop but if you are"
"someone looking for versatility"
"and you want a nice hybrid tablet that's"
"good in build quality and justifies the"
"premium price"
"this is definitely a laptop for you as"
"always guys"
"if you enjoyed this review consider"
"subscribing to my channel i got all"
"sorts of awesome tech content thank you"
"so much for watching this video"
"i'll catch you in the next one soul tech"
"logging out"
"historically speaking hp envy's x360"
"series has kind of been like glaze's"
"plain salted flavor so it doesn't have a"
"ton of punch to it but yet everyone"
"loves it and this is one of the most"
"popular two-in-one laptops on the market"
"now of course today we have the latest"
"iteration the 2022 version of the hp"
"envy x360 laptop and as you might have"
"guessed it's rocking the list intel"
"internals for example we have in this"
"particular base configuration the i5"
"1240p processor eight gigabytes of ddr4"
"memory in a dual channel configuration"
"we have the latest generation of intel"
"iris xc integrated graphics a 512"
"gigabyte software drive we also have a"
"wi-fi 60 and bluetooth 5.2 standards on"
"board and finally this is a 15-inch"
"fully touch captive display now as"
"always there's a lot to talk about with"
"this laptop it's a fully loaded review"
"so let me know what you think at the end"
"of the video thanks for watching let's"
"get started now i would love to show you"
"what the face of this actual package"
"looks like but the shipping company"
"massacred it with stickers all over the"
"place and i just don't have the patience"
"to use google to remove all of them but"
"in any case it's a nice looking box once"
"you remove the content seals and open"
"the box up inside you'll find a few"
"items first and foremost the laptop"
"itself loaded with a ton of harmful"
"protective plastic packaging but anyway"
"once you remove all of that here we have"
"the hp envy x360 looks somewhat similar"
"to last year but still very modern and"
"sleek now past that you have a standard"
"65 watt charging adapter unfortunately"
"you still have a charging pin as opposed"
"to a usb-c pin my heart is a little"
"broken not gonna lie now past that you"
"do have another standard wall outlet"
"charging cable piece which of course is"
"required to power the adapter and past"
"that you do get in the box the hp mpp"
"2.0 stylus and once you open this thing"
"i'm a huge fan of the stylus it's really"
"lightweight it's elegant yet practical"
"it comes with two tips and it has usbc"
"charging which is great of course and"
"finally you have this paper envelope"
"here inside you will find the quick"
"start guide warranty and regulation"
"information if you're expecting a lot of"
"design changes well you're not going to"
"get those here the hp envy x360 still"
"looks very similar to last year's model"
"you still have those sharp linear edges"
"a high quality metallic exterior finish"
"and of course those wide dimensions now"
"it's not necessarily a bad thing it's"
"still a very modern design but again"
"it's not going gonna look very distinct"
"from 2021 models with that said this"
"laptop does have a overall weight of"
"about four pounds making it one of the"
"more heavier 15-inch productivity"
"laptops in the market now of course the"
"good news over here is that starting"
"with the top side like i mentioned you"
"have a high quality metallic finish it's"
"smooth it's textureless it just feels"
"really nice and one of my favorite parts"
"is that really subtle hp branding they"
"have in the center it just looks really"
"premium and i'm a big fan of it the size"
"of the laptop is where you'll find all"
"the i o ports so on one side you have a"
"usb a super speed port with reverse"
"charging functionality you also have a"
"modern hdmi 2.1 port a speedy"
"thunderbolt 4 port that has power"
"delivery and displayport functionality"
"you also of course have a good old"
"headphone jack now on the other side you"
"will find one more usb-a super speed"
"port you also of course have the dc jack"
"to plug the actual laptop and finally"
"you have a dedicated full-size sd card"
"reader while the standards could have"
"included at least one more thunderbolt 4"
"port overall io port diversity is pretty"
"decent on this machine the bottom side"
"of the laptop has changed a little bit"
"so you still have that high quality"
"metallic finish but you will notice you"
"have a considerably wider air intake"
"vent over here which is always good news"
"for the most part because that means"
"it'll ultimately be a cooler laptop you"
"will notice hp also got rid of the fancy"
"nv style design speaker grilles and"
"replace them with more well standard"
"looking ones i guess that's not a bad"
"thing in terms of performance i did like"
"the old design better and yes of course"
"this is a stereo speaker setup sound"
"test to follow later on in the video as"
"soon as you unfold this laptop you"
"appreciate the amount of palm rest space"
"you have but that is expected with a"
"large 15-inch laptop like this what you"
"will appreciate also is the massive"
"track pad you have here you have a lot"
"of surf real estate space and it's"
"appropriately put in a laptop of this"
"class unfortunately quality isn't all"
"that good for example you have a plastic"
"surface finish this is a premium laptop"
"it should have a glass surface trackpad"
"on top of that while the clicks are"
"tactile there is a moderate amount of"
"flex on either the right or left bottom"
"corners and the calibration isn't all"
"that good either generally speaking i"
"was expecting a considerably better"
"crack pad given this is technically a"
"premium laptop on a lighter note the"
"keyboard is pretty good so you'll notice"
"you have large keycaps with plenty of"
"surface area it's well labeled it's"
"fully backlit and the overall quality of"
"the typing experience is also very nice"
"you have tactile keystrokes and you also"
"have plenty of key travel but you also"
"appreciate the fact that it's not a very"
"loud keyboard it's great for a"
"productive or office environment now you"
"do have a built-in fingerprint scanner"
"right next to the arrow keys one thing i"
"absolutely despise about this keyboard"
"is the lack of a 10 keypad which could"
"have been easily accommodated if hp"
"would finally get rid of these pseudo"
"grilles they don't cool the laptop nor"
"are these speakers in fact they don't"
"really serve any major purpose and"
"getting rid of them would just allow you"
"to fit more practical things like a 10"
"keypad again so definitely knocking off"
"a full star for that the hinge quality"
"on this laptop is in fact top notch"
"which is a requirement for any good"
"convertible laptop it doesn't have a lot"
"of wobble it's sturdy it has the right"
"amount of calibration to keep it tight"
"but not so tight that it might be a"
"problem in the long term overall it"
"should do great in the years to come now"
"display fitting you have a screen to"
"body ratio of about 88"
"which isn't bad and you'll notice you do"
"have somewhat of a thick chin at the"
"bottom but the bezels in contrast are"
"relatively narrow you also have a pretty"
"thin forehead at the top what is quite"
"shameful of course is that miserable"
"720p webcam you can toss your dreams of"
"looking good on this laptop right out"
"the window because honestly it's just"
"weird how they're still okay with"
"putting a"
"non-full hd webcam in 2022 on a premium"
"laptop the display oh the display so"
"think of it this way imagine having a"
"really modern sleek looking car but when"
"you sit inside the dashboard looks like"
"it's straight from the 1980s that's"
"right that's how i feel about this"
"display so starting off with the"
"somewhat good stuff you do have a"
"standard full hd or 1080p resolution a"
"60 hertz refresh rate a 16 9 aspect"
"ratio a high quality ips panel that"
"actually has amazing viewing angles and"
"no pwm flickering detected it doesn't"
"sound so bad until now additionally you"
"also have a multi-touch 10-point system"
"and i gotta tell you the mpp 2.0 stylus"
"is actually amazing it practically has"
"no lag or latency it's great to type"
"with the tip is of high quality and it"
"just feels like a very smooth experience"
"overall but here's where things start"
"getting really bad really fast you have"
"a 45 ntsc color rating or approximately"
"56 percent srgb colors look poor washed"
"out and anyone who needs high degree of"
"color accuracy will not be happy with"
"this display but the real crime here is"
"that you have a display that attracts so"
"much glitter because of its reflective"
"surface and you only have 250 nits to"
"compensate for that basically you cannot"
"use this thing in any bright daylight"
"setting whatsoever period it's just"
"shameful how there's laptops that cost"
"500 less than this display and they have"
"a better color and often a better"
"brightness rating than this laptop it's"
"just not acceptable for a premium laptop"
"now there is a saving grace to this"
"laptop and that's its general"
"performance so you can get this in"
"either a i5 or i7 12th gen configuration"
"and depending which one you get you get"
"8 or 16 gigabytes of ram respectively"
"for the base configuration here"
"day-to-day tasks like web browsing"
"watching videos typing up documents work"
"in a very smooth and predictable way"
"even more demanding activities like"
"photo editing or video editing are very"
"much doable even with the base"
"configuration now it is worth noting if"
"you are doing something as intense as 4k"
"video editing you definitely want to opt"
"for the 16 gigabyte configuration"
"because that 8gb very quickly becomes a"
"bottleneck and you will notice"
"occasional frame drops and just laggy"
"performance in general but again that's"
"more of a ram problem now as far as"
"gaming goes i was pleasantly surprised"
"because you can play modern games like"
"fortnite for example at medium settings"
"ranging somewhere between 30 to 60"
"frames per second and it's a passable"
"experience for casual gaming i'm a"
"pretty big fan of thermals on this"
"laptop so for example with this device"
"under unrealistic peak loads you can hit"
"a maximum surface temperature of"
"approximately 43 degrees celsius but"
"more realistic heavy loads will yield"
"you around 38 degrees celsius which is a"
"very manageable and reasonable number"
"fan noise is also pretty good for"
"example doing heavy loads will yield"
"you're around 40 decibels of noise level"
"if you really push the fan to its limit"
"it can go up to 43 decibels but this is"
"usually for brief periods of time and if"
"you're doing anything less than that the"
"fans hardly go on so generally speaking"
"great thermals as far as battery life is"
"concerned you can get approximately nine"
"hours of real-world usage non-benchmark"
"of course which basically means"
"activities like web browsing watching"
"youtube or netflix at about 1080p doing"
"light photo editing and even"
"occasionally using the speakers at"
"approximately forty percent volume and"
"all of this at fifty percent screen"
"brightness of course now another thing"
"worth noting is the speaker quality on"
"this laptop is decent but not great"
"given it's a bang and awesome stereo"
"speaker setup doesn't get as loud as i"
"thought it would but still it's a decent"
"experience have a quick listen for"
"yourself"

"with the 1100 starting price the hp envy"
"x360 definitely treads well into premium"
"laptop territory and at that price it"
"does give a lot but it also doesn't give"
"a lot at the exact same time so let's"
"look at the good stuff for example you"
"get top notch build quality with a high"
"quality metallic exterior finish you"
"also have a great keyboard coupled with"
"a high quality hinge a great two-in-one"
"function that's built into laptop you"
"also get hp's mpp 2.0 stylus right out"
"of the box and it's a high quality"
"stylus at that additionally you have"
"great performance with this laptop and"
"generally speaking thermals are quite"
"respectable now on the flip side hp just"
"does these little things that really"
"make you question if this is a premium"
"laptop like that low quality display a"
"45 ntsc rating is just unacceptable on a"
"laptop of this price and tier in general"
"also i don't appreciate the fact for"
"example that you have a standard hd"
"webcam or the fact that they've wasted"
"so much keyboard layout space and they"
"don't include a practical 10 keypad"
"those things definitely are factors of"
"consideration for a lot of people but if"
"you're willing to forgive those or"
"overgo those then this is still overall"
"a decent laptop in the premium category"
"overall let me know what you think of"
"this laptop i'd love to hear your"
"thoughts and make sure you subscribe and"
"hit that like button it genuinely helps"
"me a lot thanks for watching see in the"
"next one"
"Even with the knowledge of how good"
"the Zen 2 was on the desktop,"
"I was shocked at how well AMD's Ryzen 4000 series"
"mobile series performed."
"Asus' Zephyrus G14 shredded its Intel competitors"
"in both performance and battery life,"
"while also being considerably cheaper."
"Now it looks like HP hopes to recreate that success"
"with the Envy x360."
"And, spoiler alert,"
"they did."
"This thing sips power, yet it has six cores"
"and is $800 for a configuration"
"that we can actually recommend."
"What?"
"You know? Like, what?"
"Like, what's a segue?"
"GlassWire lets you keep track of the weird stuff"
"that's connecting to your PC,"
"even when you aren't using it."
"You can see if a strange device joins your Wi-Fi,"
"and block it instantly."
"Get 25% off by using code LINUS at the link below."
"(upbeat music)"
"Our config of the HP Envy x360 sports a Ryzen 5 4500U,"
"a 7-nanometer, 6-core, 6-thread processor"
"that boosts up to 4 gigahertz."
"The last 6-core Ultrabook we looked at"
"was the Dell XPS 13, a beast of a machine,"
"except that it costs a casual 1,800 U.S. dollars,"
"which is why we will not be comparing the Envy x360 to it."
"Instead, we'll be testing it against the HP Spectre x360"
"with an Intel Core i5-1035G4,"
"a 4-core, 8-thread CPU on Intel's newish 10-nanometer node"
"that you would hope would give the Ryzen 5"
"a run for its money, especially since it's in a machine"
"that costs (clears throat) $250 more."
"But that maximum boost speed of 3.7 gigahertz"
"isn't a good first sign."
"A much worse sign is the performance tests we ran."
"In multicore loads, the Ryzen 5 4500U"
"is set to shred the i5 with a 45% higher score in Cinebench."
"Like, I knew it was gonna win, just not by that much."
"And remember, guys, this isn't even"
"the top-spec 8-core model."
"Even more surprisingly, though, the 4500U"
"managed to dominate the single-threaded test as well,"
"thanks to that higher boost clock."
"Now, although I don't expect anyone"
"to be doing much hardcore gaming"
"on either of these machines, the Ryzen 5 4500U"
"was also 20% faster in 3DMark Time Spy,"
"and I'm never gonna complain about a bit more GPU muscle."
"Thermals, unfortunately,"
"didn't redeem the Core i5 version either."
"It immediately shot up to 100 degrees and stayed there,"
"managing clocks of only around 2.3 gigahertz,"
"something we might have accepted"
"if Intel was the only option in town because,"
"I mean, in fairness, that is at least faster"
"than the 1.5-gigahertz base clock."
"Thing is, Intel isn't the only option anymore,"
"and our Ryzen 5 config avoided thermal throttling,"
"albeit barely, at 91 degrees,"
"while keeping all six of its cores"
"at a whopping 3.3 gigahertz."
"Look how thin it is, guys! 3.3 gigahertz!"
"It's worth noting that you'll have to"
"enable performance mode to get these kind of speeds,"
"but they're truly remarkable."
"Remember that Dell XPS 13 with a 6-core i7"
"that I mentioned at the start of this video?"
"Yeah."
"In performance mode, this Ryzen machine"
"is faster than that too."
"The thing is, performance matters a lot less"
"than longevity in a thin-and-light"
"than it does in a gaming laptop,"
"and HP already has some of the best"
"battery life in the biz with their Intel Core i5 model,"
"managing nearly 13 hours on a single charge."
"That is gonna be hard to..."
"And the AMD Envy x360 made it almost 14 hours."
"That's the kinda battery life that not only"
"gets you through the day, but maybe even the weekend."
"Like, you could just leave the power brick at work,"
"without worrying that your lttstore.com browsing session"
"is gonna get cut short."
"- This is my whole weekend."
"- But that raises the question: Is this the kinda machine"
"that you'd wanna take home with you anyway?"
"One of AMD's big problems, for years now,"
"has been not getting their CPUs into the premium designs,"
"and this is no exception."
"The Envy line does sit below"
"the Spectre line in HP's lineups."
"So has HP given their Envy x360 enough love?"
"Or should you just save up a bit longer"
"for a Spectre x360 or an XPS 13?"
"Actually, I am pleased to report"
"that HP has committed no such crime against AMD here."
"The Envy x360 has a premium look about it,"
"from the super small bezels"
"to the metallic accents on the hinges."
"The chassis stiffness might not quite hold up"
"to top-tier laptops that are constructed out of carbon fiber"
"or a solid milled piece of aluminum,"
"but it's leagues better than a budget-focused machine"
"like Lenovo Flex 14."
"So I think it's fair to say that HP"
"really nailed the balance here."
"The only thing build quality-wise that annoyed me"
"was the screen, which wobbles a bit more than I'd like."
"But bearing in mind that, of course,"
"I've got that tablet-convertible trade-off, I can accept it."
"And the I/O is really good."
"The Envy x360 has two USB Type-A's"
"with the little hingey pull-down bit."
"Oh, it turns out you can put a Type-A in a superthin laptop."
"How nice!"
"It's got a Type C with charging,"
"and it's got an SD card reader."
"I do wish that, instead of the barrel power connector"
"on the right side, we got another USB Type-C port"
"with charging, but presumably,"
"that would've brought up the price,"
"and I think they found a great balance here."
"One place HP fortunately didn't cheap out is the display."
"With 300 nits of brightness and excellent colors,"
"I think anyone short of a professional photo editor"
"is gonna be pretty happy with it."
"My only complaint here is the 16x9 aspect ratio."
"These days, many of HP's competitors"
"are making the jump to 16x10 or even 3x2,"
"and this is even in the lower price ranges,"
"with the Acer Swift 3 leading the way."
"Get subscribed, by the way, so you don't miss our video"
"on that little number."
"Staying with 16x9 while chasing small bezels"
"has to be HP's most obvious error"
"with both the Envy and Spectre x360s,"
"because it means that some folks"
"are actually gonna struggle to use the devices comfortably."
"- There's just no way for me to type comfortably on this."
"My hands are just simply too big to rest on the palmrest,"
"making it, unfortunately, just a straight-up no-go for me."
"And it's going to be a no-go for 68% of males,"
"and half of females as well."
"I also constantly use my right thumb on the trackpad"
"while writing in Word documents,"
"and the fact that keyboard and the trackpad"
"aren't centered on each other means"
"that I'm only using a small portion of a trackpad"
"that's already very undersized by today's standards."
"To be clear, the switches are good,"
"but maybe try it out at a Best Buy or Costco first"
"to make sure that the ergonomics work for you."
"- If you are able to get comfortable, though,"
"you'll have an excellent time typing on the Envy x360."
"I personally didn't have an issue with my tiny hands,"
"and the switches offer plenty of travel"
"while delivering a satisfying snap when you press them."
"Key consistency and stabilization"
"was also uncharacteristically good"
"for a laptop in this price band,"
"so I don't think you're gonna have trouble"
"getting up to full speed."
"As for the trackpad, it's less of a highlight."
"The tracking is still pretty good"
"despite the lack of a glass top,"
"but the small size keeps it from being exceptional,"
"or even very good."
"You will be able to get used to it,"
"but I'd personally be much happier"
"with a bigger bottom bezel, or better yet,"
"a taller screen and a larger trackpad."
"Now, to be clear, there are a number of areas"
"where the Spectre x360 is superior to the Envy."
"Windows Hello facial recognition is a real-nice-to-have,"
"although the fingerprint reader on the Envy"
"is still quite snappy for logging in."
"And the Spectre also comes with a pen included,"
"with the option for LTE, which could easily sway"
"someone who is constantly on the go."
"But then again, if you're gonna be on the go,"
"with how much better the core performance"
"and battery life are here, I feel like until HP"
"puts an AMD processor into a Spectre notebook"
"they have unintentionally killed"
"their flagship lineup right here."
"For the vast majority of people, the HP Envy x360"
"is gonna check all of the important boxes for an ultrabook."
"It's super powerful, especially for the price,"
"it feels excellent in the hand,"
"and aside from the screen aspect ratio,"
"I just have no real complaints about it."
"I can't even remember the last time"
"that an ultrabook came through the studio here"
"that was under $1,200 and managed to get a full-blown,"
"no-caveats recommendation from me."
"But this one certainly does, and I hope"
"that as more companies take AMD's mobile chips seriously,"
"we're gonna see more excellent performers at great prices,"
"like this one."
"Speaking of excellent performance at a great price,"
"our sponsor Drop.com is featuring"
"the Koss GMR-54X-ISO gaming headset."
"It's audiophile-approved and based on"
"a popular Koss headset, and the custom-engineered acoustics"
"for immersive 3D sound allow you to get positional cues"
"to hear where your enemies are coming from."
"There are some changes made from the original,"
"including reduced tension in the lightweight headband"
"for extend comfort, and it includes a cord splitter,"
"inline microphone with remote, and a detachable boom mic."
"The boom mic works with the PlayStation 4,"
"Xbox and Nintendo Switch, and more, without hassle,"
"and you can grab yours today,"
"with new users who sign up on Drop.com"
"getting $20 off this headset."
"If you guys enjoyed this video"
"and you just can't get enough AMD domination,"
"check out our full review of the Asus Zephyrus G14."
"It really is a lesson on how to build"
"a compact high-performance gaming notebook."
"Put AMD in it. Ah, ha-ha, got 'em."
"so a little over a week ago I reviewed"
"the HP Envy X360 15-inch it came with an"
"AMD processor it was good but I didn't"
"love it because the display they were"
"using it was a pretty poor display but"
"this is the 13-inch version and for its"
"price of 11.79 you're getting a 2K plus"
"OLED display and it looks really good on"
"this laptop now personally I prefer this"
"form factor a 13 inch laptop even though"
"the display is smaller it's just a lot"
"easier to carry it's lighter and it's"
"better for travel HP is using a"
"magnesium alloy with a bunch of ocean"
"bound Plastics to help save the"
"environment and overall the quality and"
"feel to it feels pretty good now this is"
"the Bluer model it does get a lot of"
"fingerprints on the chassis the top lid"
"is a little bit flexible but it's not"
"terrible you have the HP logo in the"
"middle the ports are not too bad like on"
"the left hand side you have an audio"
"jack and then you have your micro SD"
"card slot you have a USB a port again"
"I'm not a fan of these flaps they do"
"break easy so as I always say these HP"
"videos be very very careful when you're"
"plugging in a USB peripheral on the"
"right hand side you have two Thunderbolt"
"4 ports and another USB a port now"
"unfortunately there's no RJ45 but what"
"it does have is Wi-Fi 6E which means I"
"got to test out my new Deco xe75 Pro"
"Wi-Fi 6E tri-band mesh system by tp-link"
"who was kind enough to partner on this"
"video the speeds can go up to 2.4"
"gigabits per second but since my"
"internet connection is only one gigabit"
"per second it had zero problems handling"
"it the first thing I noticed is how much"
"smoother my Wi-Fi experience has been"
"compared to my old system my studio is"
"in a commercial condo and I'm surrounded"
"by other Wi-Fi networks that use older"
"Legacy bands but since the Deco xe75 pro"
"has a six gigahertz band it does a much"
"better job of avoiding any interference"
"and also acts as a backhaul the design"
"is super clean and it connects up to 200"
"devices there's three Lan ports on the"
"back two one gigabits per second ports"
"and one 2.5 gigabit per second port for"
"multi-gig internet now I'm using the try"
"pack which can cover up to 7 200 square"
"feet but if that's a bit too much"
"coverage there's a two pack option as"
"well upgrading from Wi-Fi 5 to Wi-Fi 6E"
"is the best upgrade you can make for a"
"better wi-fi experience The Deco xc75"
"Pro is one of the most affordable and"
"fastest Wi-Fi 6E mesh systems you can"
"buy today right now you can get up to"
"100 off until October 16th links will be"
"in the description down below now"
"opening up the laptop is tough with one"
"hand because this is a convertible like"
"the display can flip 360 Degrees which"
"means they have to be a little bit more"
"stringent on the hinge make it a bit"
"more stiff since it's going to be"
"constantly being open the one thing I"
"noticed right away is that the hinge"
"quality on the 30 inch model is better"
"than the 15 inch version because the"
"display is not as big so there's just"
"less wobble when you open it up in fact"
"the wobble on this display is very"
"comparable to a normal clamshell laptop"
"so I was quite impressed when I opened"
"up this display the keyboard is very"
"comfortable to type on it's a little bit"
"mushy in the middle but the keys feel"
"fantastic there's a nice click sound to"
"it which I always appreciate it's good"
"travel distance and I had zero issues"
"getting used to typing on it you have a"
"nice quick shortcut key to the HP"
"Command Center if you want to quickly"
"put it in performance or quiet mode but"
"you can also do things like use camera"
"features that you know lighten up your"
"face a bit better by creating this like"
"ring on the screen that uses white light"
"and also adjusts the exposure the"
"trackpad is right in the middle it feels"
"very comfortable to use it's very"
"accurate so no complaints there and the"
"sticker placement is actually good for"
"once now the 2880 by 1800 OLED display"
"looks absolutely gorgeous it is using a"
"glass panel so it can be a little bit"
"reflective depending on the light"
"scenario brightness is pretty good color"
"accuracy is obviously fantastic contrast"
"ratios are through the roof overall a"
"great panel to look at there is a bit of"
"pwm flicker it is 60 hertz but that pwm"
"flicker doesn't kick in until about 40"
"percent and lower there's Windows hello"
"facial recognition to log you in but"
"there's no fingerprint scanner in case"
"you want to use something physical"
"there's a bit of bezel on the bottom but"
"overall the bezels are fairly thin on"
"the sides now performance has been"
"pretty solid like this is an i7 1250u"
"CPU it doesn't beat out the ryzen 7"
"version I tested in the 15 inch model"
"when it comes to synthetic benchmarks"
"but depending on what you're doing this"
"excels in some areas and the R7 excels"
"in others for example if you're doing"
"anything specifically CPU related like"
"Mozilla Firefox or compiling code then"
"the 15-inch ryzen version will be a bit"
"faster but if you're doing any sort of"
"video editing or creative work mostly"
"video editing where it needs to use that"
"integrated GPU then the 13 inch i7 1250u"
"is the better option now if you're just"
"doing General productivity it really"
"doesn't make a difference which process"
"you go with they both feel equally fast"
"and noise on this is really good right"
"now I have it on performance mode and"
"that gets up to about 43 to 45 decibels"
"but if you put it on balanced or quiet"
"mode you can get the fan noise to go"
"down below 40. heat management is also"
"fantastic I had no issues it does"
"obviously power throttle when the CPU"
"gets a bit too hot clock speeds tend to"
"stay a bit higher on the 15 inch model"
"just due to the bigger chassis but the"
"13 inch version performs very well for"
"everyday tasks now it does have two"
"speakers on the bottom it sounds good"
"but obviously not as good as front"
"firing speakers but everything was nice"
"and clear and there was no Distortion at"
"max volume now internally not much is"
"upgradable you do have a swappable nvme"
"SSD and a swappable Wi-Fi 6E card Ram is"
"soldered onto the motherboard you have"
"one copper heat pipe to cool the CPU and"
"integrated GPU plus a 66 watt hour"
"battery that gave me pretty good battery"
"life honestly for the price 11.79 I"
"think this is a pretty good deal not"
"only do you get a 2880 by 1800 OLED"
"display but you also get the pen"
"included in the Box I think the build"
"quality is slightly better than the"
"15-inch version just because the hinges"
"do a better job on a 13 inch display and"
"the i7 paired with a very fast nvme SSD"
"make this a great choice if you're"
"buying this for work or even back to"
"school if you're interested in checking"
"it out I'll Place links in the"

"my never ending search for an all-in-one"
"windows laptop that i can also"
"draw in has led me to this this is the"
"hp"
"envy x360 13 with an amd"
"processor can this be my budget windows"
"art machine of my dreams let's find out"
"hello my name is brad i review tech for"
"creative professionals and as you all"
"know when it comes to drawing tech"
"things can get"
"pretty pricey when a budget alternative"
"pops up there always seems to be a catch"
"the surface go looks really"
"cool but it's underpowered there's some"
"super cheap 200"
"android tablets out there but eh they're"
"kind of janky and i've been looking for"
"that sweet spot the place where"
"good price meets a good drawing"
"experience and today that search brings"
"me here the hp envy"
"x360 this is an all-in-one windows"
"convertible"
"laptop the screen flips up all the way"
"around so you can set it up and"
"draw on it using the included pen"
"unfortunately and we're just gonna get"
"the bad news out of the way here at the"
"beginning the pen isn't as good as i was"
"hoping it would be but when you factor"
"in the price"
"it might be a trade-off that you're"
"willing to make to have a small"
"portable nice little windows laptop"
"let's take a look at what we've got in"
"the box we've got our power brick and"
"also the extension cable that plugs into"
"it"
"also we have the pen included also that"
"comes with the battery right here in the"
"box"
"you can upgrade it and get a"
"rechargeable version of this pen for 30"
"dollars more"
"that pen will charge via usb then we"
"have the laptop"
"itself it looks pretty nice it's got"
"this nice brushed metal look it's a it's"
"a darker color it's not"
"ultra light in fact it weighs a good"
"amount but it's solid"
"it feels premium hp has made laptops"
"like this before but what makes this"
"particular one special is it's the amd"
"version the product i am checking out"
"here is the entry level configuration"
"that starts out at 650"
"dollars it's got a 13.3 full hd that's"
"1920 by 1080 screen"
"you could jump up to a 15 inch model"
"which has the same resolution"
"but a couple more ports in it on these"
"smaller screens especially a 13 inch"
"screen not having that higher resolution"
"doesn't really bother me much it looks"
"pretty good and it gets plenty bright at"
"300 nits"
"the viewing angles of the screen are"
"just okay for every position i was in"
"for drawing or using a laptop"
"it was just fine but when i got to"
"filming it i could really"
"see that when you get off to the side or"
"move it around"
"it gets kind of dark this is also a"
"touch enabled screen it's great for"
"pinching and zooming but also"
"the occasional accidental palm mark more"
"on that in a minute also worth pointing"
"out is this screen is a 16 by nine"
"aspect ratio inside we have 256"
"gigabyte ssd which is more than i"
"expected at this price point"
"like i mentioned before this one is"
"rocking an amd ryzen 3"
"4 300 u processor if you wanted to spec"
"this out with a better ryzen processor"
"like the 5 or the 7"
"you can do that too i'm not a benchmark"
"kind of guy but what i wanted to see"
"with this amd ryzen processor was"
"is it too slow for drawing an"
"illustration task does it stack up that"
"way"
"against intel and i'm happy to report it"
"ran adobe photoshop and the creative"
"suite"
"just fine probably not something i'd"
"want to do video editing on but for"
"illustration it was great this model"
"also comes with eight gigabytes of"
"memory built in or if you're an artist"
"or illustrator that's usually the base"
"point i tell most people to shoot for"
"when you're looking at a laptop is you"
"wanna go"
"eight gigabytes or higher you probably"
"don't wanna go under that and there's"
"some more good news here if you got a"
"phillips head screwdriver you could open"
"up the back pretty easily and install"
"more ram down the road if you need to"
"on the left side we have a headphone"
"jack a usb a port and a usb"
"c port that is not thunderbolt 3. in"
"this case"
"that's because we're rocking some amd"
"internals not intel on the right side we"
"have a power port another usb a port and"
"also"
"a micro sd card slot i've seen photos of"
"these before but the usb"
"a ports are the kind that kind of flap"
"open to make the laptop center i thought"
"that was kind of cool and you can make"
"it talk"
"hi i should also point out if you"
"upgrade to that 15-inch version of this"
"laptop there's more ports"
"for example it adds an hdmi port along"
"the side as well there aren't a lot of"
"bells and whistles to this"
"budget-friendly laptop so"
"things like the camera it's only a 720p"
"camera it's only okay but they did"
"manage to fit in"
"a kill switch for that camera and also a"
"fingerprint reader on the keyboard the"
"battery on this thing was pretty good"
"hp rates it about 12 hours of battery"
"life"
"i would say drawing in photoshop i was"
"getting closer to around"
"six hours which is decent windows"
"laptops have come a long way"
"in recent years the low end laptops feel"
"a lot more premium now than they used to"
"this keyboard feels pretty good to type"
"on the all aluminum body gives it a more"
"premium feel in general and even the"
"speakers sound good"
"the speaker grilles are along the bottom"
"of the laptop so"
"it's a bit muffled in laptop mode"
"because of that but it sounds really"
"good when you prop it up for drawing"
"because"
"the speakers are now facing you speaking"
"of drawing the angles on this are pretty"
"good"
"when you flip it around you're probably"
"going to want to hold it with one hand"
"since it is a laptop putty the pull"
"pressure of your palm is gonna close the"
"thing but i found it was pretty"
"comfortable to rest my hand along the"
"side"
"while drawing on it and propping it at"
"the angle i wanted to use it at and that"
"360 degree hinge"
"holds up pretty well that's something"
"that i worry about the most on these"
"laptops is i have"
"no idea what that hinge is going to be"
"like two years from now one thing i did"
"miss is there's no real place to put the"
"pen there's nowhere to store it on the"
"inside there's no magnets in the pen or"
"along the side of the screen so you"
"could stick the pen to it"
"the pen just kind of is there another"
"thing to be aware of is the fan"
"tended to be on when i was drawing on"
"this thing and the fan points like right"
"it's at the bottom so it points right at"
"your wrist while you're drawing on there"
"so if you don't like hot air blowing on"
"you while you're drawing"
"it does that on to the drawing"
"experience"
"so this is the pen that comes with the"
"hp envy x360 and the main thing to know"
"about this pen"
"is in the back of it there is a battery"
"and what you find in many battery"
"powered pens"
"is that you get some wave and jitter to"
"your lines and this pen"
"is no different so i'm starting this"
"process this little demo here that i'm"
"about to do"
"in autodesk sketchbook and and the"
"reason why"
"is because sketchbook sentence to have"
"wigglier"
"lines wigglier i'm trying having a hard"
"time getting that word out"
"than many other applications and that's"
"totally what i'm seeing here let me zoom"
"in here so you can see"
"these aren't like super slow like"
"sometimes i'll go really slow"
"to get the wobble in there these are"
"just kind of normal speed lines"
"and and they look nasty they look"
"absolutely"
"horrible the other thing that was"
"happening in sketchbook"
"is i was getting these palm recognition"
"dots"
"i should point out i'm wearing a drawing"
"glove people ask that in every video"
"and the main reason i wear that is is"
"not so much to reduce these"
"uh palm rejection dots the main reason"
"is because it's august"
"and it's hot and my hand sweats and"
"sticks to this smooth glass screen"
"there is a way to turn on streamlining"
"with these lines which is how i drew"
"most of this character"
"so your wine will start really jittery"
"but when you let go"
"it'll come in there and it'll smooth it"
"out for you"
"so there are some ways around that if"
"you choose to go this route"
"let's jump over to photoshop here and"
"i'm going to go ahead and create a new"
"document really quick"
"because in photoshop i feel like i'm"
"getting better performance than"
"i do in an app like sketchbook now you"
"do see"
"some wiggle to the lines but it's"
"you know it's not as bad as what we were"
"seeing before let me undo that brush"
"stroke"
"and let me get some lines in here just"
"some normal speeded lines"
"i'm making up words here as i go and you"
"can see there's some jitter to these"
"i can turn on smoothing in photoshop and"
"once i get it up to about 20 percent you"
"see these lines get"
"pretty nice actually those look pretty"
"good so there are ways to turn on"
"smoothing"
"and to get this pen looking better than"
"it was before"
"this also has smoothing on but i'm going"
"to just kind of go through the pressure"
"and the pressure curve is okay it it"
"seems to at times take a little while to"
"turn"
"on it has i would call it a strong"
"initial"
"activation which means you have to apply"
"more force"
"before it starts happening so if i just"
"drag it across the screen nothing"
"i start applying force and then i get a"
"line so if you're really light drawer"
"this probably isn't going to be a good"
"fit for you"
"so overall i would rate this pen a c"
"minus"
"if you use smoothing and if you don't"
"have to worry too much"
"about the the initial activation force"
"it's okay it works you can create good"
"artwork with this"
"if your software is helping you out a"
"little bit if you need that perfect pen"
"feel if you're looking for something"
"really smooth and really nice"
"out of the box without having to worry"
"about doing all these edits and"
"customizations"
"this is probably one to pass on"
"let's talk about those pros and those"
"cons the pro"
"is definitely the price here getting"
"this form factor at this price"
"can be a little bit hard to come by it"
"seems like as soon as you get into the"
"convertibles or the tablet e space"
"the price starts getting really really"
"high i saw some configurations on amazon"
"of the same exact laptop except it had"
"better specs"
"but it was only a little bit more and"
"overall generally i thought that the"
"price"
"versus value that you're getting for"
"this and the way you can customize those"
"specs on hp's website"
"was was a very good value if you're an"
"artist what it comes down to is you have"
"to ask yourself is do you need a great"
"pen"
"and if you need a great pen like the"
"perfect pen this probably isn't the"
"laptop for you"
"if you are looking to take notes or just"
"want a pen to use on the side or want to"
"do some light sketching from time to"
"time or take up a new hobby i think this"
"is a fantastic laptop"
"in fact in general i thought it was a"
"very good value obviously it's not a"
"super powerful laptop so if you're doing"
"drawing and illustration you're going to"
"be just fine if you're going to go into"
"3d work or you want to use it for gaming"
"i'm not so sure so that was the nvx 360."
"what do you think is this something that"
"you're interested in do you want to see"
"more reviews of windows all-in-ones let"
"me know down below in the comment"
"section"
"thank you guys for watching and i'll"
"talk to you in a couple of days"
"now last year I reviewed one of the more"
"popular convertible laptops on the"
"channel it was the HP Envy x360. what it"
"brought to the table was a good price to"
"Performance ratio good display good"
"battery life good performance and an all"
"metal design and best of all it doesn't"
"break the bank it came in at a very good"
"price well I couldn't wait to see what"
"HP had in store for its refresh here for"
"2022. I took delivery of it I did a live"
"unboxing of it and I'm really impressed"
"with it now one of the key differences"
"this time around is you can now get this"
"with an OLED option a full HD OLED"
"display still 15.6 inches but having an"
"OLED on this at this price point is a"
"Big Boon for a lot of people now I have"
"the full HD IPS model we'll see how that"
"does it has excellent battery life and"
"once again it doesn't disappoint in that"
"category improved performance with an"
"all new processor we'll talk about that"
"and it has an all metal design we'll see"
"if this all once again makes this one of"
"the best mid-tier valuable in terms of"
"price to Performance ratio convertibles"
"here for 2022. stay tuned we're going to"
"find out now hey everybody it's Andrew"
"and this is my review of the HP Envy"
"X360 all new for 2022. coming up"
"[Music]"
"now before we get to the unboxing I want"
"to let everyone know in the interest of"
"transparency in full disclosure are not"
"being paid by HP I'm not being sponsored"
"by HP all the opinions you're about to"
"hear are my own HP is not getting copy"
"approval that means they're seeing this"
"video for the first time just like you"
"though this unit is on loan from HP and"
"once this review is done I'll be sending"
"it back pricing for the X360 two-in-one"
"starts at"
"639.99 over at hp's website that to me"
"is a steal considering the upgrade"
"you're getting this year over last"
"year's model fully loaded with the new"
"OLED option you're looking at"
"1049.99 and price here as configured"
"with my review unit"
"899 dollars over at Best Buy I will"
"leave a link in the description below"
"for more information and where you can"
"buy it and I think when you look at the"
"price to Performance ratio here this to"
"me is a steal I would not hesitate on"
"this I would jump on it this is an"
"excellent two-in-one convertible"
"especially for the price and with the"
"specs in pricing out of the way let's"
"find out what you get inside the Box"
"let's open it up"
"it's the Nightfall black think you could"
"also get this in silver but I don't know"
"if that's only for the Intel version I'm"
"not sure and it feels a little bit of"
"heft on this again 15.6 inch display all"
"right let's see what some warranty"
"information some product information"
"that's pretty typical so we've got our"
"power charger it's USBC 65 Watts from HP"
"of course and I don't see the pen so"
"we'll have to bring our own pen I guess"
"and of course we get the unit here"
"get it out of the plastic"
"and there she is and that's of course"
"the Nightfall black and she is pretty so"
"you can see there's a vent on the bottom"
"there"
"sort of yeah you can see the fans there"
"actually coming through a little bit of"
"a fingerprint magnet because seal ready"
"Let's uh let's take a look at the"
"back of it first and then we'll get to"
"the ports there's some Envy branding"
"here you can see the color here it's"
"beautiful again you're gonna have to"
"keep it clean boxy look I guess you know"
"the linear edges and so forth now when"
"it comes to the fit and finish of it I"
"would say it's pretty good although I"
"noticed a little Flex in the chassis and"
"on the keyboard deck but not much but"
"again at this price point I'm not"
"surprised but for the most part this old"
"metal design really holds up and one of"
"the things I'm seeing a big Improvement"
"is less green wobble than you got last"
"year so when you're typing you don't"
"have a lot of movement on the screen and"
"that was a big complaint last year and"
"I'm glad they remedied that in this"
"version"
"okay let's check out the port selection"
"on the left side is a USB a port next to"
"that is a 3.5 millimeter microphone"
"headphone combo Jack and I love to see"
"this a full-size SD card reader and the"
"card sit flush with the unit they click"
"right in there and I love that now on"
"the right side are two USBC ports that"
"are full functions supporting data"
"charge and display out now no longer do"
"you need a barrel pin connection to"
"charge this laptop as this does support"
"USBC charging hence they give you a USBC"
"adapter this time around now"
"unfortunately these are not USB C4 ports"
"which would give you a lot of the"
"functionality you'd get from a"
"thunderbolt port and it was not able to"
"get it to work with my Thunderbolt drive"
"that I use for SSD storage that didn't"
"work on this so it's not usbc4"
"you can put it into the tent mode"
"and then of course presentation mode and"
"then of course tablet mode and again"
"it's a little heavy for a tablet but you"
"can do all the things you need to do now"
"there are four total options when it"
"comes to the display and it'll depend on"
"whether or not you got the Intel version"
"of this laptop or the AMD if you go with"
"the AMD there are two options I have the"
"IPS version with the 250-nit display and"
"there's also a new OLED option that's"
"also full HD 1920x1080 that's the first"
"time they're offering an OLED version on"
"this panel in terms of an AMD laptop now"
"if you go with the Intel version of this"
"laptop then you can go with the IPS that"
"can get as bright as 400 nits and then"
"there's a brand new Quad HD version"
"that's 2560 by 1440 that also has a high"
"refresh rate 120 hertz and that can get"
"as bright as 300 nits again intel only"
"now HP sends over the IPS version that"
"can get as bright as 215 nits now that's"
"not what I I was really hoping for here"
"I was hoping to go above 400 nits even"
"but of course if you go with the OLED"
"option which I highly encourage you to"
"do so that will get as bright as 400"
"nits but this one is rated at 250 nits"
"in terms of the brightness I actually"
"measured 260 again below my 300 nit"
"threshold"
"now one thing you need to be aware of"
"this is a very glossy display you will"
"notice that glare and Reflections"
"depending on your lighting conditions"
"but I think the OLED version is going to"
"have less of an issue because that will"
"get as bright as 400 nits as opposed to"
"the 216 nits I measured in this IPS"
"model having that higher brightness will"
"reduce the amount of glare Reflections"
"they have to contend with but it won't"
"totally eliminate it so just keep that"
"in mind and in everyday use for the past"
"week or so that I've had this has been"
"actually pretty good now this retains a"
"16 to 9 aspect ratio so what does that"
"mean you won't get the black bars on the"
"top and the bottom as you would with a"
"three to two aspect ratio or even a 16"
"to 10. so retaining that 16 to 9 on a"
"15.6 inch device I don't mind that and"
"you also get 88 screen to body ratio"
"that means you're going to get those"
"really small bezels so you don't have to"
"contend with the black bars and you get"
"the small bezels I'll take it now as far"
"as watching Netflix Amazon YouTube it's"
"been great on this again that is a"
"glossy display you'll have to keep that"
"in mind and but for the most part it's"
"worked out pretty well and of course the"
"OLED will be even more enhanced in terms"
"of the really deep blacks the vibrant"
"colors the really high contrast that you"
"get with an OLED display so for those"
"spend the extra money I think it's a 90"
"premium and that to me is well worth it"
"although it won't do quite as well in"
"terms of the battery life we'll get into"
"that in a little bit now if you're a"
"content creator I would stay away from"
"this IPS panel judging by these numbers"
"that I was able to measure on here"
"especially the color gamut not being"
"very good in terms of coverage that's 61"
"percent srgb 46 Adobe RGB 45 percent of"
"the DCI P3 wide color gamut and 44 ntsc"
"I would go with the OLED model you'll do"
"much better in terms of that coverage"
"you'll do better in the color accuracy"
"I'm pretty sure that this has a pretty"
"high Delta e score 3.03 meaning it's not"
"the most color accurate out there we'd"
"like to see it below too so if you do"
"any type of content creation go with the"
"OLED it'll do better better in terms of"
"that coverage of the color gamut it'll"
"be more color accurate and it'll be"
"better for Photoshop Lightroom video"
"editing and of course color grading and"
"as I mentioned earlier this is a"
"multi-touch display not only can use"
"your fingers but it also can use the pen"
"now HP didn't send over the pen with"
"this review unit but I was able to use"
"the HP pen sent over with the Specter"
"X360 13.5 inch and it worked perfectly"
"for taking notes sketching out diagrams"
"or artwork it'll be great for the note"
"taker or the digital artist and the pen"
"sticks magnetically to the side so you"
"won't lose it now to charge it it does"
"use USBC for those wondering and this"
"being a two-in-one convertible means you"
"could put it into the different modes"
"you've got the tent mode which is great"
"for recipes in the kitchen watching"
"movies Netflix Amazon YouTube has been"
"great in that mode the same could be"
"said for the stand or what I like to"
"call the presentation mode and of course"
"you could put it into the tablet mode"
"great for use with the pen"
"so big improvements when it comes to the"
"camera over last year's version of"
"course they now have gone to their five"
"megapixel camera and I think HP has done"
"an outstanding job in 2022 with their"
"cameras this is no exception they've"
"gone with this five megapixel as I"
"mentioned capable and what you're seeing"
"here is 1440p video what do you think"
"about the video quality what do you"
"think about the audio another big"
"Improvement is the fact that this is now"
"an IR camera allowing you to log in with"
"face recognition with Windows hello the"
"setup was easy and it's worked well so"
"that's been pretty good but one thing to"
"note they took away the fingerprint"
"scanner that we found in last year's"
"model no longer on the keyboard you now"
"can only log in with face recognition in"
"terms of that Windows hello or use your"
"passcode or password now as far as their"
"shutter switch it's still here it's the"
"key actually on the keyboard that allows"
"you to turn off the webcam for more"
"security and privacy we like to see that"
"it's got all the presence detection"
"features it has the auto frame being the"
"backlighting all the auto backlight so"
"make sure you're always not only in"
"frame but it also has the best lighting"
"condition to be presented to the viewer"
"so I think this is a really big"
"Improvement here in 2022 over last"
"year's model and I'm glad to see it here"
"on this Envy line especially for this"
"price what you get for the price here is"
"pretty amazing but I'm curious to know"
"what you think let me know in the"
"comment section below now good news when"
"it comes to getting inside this laptop"
"no longer are there any screws"
"underneath the rubber strips you don't"
"have to remove them all you need to do"
"is just remove the screws that are"
"visible outside of the unit of course"
"and pop off the bottom plate with either"
"guitar pick or a pry tool and you're in"
"and the better news is exactly what's"
"upgradable on this not only is the SSD"
"upgradeable the Wi-Fi card is upgradable"
"but the RAM is upgradable so the"
"trifectas here as far as upgradability"
"we like to see that now this review unit"
"sent over by HP has 12 gigabytes of RAM"
"and it's the ddr4 3200 Ram we saw last"
"year so we're not getting a bump up in"
"terms of the ddr5 we've been seeing here"
"in 2022 a little bit of a negative but"
"the fact of the matter is you could put"
"it in yourself and you can go beyond the"
"16 gigabytes which you can configure at"
"hp's website you can actually put it I"
"would say two 16 gigabyte sticks in here"
"for 32 gigabytes of RAM and it'll be"
"running of course in dual Channel mode"
"and this review unit has 512 gigabytes"
"of SSD storage the good news is it's"
"slotted in now judging by these reads"
"and writes these are gen 3 equivalent"
"speeds not the faster Gen 4 we'd like to"
"see here in 2022. the good news is you"
"could change it out yourself and put in"
"a faster drive now when it comes to the"
"Wi-Fi this has the mediatek Wi-Fi 6E"
"along with Bluetooth 5.2 it's a combo"
"card and as I mentioned it's slotted in"
"upgradable by the user so if you want to"
"change it out you have that option"
"that's always good and as far as the"
"Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth working on this"
"unit so far no issues on either front"
"both working as expected"
"okay let's talk about the keyboard and"
"I'm a big fan of the keyboard when it"
"comes to the tactility the key travel"
"very comfortable your fingers never feel"
"like you're going to bottom out"
"comfortable for typing long emails"
"comfortable for typing long documents so"
"it's been really good in that regard now"
"they did away with the numpads so those"
"number crunchers who do Excel"
"spreadsheets are going to be a little"
"bit disappointed but they did away with"
"that last year so that's a carryover to"
"this year so for those that want it you"
"don't get it now as far as the"
"multi-stage backlight that this has the"
"keys light up white and it's easy to"
"differentiate to see the contrast"
"between the keys and the white backlight"
"so that worked out well allowing you to"
"get work done in a dark room or a dimly"
"lit environment that's good and it has a"
"nice persistent touchpad it has a mylar"
"finish it's a smooth finish and it"
"allows for smooth scrolling it's pretty"
"responsive and when it comes to the"
"gestures everything works as you'd"
"expect good job on the touchpad and it's"
"a nicely sized touchpad at that okay"
"let's get into the performance and we're"
"seeing a nice year-over-year performance"
"increase here not a huge increase but a"
"nice increase nonetheless this is"
"running the brand new ryzen 7 5825u"
"that's an 8 core 16 thread processor of"
"course from AMD in their ryzen series"
"and as you can see a higher PC Mark 10"
"score higher single core multi-core"
"score across the board in both the"
"geekbench 5 and the cinebench R23 test"
"showing that this is a very good"
"performer for everyday tasks such as"
"Microsoft Office email web browsing you"
"could do 1080p video editing it's got"
"the integrated Radeon graphics it's not"
"going to blow you away in terms of the"
"graphics performance but you can do some"
"video editing and some 3D rendering I"
"wouldn't do 4K video editing on this"
"you'd want to look for something with a"
"discrete GPU and when it comes to gaming"
"I think it goes without saying this is"
"not a dedicated gaming laptop there are"
"better options out there with discrete"
"gpus this has the integrated Radeon"
"graphics but if you lower some of the"
"settings you can get somewhat play label"
"formates on some of the more popular"
"titles again this is good for the"
"occasional game here and there but as"
"your main gaming laptop I would look at"
"other options"
"and one of the reasons we're seeing"
"pretty good performance on this is"
"because I'm seeing little thermal"
"throttling when I ran the prime 95"
"stress test to see if this will power"
"throttle under heavy load I noticed that"
"it would get a little bit high in terms"
"of the temperatures but never getting"
"overly hot and never reducing the clock"
"speeds to the point where performance is"
"compromised it's actually had pretty"
"good clock speeds throughout now when it"
"comes to the fan noise the fans will"
"kick in on their heavy load getting"
"about 45 or 46 decibels at the loudest"
"when you're under that performance mode"
"but under the regular mode you're pretty"
"much quiet all the all around that's"
"pretty good now when it comes to the"
"surface temperatures relatively cool"
"throughout in terms of the surface"
"temperatures there is a few hot spots"
"the one above the keyboard below the"
"display and then there's one on the"
"underside as you see here but for the"
"most part remained relatively cool"
"okay let's talk about the battery life"
"and as I mentioned earlier this is a 51"
"watt hour battery and before you jump to"
"conclusion saying that's too small the"
"battery life on this has been excellent"
"scoring over 14 hours on my continuous"
"web serving test over wi-fi at 115 nits"
"you're looking at anywhere between 11 to"
"12 hours in real world mix usage and"
"that is excellent here for 2022 very"
"efficient chipset excellent battery life"
"so for those Road Warriors that need a"
"longevity in terms of that battery life"
"this will not disappoint you now the"
"included 65 watt USBC power adapter"
"takes about an hour and 40 minutes to"
"charge this laptop to full not too bad"
"in terms of charging"
"all right let's talk about the audio and"
"when it comes to the audio there are two"
"bottom facing speakers as you can see"
"here and I thought the vibe could be a"
"little bit louder but I thought it was"
"decent and the mids were decent and"
"there was a hint of bass not the best"
"audio I've heard but again at this price"
"point I'm not expecting outstanding"
"MacBook Pro quality audio but for the"
"most part for a convertible it's okay"
"let's give it a listen with epidemic"
"sound if you want to save 10 off"
"epidemic sound see the link in the"
"description below now let's give this a"
"listen"

"all right folks let's bring it all home"
"what do I think about the HP Envy X360"
"here for 2022 and I gotta say on some"
"levels a lot of big improvements"
"especially the CPU performance year over"
"year nice increase there I like the fact"
"that they're now offering this with a"
"OLED display that's something we didn't"
"get last year especially with this AMD"
"ryzen model that is going to be a"
"welcome addition because I think you"
"need to stay away from this full HD IPS"
"display which barely hit 260 nits on my"
"measurements definitely not bright"
"enough and it's a highly glossy display"
"which compounds the issue so if you're"
"gonna get this I would go with the OLED"
"but there is a silver lining to this"
"full HD IPS display and that would be"
"that amazing battery life getting over"
"14 hours on my continuous web surfing"
"test over wi-fi at 115 nits and real"
"world mixed usage you're looking at 11"
"to 12 hours at a minimum on this device"
"which is excellent here for 2022. The"
"Thermals are excellent on this as well"
"the port selection is excellent although"
"I I would have liked to have seen usb4"
"on this instead you get USB 3.2 but for"
"the most part I like the fact that"
"you're getting that full-size SD card"
"reader and the card sit flush with the"
"unit so good job on the ports and we're"
"getting a much improved webcam this time"
"around going with that 5 megapixel"
"camera capable of 1440p video and that's"
"going to be great for your video"
"conferencing a big improvement over last"
"year"
"now if you're going to buy this get the"
"OLED option it's only ninety dollars"
"more and I think for that price you're"
"getting a lot for the money I'm going to"
"give this a score of 87 making the HP"
"Envy X 360 here for 2022 definitely"
"worth your money so please hit the like"
"button please subscribe please share"
"this video don't forget to leave a"
"comment in that comment section below"
"let me know how I'm doing let me know if"
"there's a device or something out there"
"you think I should review I'll do my"
"best to try to make that happen don't"
"forget to check me out on Facebook"
"Twitter Instagram and of course my"
"website"
"amdtechreviews.com so until next time"
"this is Andrew from AMD Tech"
"see ya"
"this is lisa from mobile tech review and"
"this is the"
"hp envy x360 15"
"or 15z specifically which means the amd"
"ryzen inside yay that"
"so i always like the envy line because"
"well they sit between the pavilion which"
"is a pretty low end line from hp"
"and the very pricey spectre line and"
"you've got things like an aluminum clad"
"chassis here the usual 360 degree hinges"
"pen support on board and more we're"
"going to look at it now"
"so the this model starts around 699 list"
"price currently actually 659 on hp's"
"website"
"and that gets you a rise in five eight"
"gigs of ram a 256 gig ssd and a full hd"
"touch and pen compatible display not too"
"bad"
"really considering this is a pretty"
"classy chassis a nice design all that"
"sort of thing"
"and the mod that we have is a little"
"higher in configuration and list price"
"is about 9.99 you'll probably find it"
"for less again"
"and now it has 16 gigs of ram 512 gig"
"ssd horizon 7 and a full hd"
"brighter version of the display there's"
"two versions of the display with the amd"
"models one's 250 nits ooh"
"that and the 400 nit display we have"
"which is like 80"
"more totally worth the spend i would say"
"unless you work in really dark places"
"all the time especially because hp"
"displays are very reflective"
"so inside we have amd ryzen like i said"
"so this is a 5000 series set of cpus"
"we have the ryzen 7 5700u"
"it gets a little confusing what ryzen's"
"doing with the u-series cpus this year"
"so"
"it's a 5000 series which is normally the"
"latest but"
"some of them like the 5700 and the 5500"
"this is also available with"
"are based on a modified zen 2"
"architecture not the latest"
"zen 3 architecture that said it's still"
"a good enough cpu"
"and in terms of thermals and battery"
"life it's still"
"doing better than intel and so it's"
"desirable nonetheless even it's not the"
"ultimate fastest and it allows them to"
"sell it to you for this great price so"
"yeah i mean we're talking about eight"
"percent difference in performance"
"between this and a zen 3 architecture"
"not something you want to kill yourself"
"over if you need to save some money"
"speaking of intel there is an intel"
"model which"
"is the 15 t which is typical for hp"
"lingo with their z's for amd and ts for"
"intel that one is also available with"
"the 4k"
"400 nit ips display all the displays are"
"ips on this model so if you really have"
"to have a 4k display you're going to"
"have to go to intel and spend some more"
"money too where it's available with core"
"i5 and core i7"
"intel 11th gen tiger lake u-series cpus"
"since this is basically a big ultrabook"
"a 15-inch convertible which is pretty"
"typical for convertibles"
"you're looking at amd radeon graphics or"
"if you got the intel version you'd have"
"iris xe graphics there's"
"really not room for a d gpu in here and"
"again for this one they're keeping"
"the price down that said it's perfectly"
"fine for things like"
"well content consumption anything can"
"handle that these days"
"and even for things like doing some"
"photoshop it's actually"
"perfectly fine for casual everyday sort"
"of use then"
"a little bit of video editing i"
"personally prefer h series more powerful"
"cpus that use 45 watts of power if"
"you're gonna be"
"serious about doing 4k video editing or"
"something like that"
"build quality on this is pretty good"
"it's stamped aluminum chassis again it's"
"nice enough looking in that minimalist"
"way that i think ages well and"
"offends no one shows some fingerprints"
"but not a lot it's got"
"pretty good structural rigidity on board"
"the weight is pretty reasonable"
"for a convertible of this size ports are"
"pretty good on this in terms of the"
"number and selection you've got"
"two usb a ports and those are 10 gigabit"
"per second we have one usbc"
"10 gigabit per second and no thunderbolt"
"because not"
"intel there's that hdmi 2.0 a"
"headphone jack of course and a full-size"
"sd card slot yay that so"
"this is aimed toward consumer content"
"creator type so that's nice to have the"
"sd card slot on board"
"display on this again we have the full"
"hd 400 nit display"
"i on hp's website it says it comes with"
"their magnetically attached active pen"
"which is n trig now called microsoft pen"
"protocol 2.0"
"with tilt support but we didn't get the"
"pen in the box but we'll show you the"
"one that comes with the spectre"
"anyway hopefully you'll get a pen in the"
"box if you want one"
"the display on this subjectively is nice"
"looking and hp says that they calibrated"
"for"
"under delta e of 2.0 which is pretty"
"good and in fact it's true"
"you look at it and you say that's a nice"
"pleasant display most people enjoy"
"watching content on it it's obviously"
"not a super wide gamut and again"
"reflections it's an annoying thing with"
"hp's consumer laptops they"
"have plenty of reflections the pen works"
"decently on this"
"entry is not my favorite but"
"it is catching up with wacom aes and"
"still not as good as wacom emr or an"
"apple pencil but"
"certainly is good for note-taking if"
"you're editing photos which is the idea"
"with this if you're doing creative kind"
"of stuff and if you want to do some"
"drawing"
"it'll do the job for you in terms of"
"performance it is where we expect it to"
"be which is pretty darn good even if"
"it's not the apex of what ryzen can do"
"right now and it holds its own certainly"
"versus intel"
"11th gen if not outperforming it have"
"been a multi-core test not on single"
"core so much"
"anyway it's a good performer and the"
"selling point with ryzen is the fact"
"that it runs cooler and uses less power"
"than"
"seven nanometer process it does we'll"
"show you the internals it does even have"
"two fans that's a lot of cooling"
"actually for this and"
"uh you've got a bunch of powerful"
"profiles to choose from for actually"
"anything from what's called quiet so you"
"must never hear the fans all the way to"
"full performance and it's not typically"
"a noisy laptop nor does it get burning"
"hot to the touch it's cooler than most"
"spectres for example which tend to be"
"hot customers because they're pushing"
"the performance and the size and the"
"thinness there"
"more than they do with the envy line"
"speaking of battery life it's a 51 watt"
"hour battery which is okay it's kind of"
"more standard for a 13-inch ultrabook"
"but hey"
"it's not bad and given the fact that we"
"have a fairly powerful platform going on"
"hp claims up to 13 hours of battery life"
"and manufacturers claims are optimistic"
"but we were doing about"
"nine on this with brightness set to 150"
"hits"
"mix of productivity streaming video a"
"little bit of creative work in photoshop"
"doing that for about half an hour of the"
"time it comes with a 65 watt fast"

"50 to 100 is always slower on"
"laptop charging and phone charging as a"
"matter of fact too to increase"
"battery health there is a fingerprint"
"scanner embedded in the keyboard deck"
"there is no windows hello ir camera for"
"facial recognition login"
"but for the price that's totally fair"
"the webcam is your usual"
"okay webcam and there is a privacy"

"in white and i like the tactile feel of"
"this nice and crispy"
"key spring back all that sort of thing"
"not mushy at all not in deep travel by"
"any means but"
"nonetheless i found it pleasant to type"
"on and the track pad is"
"spacious certainly and works just fine"
"to take off the aluminum bottom cover"
"there are two"
"visible torx t5 screws and four two here"
"and two here"
"phillips head screws that are not"
"visible you have to pull off the rubber"
"strips here"
"now if you do it carefully you can leave"
"the adhesive intact other than the"
"occasional"
"cat hair that sticks to it so you can"
"put them back on again"
"that's pretty annoying but it gets worse"
"because there are some very tenacious"
"clips here"
"work around the hinge area first lift it"
"up and then"
"work your way around to get this"
"aluminum cover off"
"they make you work for it folks which is"
"kind of a shame because"
"this is more upgradable than usual for a"
"15-inch convertible basically ultrabook"
"so here yeah i know it looks like a war"
"zone right because i've had to pull up"
"some of the thermal tape"
"but here are the two fans here which is"
"quite a lot of cooling for something"
"with well"
"basically ultrabook cpu and integrated"
"radeon graphics this is the m.2 ssd slot"
"here so you could upgrade that yourself"
"and that's"
"not too hard to get to obviously pretty"

"hour battery and we have the socketed"
"wi-fi six card with bluetooth five which"
"is an intel ax"
"200 card so you want to know about this"
"cover right so this is the special treat"
"you don't usually see"
"and that is and believe me this has a"
"lot of clips too this heat shield here"
"two ram slots so uh-huh you could"
"upgrade this after the fact if you have"
"the patience and care of a saint to take"
"off this bottom cover"
"so that's the hp ndx 360 15-inch for"
"2021 with ryzen inside"
"i applaud what you get for the price"
"honestly and envies usually are a good"
"deal"
"it's a nice looking aluminum clad"
"machine 360 degree hinges pen support"
"touch screen"
"and pretty good keyboard on this and the"
"upgradability if you can tolerate trying"
"to get inside this"
"is really unusually good for a 15-inch"
"convertible ultrabook i mean you got two"

"of course your m.2 is socketed and your"

"Hi everyone. Today, we have the HP Envy X360 Convertible laptop."
"This 2021-edition premium laptop is brand new to the market. So thanks to HP for sending me this review unit."
"This is not a sponsored video. The box has a minimal design and shows the laptop and HP branding."
"Inside the box, you have the laptop, some manuals, and an AC power adapter. However, you're still able to use your USB-C charger."
"The HP Envy 15 focuses on laptops and products, specifically for creators. The model # for this laptop is 15-eu0097nr."
"Although this color is shown to be black on the website, it's not really black. More like a grey. The logo is creatively shown in the middle."
"It has an aluminum body made from recycled materials. Even the packaging is recycled. A very environmental-friendly initiative by HP."
"There are 2 hinges, 1 of them with the 'ENVY' display and a heat sink in the bottom."
"This is a 2-in-1 laptop so it can be easily used as a tablet or a laptop."
"On the left side, you have USB-A, HDMI, and USB- C ports, and an audio jack. The USB-C port is not a thunderbolt port."
"On the right side, you have an SD card reader, USB-A port, and an ac adapter port."
"You get a 15.6"" screen with a screen-to-body ratio of 89% and ultra-slim bezels."
"The touchpad is 19% bigger and placed in the center compared to other laptop brands. It has a slippery and sleek feel to it."
"The power button is made a bit harder to press. This is to avoid accidental shutoff."
"For extra privacy, you get camera shutter and mute mic buttons. These options secure your privacy and safety."
"Overall, I like the organized keyboard layout. One annoyance was that the location of the fingerprint reader is down with the arrows. I'm used to it being on the top."
"This laptop weighs 4.11 lbs (1.8 Kg). I really like these 2-in-1 designs."
"Display features: 15.6"" IPS FHD display and 400 nits. For a base model, you'll get 250 nits."
"This touchscreen laptop is equipped with Bang&Olufsen speakers for the best audio (which is what I have in my Audi)."
"This video footage is on the HP webcam. Judge the video and audio for yourself."
"This laptop has an AMD Ryzen 7 5700U processor and 16GB RAM. This specific model (15-eu0097nr) costs $999 plus tax, for a total of $1093."
"The base model has an AMD Ryzen 5 5500U processor and 8GB RAM."
"I ran a Geekbench 5 test. Cpu scores are 969 (single-core score) and 5990 (multi-core score). The GPU score is 8085."
"I recommend this laptop for creators and editors, but not if you work with large files because you don't get a graphics card. Same thing for gamers. Recommended for casual gamers, not for professionals."
"This laptop will be available in India in 3-4 months for approx. 100,000 Rs."
"Wireless technology specs: Wi-Fi 6 and BlueTooth 5.0 combo. Battery life: fast charge and 50% in 30 min."
"Battery life: 12 hrs for video playback, 11 hrs web browsing, and 5-6 hrs for editing in 4K."
"Again, this is not a sponsored video. This laptop is a loaner unit for 14 days. Overall, I'm impressed with this laptop."
"Shoutout to Anurag_singh0017 for following me on Instagram and subscribing to my channel. Make sure you follow and subscribe also to hear your name on this channel."
"And this completes today's video. I'll see you in the next one."
"now HP just sent over what I think might"
"be the best convertible 13-inch laptop"
"here for 2022. it not only brings a 16"
"to 10 aspect ratio 12th gen Intel"
"processor of course it's a u-series"

"being paid by HP I'm not being sponsored"
"by HP all the opinions you're about to"
"hear are my own HP is not getting copy"
"approval they're seeing this video for"
"the first time just like you now this"
"review unit is on loan from HP and once"
"this review is done I'll be sending it"
"back the nvx360 13-inch starts at 8.99"
"it is customizable over at hp's website"
"Best Buy offers a really good SKU that"
"gives you excellent battery life that's"
"10 49.99 and my review unit which is"
"fully maxed out comes in at 1299.99 over"
"at hp's website for those interested"
"I'll leave links in the description"
"below for more information and we can"
"buy one now the only available color"
"right now is the natural silver we've"
"seen that before but HP sent over this"
"one this is space blue and it's a really"
"nice color and it will be a custom"
"advisable color for you to choose later"
"on it's just not available yet and for"
"those wondering what's the difference"
"between the 2021 model and this year's"
"model well this chart will show you some"
"of those differences"
"and with the specs and pricing out of"
"the way let's find out what you get"
"inside the Box let's open it up"
"lifting the lid you greeted by the unit"
"itself we're going to get to that in"
"just a moment but let's find out what"
"else you get you get some product"
"information along with some warranty"
"information as well now you get a 65"
"watt USBC power adapter it's a braided"
"cable and you get the power cord they"
"also sent over the HP tilt pen that"
"gives you extra pen tips and it charges"
"via USBC we're going to test that out"
"later on as well now handling this unit"
"for the first time I love the blue color"
"on this this is thin light and it's all"
"metal design is Rock Solid nice job in"
"terms of the looks and the build okay"
"folks let's check out the port selection"
"on the left side is a 3.5 millimeter"
"microphone headphone combo Jack a Micro"
"SD card reader next to that is a drop"
"jaw usba Port moving over to the right"
"side you get a second drop jaw usb-a"
"port and two USBC Thunderbolt 4 ports"
"that are full function supporting data"
"charge and display out now one little"
"nitpick is I'd like to have these two"
"USBC Thunderbolt 4 ports on opposite"
"sides of each other instead of being on"
"the same side of this convertible laptop"
"the other thing is I'd like to have HDMI"
"I understand this is a very thin and"
"light Ultra portable so space is at a"
"premium but it would have been nice to"
"have it nonetheless"
"now HP made it really easy to get inside"
"this laptop no longer do you have to"
"remove any rubber strips to get to any"
"hidden screws all you need to do is"
"remove the four T5 Torx screws and"
"that's it use a guitar pick or a pry"
"tool and pop off the bottom plate and"
"you're in I like how easy that is"
"and as far as user upgradability is"
"concerned it comes as no surprise that"
"the ram is soldered into the motherboard"
"my review unit has 16 gigabytes of RAM"
"and it is running in dual Channel mode"
"now it seems to me that 16 might be the"
"maximum you can go as I didn't see on"
"hp's website an option to go to 32 which"
"would be a little bit unfortunate but"
"again I'll look into that and report my"
"findings or whatever HP tells me but as"
"far as this unit again 16 gigabytes of"
"RAM now as far as the SSC is concerned"
"that is user upgradable my review unit"
"has one terabyte of SSD storage and as"
"you can see from these reads and writes"
"excellent speeds indicating that this is"
"a Gen 4 SSD something we like to see"
"here in 2022 good job on that front now"
"it comes to wireless this is running"
"Wi-Fi 6E along with Bluetooth 5.2 no"
"issues on either the Wi-Fi or the"
"Bluetooth and one thing to note that is"
"slotted in so you can upgrade it"
"yourself down the road that's always a"
"nice option to have it's not soldered"
"into the motherboard that's good to see"
"as well"
"now when it comes to the display there"
"are actually three options you can go"
"with a full HD Plus option that's IPS"
"1920x1200 multi-touch display that can"
"get as bright as 400 nits then the"
"mid-tier one would be the one with a"
"2560 by 1600 resolution that also can"
"get as bright as 400 nits and then"
"there's an OLED option that's the one I"
"have it's a 2.8k option 2880 by 1800 and"
"that is a low blue light filter it also"
"is at high dynamic range in terms of HDR"
"content that's going to be great and it"
"also has a brightness and standard"
"definition of 400 nits so that's the one"
"that HP sent over that's the top of the"
"line display"
"and I love the move to a 16 to 10 aspect"
"ratio you'll see a little bit more on"
"the display you'll do less scrolling"
"when it comes to web browsing that's a"
"big improvement over the 16 to 9 display"
"you got last year now something to keep"
"in mind with a 16 to 10 display you're"
"going to get slight bars on the top and"
"the bottom when you're consuming media"
"that was optimized for a 16 to 9 aspect"
"ratio so that's just something to be"
"aware of and as with any OLED display"
"you're going to get the really deep"
"blacks the super vibrant colors that"
"just pop off the display the really high"
"contrast it's all there that's why I"
"love an OLED display it just looks"
"fantastic and the fact that this is an"
"HDR display watching High dynamic range"
"content on this OLED display has it been"
"simply superb I'm absolutely loving this"
"for consuming media and it has excellent"
"coverage of the color gamut so this is"
"going to be great for the content"
"creator as well as having really good"
"color accuracy so if you're going to do"
"Lightroom Photoshop video editing in"
"color grading this panel will not"
"disappoint it is excellent for those"
"tasks now a couple of notes about the"
"display there's no 4K plus option this"
"is as high as it's going to go the 2880"
"by 1800 that's 2.8 K there's no high"
"refresh rate other than the 60 hertz you"
"don't get 120 you don't get 90 that's"
"something to be aware of that would have"
"been nice especially if you're doing"
"gaming or something like that but for"
"Content creation or you're doing things"
"like that 60 hertz will certainly"
"suffice and it'll give you better"
"battery life and it's also a glossy"
"display and you'll notice the glaring"
"Reflections it'll depend on your"
"lighting conditions something to be"
"aware of but my overall takeaway is this"
"2.8 KO LED display is simply superb and"
"if you have the money I would go with"
"this option but there is one caveat of"
"course and that means the OLED display"
"will use more power and take up more"
"battery life you'll do better on the IPS"
"versions if you're looking for more"
"longevity now this being a two-in-one"
"convertible means you can't quite open"
"it with one finger that has really tight"
"hinges by the way a big improvement over"
"the last generation you don't get a lot"
"of screen wobble either that's again a"
"big Improvement we'd like to see that"
"and of course this being a two-in-one"
"convertible means you could put this"
"into the different modes you get the"
"tent mode which is great for recipes in"
"the kitchen consuming media watching"
"Netflix Amazon and YouTube the same"
"could be said of the stand mode that's"
"be great for presentations and so forth"
"I actually really like that mode and"
"then of course you could always put it"
"into the tablet mode great for use with"
"the pen and speaking of the pen HP also"
"includes the HP tilt pen which charges"
"via USBC and stores magnetically to the"
"side as you see here and the pen is"
"great for taking notes sketching out"
"diagrams sketching out artwork it really"
"depends on what you want to do with it"
"again no takers digital artists will"
"gravitate towards the band I thought it"
"worked really well and I also love using"
"the pen in tablet mode great for"
"navigating through the OS with that pen"
"really worked well"
"this is a much improved camera over last"
"year's model this now is a five"
"megapixel camera it's got the Glam cam"
"features the auto framing the auto"
"correction the auto lighting it's got"
"all the bells and whistles that we've"
"been seeing here in 2022 HP has done a"
"great job in terms of these cameras it's"
"now an IR camera that allows you to log"
"in with face recognition with Windows"
"hello there is no longer a fingerprint"
"scanner located on the keyboard that's"
"gone so now you'll have to rely on the"
"IR camera and again it's working well"
"setup was easy now there's a dedicated"
"key on the keyboard that allows you to"
"turn off the webcam for more security"
"and privacy so that's always good I'm"
"curious to know what you think let me"
"know in the comment section below what"
"do you think about the video quality and"
"what do you think about the audio"
"quality of the array mics and for those"
"wondering this is the difference year"
"over year in terms of the webcam the one"
"on the left is a 720p webcam and it's"
"not IR the one on the right is the 2022"
"webcam 5 megapixels and it is IR so big"
"difference"
"now I'm a big fan of the NV keyboards I"
"liked it on the 15 inch version I love"
"it here on the 13 inch version I like"
"the tactility the key travels excellent"
"and I also love the fact that the keys"
"light up really nicely here easy to see"
"the differentiation and the contrast"
"between the backlight and the keys"
"especially with this blue model here I'm"
"not sure about the silver but with this"
"blue model you have no trouble"
"identifying the keys so the back lights"
"working well and it's great for typing"
"out long emails long documents very"
"comfortable your fingers never feel like"
"you're going to bottom out there so"
"that's been very good the touchpad is"
"also pretty spacious for a 13 inch"
"convertible two finger scrolling was"
"very responsive and all the gestures"
"work as you'd expect so good job on that"
"front as well all right let's talk"
"battery life and the HP Envy X360"
"13-inch Sports a 4 cell 66 watt hour"
"battery and considering this as a 2.8k"
"OLED display this did really well on the"
"battery test probably the best result"
"I've seen this year as far as an OLED"
"display is concerned and this did over"
"13 and a half hours on my continuous web"
"serving test over Wi-Fi in 150 nits what"
"does that mean in real world mixed usage"
"you're looking at anywhere between 9 to"
"10 hours depending on what you're doing"
"in terms of real world mixed usage so"
"remember everybody's use case is a"
"little bit different so your mileage may"
"vary but my overall takeaway is the"
"battery life is excellent considering"
"this as a 2.8k OLED display now if you"
"go with the IPS offerings in terms of"
"the display you'll do even better in"
"terms of battery life that's even better"
"and if you need to charge it takes a"
"little bit over an hour and a half to"
"give you a full charge with the supplied"
"65 watt USBC power adapter okay let's"
"talk performance and this Sports a"
"12-chan Intel processor it's the core i7"
"1250u a 10 core processor from Intel"
"that's eight efficiency cores into"
"performance cores and as you can see"
"from these numbers year over year and"
"nice increase over the 11th gen from"
"last year now this also Sports"
"integrated Iris XE graphics and I've"
"gone over this before I think they're"
"getting a little bit long in the tooth"
"and you could do some 1080p video"
"editing I wouldn't do 4K video editing"
"with integrated Iris XC graphics and you"
"can play some games if you lower the"
"settings I've shown it a number of times"
"here on the channel you'll get playable"
"frame rates but of course you could"
"always add an external GPU thanks to the"
"two Thunderbolt 4 ports that this has"
"and we're seeing the biggest Improvement"
"is in the multi-core performance over"
"last year's model and that's going to"
"give you the really good performance"
"here especially on the cinebench R23"
"which tests for any kind of thermal"
"throttling in a heavy sustained workload"
"it did well in that regard and for those"
"wondering what the difference is with"
"the 2021 model that's running the 11 Gen"
"processor well this is the difference"
"here and as you can see year over year a"
"big Improvement in both the single core"
"and multi-core performance when it comes"
"to the CPU and even an improvement when"
"it comes to these integrated Iris XE"
"Graphics definitely showing the"
"improvements in 2022 that's for sure and"
"when it comes to the audio this has"
"bottom firing speakers they're tuned by"
"bang Olufsen decent volume good mids"
"good bass I would say this is a pretty"
"good sound filling up a room rather"
"nicely for an ultra portable convertible"
"laptop we don't normally see that so"
"good job on that regard now to give an"
"example of the speakers let's listen to"
"epidemic sound and if you want to save"
"10 percent off epidemic sound see the"
"link in the description below"
"thank you"
"[Music]"
"okay people let's bring it on home what"
"do I think about the HP Envy X360"
"convertible 13-inch laptop here for 2022"
"big changes across the board I like the"
"move to a 16 to 10 aspect ratio and the"
"offering of a stunning 13.3 inch 2.8 K"
"OLED display you got a thin and Light"
"chassis a very Sleek design very"
"versatile design of course good Port"
"selection here excellent battery life"
"including this OLED option that I was a"
"little bit surprised with that how good"
"the battery was really good IPS expect"
"even more battery that's great durable"
"Rock Solid design as I mentioned pcie"
"Gen 4 SSD storage the speeds were very"
"good full HD webcam is a nice"
"improvement over last year 1080p video"
"that's been great the microphone sounds"
"great hp's done a really good job with"
"their microphones and and cameras here"
"in 2022 and I like the good audio coming"
"out of the speakers now the negatives of"
"course you get soldered RAM and the blue"
"color which I think is absolutely"
"gorgeous is also a major fingerprint"
"magnet you will be wiping it down quite"
"a bit but I think hp's hit a home run"
"here with big changes pretty much across"
"the board that's why I'm going to give"
"it my editor's choice for the 13-inch"
"convertible laptop category here for"
"2022 making it worth your money"
"so what do you think about this bad boy"
"the nvx360 this gorgeous blue by the way"
"I'm really liking it but one thing to be"
"aware of it is a major fingerprint"
"magnet you probably notice it here on"
"the video uh really thin and light nice"
"all metal design very premium very"
"high-end nice Port selection on this no"
"complaints on that front uh really great"
"display here 2.8 K OLED display 13.3"
"inches it's a 16 to 10 aspect ratio 2880"
"by 1800 all the Hallmarks of the OLED"
"display are here the Deep blacks the"
"vibrant colors the high contrast it's"
"all there nice that they include the pen"
"with this model it's the HP rechargeable"
"tilt pen the charges via USBC sticks"
"magnetically to the side and that's a"
"nice value add right there for those"
"that want to sketch out diagrams take"
"some notes artwork you know you get the"
"idea now as far as the battery life"
"something I wasn't expecting on this"
"with an OLED display over 13 and a half"
"hours on my continuous web serving test"
"that's about 9-10 hours maybe 11 hours"
"depending on what you're doing on real"
"world mixed usage so this is something"
"we haven't seen before good battery life"
"with an OLED display so this might hit"
"the perfect combination there now of"
"course you want even more battery life I"
"would imagine the IPS offerings the"
"other two uh would really come to play"
"there would really give you some good"
"results but very satisfied with this one"
"and for the price considering you're"
"getting an OLED display you're getting"
"the great battery life and the good"
"performance really double the"
"performance multi-core year over year"
"this is a great value again thirteen"
"hundred dollars all in and I think it's"
"a nice complete package but I'm curious"
"to know you think let me know in the"
"comments section below so please hit the"
"like button please subscribe please"
"share this video don't forget to leave a"
"comment in that comment section below"
"let me know how I'm doing let me know if"
"there's a device or something out there"
"you think I should review I'll do my"
"best to try to make that happen don't"
"forget to check me out on Facebook"
"Twitter Instagram and of course my my"
"website"
"amdtechreviews.com so until next time"
"this is Andrew from AMD Tech"
"see ya"
"they call it the hp envy x360 the"
"benchmarks are in"
"the thoughts have been noted on the"
"build quality and performance"
"let's get right into this review this is"
"the ryzen 7 5700u model with integrated"
"graphics"
"now because of that i was slightly"
"disappointed by some"
"of the performance specs be it anything"
"that requires heavy rendering so"
"right off the bat if you're looking for"
"this computer for 3d modeling i would"
"not go for it i would immediately push"
"you towards something like"
"the hp omen which has a good strong"
"powerful dedicated gpu and once that"
"review comes out you can check it out in"
"the youtube cards above but right off"
"the bat let's jump right into the build"
"quality"
"first and foremost i love the new softer"
"edges"
"they are so smooth and as you can see"
"from last year's model"
"the rounded edges don't catch your"
"fingers as much and just make for a more"
"comfortable laptop to handle"
"while we have this thing up on its side"
"let's take a look at the ports comes"
"with the usb"
"type a hdmi usb type-c which is not"
"thunderbolt 3 headphone jack and on the"
"other side we have"
"a sd card slot usb type a and the"
"ac power adapter now do note that you"
"can charge the laptop"
"using the usbc i do not have a usb"
"type-c"
"charger so unfortunately i did not test"
"that but it charges very quickly"
"with the ac power adapter and has a"
"fantastic battery life"
"while web browsing and doing"
"productivity tasks as well as good"
"battery life while streaming video"
"on youtube now for 4k video editing"
"and photoshop it doesn't have the most"
"amazing battery life"
"but better than most laptops i've"
"reviewed on my channel so for creative"
"tasks i recommend bringing that charger"
"along with you"
"as it will not last all day all aluminum"
"on the top cover"
"bottom cover side panels and keyboard"
"deck there's a little bit of give"
"on the top cover but not a lot now when"
"you open"
"the laptop you're going to have to use"
"two hands because if you don't"
"well that's going to happen so"
"definitely two hands is important now"
"one thing i want to point out though"
"you saw the screen flex but this is"
"pretty awesome this"
"laptop has the least amount of"
"screen flex as far as this motion that"
"i've ever seen it's such a firm and"
"solid screen"
"however it does bounce a little bit as"
"you can see there but it does not bounce"
"when you're typing so as i'm typing"
"the screen stays nice and still and of"
"course this is a convertible laptop"
"so you can do that and use it as a"
"little presentation thing or touch"
"screen whatever you might want to do"
"okay the next thing to consider is the"
"press along"
"the top here also good press in the"
"middle"
"not a big deal this laptop like i said"
"for the all-aluminum chassis"
"is fantastic firm strong a lot of times"
"you'll get a hold of a aluminum laptop"
"you're like man it just"
"it feels so cheap so thin and chintzy"
"this laptop does not feel thin and"
"chintzy"
"in my opinion so one thing i wanted to"
"correct about my unboxing is i said that"
"the top"
"vents were actually speakers and this is"
"incorrect the speakers are right here"
"on the bottom cover"
"[Music]"
"[Applause]"
"but they should be vents right but"
"unfortunately when you turn the computer"
"over and you take it apart"
"they're not really venting to anything"
"the fans are in the middle"
"which makes sense because the main vent"
"on the bottom cover is in the middle"
"but where are these top grilles venting"
"are they pulling air in are they"
"pushing air out it's it looks to me as"
"if they are"
"more for show than anything the other"
"available model of the hp envy x360 has"
"the vent"
"along the bottom of the screen so the"
"top of the keyboard deck which makes"
"sense"
"because this right here would be the top"
"of the keyboard deck"
"so that vent would actually be useful in"
"pulling air in or pushing"
"air out of the chassis the vents along"
"the side"
"don't really make sense so this model"
"runs substantially cooler"
"than this model and because of that your"
"only main vent is"
"actually right here along the back panel"
"of the chassis"
"which is why we're seeing quite poor"
"thermals"
"on this laptop this year i was very"
"disappointed by the thermals to be"
"totally honest it got"
"up to 95 degrees celsius during the 4k"
"export"
"during the photoshop benchmarks it ran"
"warm i would definitely recommend if"
"you're somebody who wants a"
"cool laptop to go with the model that"
"has the vent"
"along the top of the keyboard deck"
"because this vent"
"actually vents your laptop because the"
"fans are right here in the middle"
"okay so very important to consider"
"moving down to the keyboard deck it is"
"fantastic it's very reminiscent of the"
"hp"
"omen and if you've watched my channel"
"for a long time you know i'm a very big"
"fan boy"
"i like this simplified layout there is"
"no numpad which is great for creators it"
"just kind of gets in the way"
"but you also have your toggle switches"
"and you do have fingerprint sign in so"
"you can sign in with your fingerprint"
"now there is a button cutoff switch for"
"the webcam but there is not"
"a technically manual switch to cover it"
"so you just kind of have to trust that"
"it actually is turned off here is the"
"webcam test as you can tell it kind of"
"changes"
"colors but it has pretty good visuals"
"overall it'll be decent for you know"
"your average video conferencing"
"and also you can hear the audio here as"
"well the trackpad is good"
"it's not great only for the mere reason"
"that's a little bit loud"
"19 bigger than last year which is a big"
"upgrade"
"so this laptop continues to be made more"
"and more with a creator focus"
"in mind the screen is also a big upgrade"
"for creators this year you can get a 99"
"srgb screen that's a slight upgrade in"
"price but still for under a thousand"
"dollars with that upgrade"
"this laptop really shows off there's not"
"a lot of laptops"
"especially thin and light ones that are"
"under a thousand dollars that can get"
"that high of color gamut range"
"as mentioned in the intro this is the"
"ryzen 7 5700u model"
"with an upgrade to 16 gigs of ram which"
"in my opinion"
"is almost perfect for photoshop as you"
"see it really hits kind of the best bang"
"for buck"
"right around the 630 points range inside"
"of puget systems if you upgrade to 32"
"gigs"
"you're only going to get about a 60"
"point increase if you upgrade to 64 gigs"
"you're only gonna get about a hundred"
"point increase so really this is"
"optimized for creators in my opinion at"
"16 gigs of ram"
"which is great for the old budget if you"
"want more in-depth specs like running"
"the fan modes different ram"
"configurations for photo editing and"
"video editing"
"then definitely check out my dedicated"
"reviews for each of those types of use"
"case"
"jumping into the simulated benchmarks"
"this laptop really stands out even"
"amongst some of the big boys with the"
"high performance processors"
"and dedicated gpus checking out"
"cinebench r20"
"cinebench r23 and geekbench"
"single core and multi-core you can see"
"that it's really stepping it up and this"
"is not just"
"fanboy press like this laptop really"
"does"
"pack a punch hey there man why don't you"
"gently stroke that like button"
"helps us out a lot on this channel gets"
"more views to my beautiful chassis"
"appreciate it as i mentioned earlier if"
"you're thinking about after effects for"
"this laptop it's doable but because of"
"the lack of the dedicated gpu"
"the render scores were very low so"
"although it scores a decent after"
"effects score i would not recommend it"
"for that use case"
"now is this a 4k or 1080p video editing"
"laptop in my opinion 1080p is really the"
"sweet spot you're gonna have faster"
"export times"
"and much smoother playback but if you"
"really want to use it for 4k"
"know that at full quality playback in"
"premiere pro you're going to drop about"
"10"
"850 frames out of 16 177"
"but if you drop it down to half quality"
"for your you know playback timeline"
"you're gonna only drop 792. so if you do"
"it"
"your playback at half quality or fourth"
"quality could actually be"
"in good hands however the export time is"
"a little long at seven minutes"
"versus 1080p at about a minute 34."
"so the playback at 1080p is also"
"substantially better"
"at full quality you'll actually only"
"drop 236"
"frames with the 16 gigs of ram installed"
"so that's why i lean it more towards a"
"1080p video editing laptop versus 4k"

"what's up everybody this is Danny and"
"today I've partnered with HP to share"
"with you my experience of the 15 inch"
"envy x-360 laptop this is a two-in-one"
"convertible perfect for business and"
"everyday use it's available in a ton of"
"different configurations and starts"
"under $600 but you never know when sales"
"happen so make sure you hit that link"
"down below to check current pricing and"
"configuration options let's start with"
"the build of the 15-inch Envy x-360"
"laptop it's a nice metal build it feels"
"really solid it's easy to open with one"
"finger so that's always welcome due to"
"its larger size it's a little heavier at"
"slightly under 5 pounds but I've had no"
"problem putting it in my backpack so"
"even for students it's definitely"
"portable the hinges are solid on this"
"laptop"
"I love the design touches on the back"
"the best thing about the two-in-one form"
"factor is that you can use it like a"
"regular laptop then you can tint it to"
"watch movies and catch up on your"
"favorite content or you can just lay it"
"flat and use it like a tablet so the"
"flexibility is awesome especially if you"
"get the compatible pen I love that this"
"is a full HD touchscreen IPS display it"
"looks nice in laptop mode there is some"
"wobble when you touch the screen so if"
"you want the best touchscreen experience"
"I would suggest a tent mode or using it"
"in tablet mode it's not a deal-breaker"
"whatsoever I don't use the touchscreen"
"that much but when I do I did notice it"
"the display is brighter than a 13-inch"
"envy that I've reviewed earlier this"
"year so that's nice to see but you still"
"might have a problem seeing the screen"
"outside with the laptop due to the"
"glossy display and the overall"
"brightness but if you're primarily using"
"this inside at the office or at coffee"
"shops it definitely does the job I"
"watched a few movies on this laptop and"
"it looks good for the price point and"
"it's nice to have a larger 15 inch"
"display and since its IPs you do get"
"better viewing angles if you like"
"watching content on your laptop you'll"
"be happy with these speakers tuned by"
"Bang & Olufsen they are loud they sound"
"crisp nice and clear highs and mids I"
"wish it was a little bit more rounded"
"with some more bass but I think you're"
"gonna be really happy with the speakers"
"on the 15-inch"
"X 360 when it comes to ports you get a"
"nice selection on the left side you get"
"a DC in for charging I do love how HP"
"has slimmed down the power brick is a 65"
"watt charger but it's nice and portable"
"which"
"like get a USB 3.1 port a power button"
"ventilation grille and a headphone jack"
"and also a full-size SD card slot which"
"is awesome for content creators on the"
"right side you get an HDMI port another"
"USB 3.1 port a USB C port which is"
"awesome and yes you can charge the"
"laptop with the USB C port and with the"
"USB a and USB C port from that side you"
"can charge other devices such as laptops"
"and phones there's also a fingerprint"
"scanner on this model that I have so you"
"can securely login it does take getting"
"some used to with the positioning but it"
"works perfectly fine and there's also a"
"volume rocker there and on some models"
"you might see a webcam kill switch which"
"is a cool option for privacy the"
"keyboard layout includes the number pad"
"on the right side this is great for"
"business professionals that need this or"
"if you just prefer to have it there the"
"keyboard is nice and comfortable with"
"soft keys and lots of travel it's a"
"little too soft for my preference but"
"it's a comfortable keyboard the trackpad"
"is fairly responsive scrolling works"
"well for everyday use I do wish it was a"
"tad larger and wider but I think a lot"
"of people will be happy with this"
"trackpad there are plenty of power"
"options for the X 360 lineup you can go"
"all the way up to the 10th generation"
"Intel processors they are AMD rising"
"options as well and you can get"
"dedicated graphics up to the MX 250 so"
"you're gonna have to take a look and see"
"which configuration works best for you"
"the back is removable with some screws"
"that are hidden behind these rubber"
"bumpers but I wouldn't because most"
"things are not upgradable like Ram but"
"in terms of performance I can only talk"
"about the model that I have and this is"
"configured with the Intel quad core i7"
"85 65 u processor with 8 gigabytes of"
"RAM and a 256 gigabyte m2 SSD which has"
"nice speed by the way so opening"
"applications and overall performance is"
"nice everyday use like web browsing or"
"normal computing it's no problem so"
"office suite will work perfectly on here"
"this is not meant for gaming but you can"
"also casually game on the Intel 620"
"integrated graphics flight titles like"
"overwatch play surprisingly well on this"
"laptop but don't expect it to play"
"anything demanding in my testing with"
"everyday use the laptop has stayed very"
"cool so heat management is"
"good on this when you do play games the"
"fans do ramp up it does get a little bit"
"warm but I've never had it to the point"
"where it gets too warm to put on my lap"
"or anything like that I haven't done a"
"lot of demanding things like video"
"editing on here because honestly for the"
"type of work you'll need to bump up to a"
"better GPU but if you want to do some"
"photo editing or Photoshop or Lightroom"
"on this it's definitely doable on this"
"laptop so let's round this out with"
"battery life the 15-inch Envy x-360 has"
"a 56 watt hour battery and it's rated up"
"to 10 hours but I was getting between 5"
"to 7 hours of usage on mixed usage it"
"depends on what I had to display at so"
"if I kept the display at between 60 and"
"70% I was able to get about 6 hours of"
"usage but the good thing is the laptop"
"charges very fast what that included"
"charger so you'll be happy with that"
"so if you're looking for an affordable"
"two-in-one and you want that larger"
"15-inch display the HP x360 lineup could"
"be a good fit make sure you check that"
"link below because certain"
"configurations make this a really good"
"deal especially for the performance that"
"you're getting for that price so make"
"sure you scroll through and see if it"
"makes sense for you and then pick one up"
"if it does let me know what you think"
"about this laptop and let me know which"
"other laptops that you may take a look"
"at next and I will see you in the next"
"one"
"his is Lisa from mobile tech review and"
"this is the HP Envy x-360 13-inch are"
"the 13 z model specifically HP has been"
"been doing great things with the envy"
"and it gets even better in part because"
"we have the new AMD rise in 4000 series"
"CPU inside otherwise known as n2 or"
"renoir r very fast"
"excellent performance there and keeps"
"the price reasonable but beyond that"
"they've done a redesign just like they"
"did with the spectre x360 last year so"
"this distance over here is over 17"
"millimeters shorter and it reduces the"
"bottom chin bezel that used to be kind"
"of large beyond that you've got a metal"
"casing they call this nightfall black"
"all aluminum casing nice full HD display"
"options we're gonna look at it now but"
"now a shout-out to our sponsor Trend"
"Micro and their home network security"
"device this is just a little over $100"
"and it's really easy to set up just plug"
"in the included Ethernet cable into your"
"router plug it into power and it does"
"more than just firewall you know it is a"
"firewall - it protects your Internet of"
"Things device and so that means all the"
"smart devices that you have your ring"
"doorbells your alexa this and that your"
"robotic vacuum cleaner all that stuff"
"it's gonna protect it it's gonna make"
"sure that nobody tries to hack in also"
"it has parental control so this is great"
"for family management especially with"
"kids being at home so much right now"
"you can check to make sure they're not"
"using apps that they shouldn't be using"
"and also can set timers so basically in"
"10 o'clock at night no more YouTube for"
"you you get the idea there and it also"
"blocks malicious files and malicious"
"websites to some and again very easy to"
"manage Android Apple smartphone it"
"doesn't matter both of those are gonna"
"work just fine and there's another bonus"
"it also protects your router which is"
"pretty good because your ISP throws a"
"router at you and never updates it again"
"now back to our video so this is one"
"heck of a tiny 13.3 inch ultra buck I"
"tell you HP and Dell are just in a"
"battle at the XPS line you know versus"
"the envy and the specter has to who can"
"make the smallest one they say it's the"
"footprint of your old school 11 inch"
"laptop and they're not lying it looks"
"tiny it's also very attractive-looking"
"given the price tag that's pretty darn"
"nice"
"you get an aluminum casing here and one"
"nice black and you get a full HD IPS"
"display that's the only display option"
"and that's fair because our model nicely"
"equipped it's got the rise in five"
"inside and it's got eight gigs of RAM"
"and 256 gig SSD is selling for around"
"seven hundred and sixty nine dollars and"
"it looks very premium so good that now"
"if you want to spend even less there is"
"a risin three and rise ins kind of"
"trying to parallel Intel Core i3 i5 and"
"i7 with their nomenclature and that one"
"is eight gigs ram an old 128 gig SSD I"
"would GOG to the rise in five if you can"
"afford it it's not too much of a big"
"jump in price you could go up to a risin"
"7 16 gigs of ram is the max and you can"
"even go up to a one terabyte SSD if you"
"want i'm regardless of which one you're"
"gonna get it to nvme SSD with reasonable"
"good speed so that's a lot of niceness"
"for the price here so HP is really got"
"almost threatening their own spectre"
"x360 line here because you're getting"
"the metal chassis and all that sort of"
"thing but for those who want some of the"
"added niceties like a 4k display for"
"example or Thunderbolt 3 then the"
"spectre is still there for you not to"
"mention that edgy design which is pretty"
"cool-looking on him so the spice"
"supports pen and touch the pen is not in"
"the box here it's Microsoft pin protocol"
"2.0 otherwise known as entry seeing it"
"HP's pen these days are selling one"
"that's USB C rechargeable you could use"
"a Microsoft Surface pro pendant as well"
"with it if you wanted to they build this"
"more for note-taking and that's"
"appropriate and trig is little less"
"smooth when it comes to things like"
"diagonal line jitter and all that stuff"
"that artists care about it's fine for"
"note-taking in the palm rejection it's"
"pretty good these days"
"obviously there are 360 degree hinges"
"here because this is a convertible ultra"
"book and for those of you who like all"
"this but want a 15-inch laptop they"
"actually make it in the 15-inch size to"
"in similar specs and similar pricing"
"some other niceties are webcam privacy"
"switch there's a fingerprint scanner in"
"the keyboard the power button is right"
"next to the Delete key on the keyboard"
"that to me is not the most brilliant"
"decision but hey and they have a quick"
"launch button for the HP command center"
"which I mostly use for the thermal"
"profiles there's their version of"
"optimizer balance"
"as a high-performance mode which in our"
"test didn't make actually that much of a"
"difference and a couple of super quiet"
"kind of settings now the the start here"
"is going to be this year's a.m. the rise"
"in 4000 series CPU so we have the rise"
"in used series ultrabook 15 watt CPUs"
"with AMD Radeon Vega 8 graphics which"
"are about like Intel iris + graphic g7"
"graphics so you don't have to go for the"
"highest end core i7 and Intel and just"
"to get that kind of similar graphics"
"performance here for less money nice"
"then we have the risin 5 4500 you and"
"this is a good performer at benchmarks"
"closer to an Intel Core i7 10th chin"
"very nice and the other good thing about"
"the Rison is that the performance in"
"terms of thermals the heat and the"
"battery life are also excellent which is"
"new for rise in CPUs for this generation"
"finally they got there and they did a"
"good job of it some went running"
"benchmarks and doing more demanding"
"tasks like handbrake video and codes and"
"all that sort of thing CPU temperatures"
"typically maxed out around 85 centigrade"
"whereas Intel we'd see more like 95"
"centigrade so that's good the cooling"
"here is not quite as effective as it is"
"on the Lenovo IdeaPad flex 15 with the"
"same CPU but that's a 14-inch chassis"
"bigger laptop a little more room for"
"cooling and I wouldn't make my buying"
"decision on that because this one's"
"still running cool enough you improve"
"thermals here versus Intel also mean"
"you're gonna hear the fan a lot less"
"often if you push it hard you'll hear it"
"ultra book fan you know that Shh"
"not a roaring or anything like that I"
"don't think most people would be"
"bothered by it it is thin it is metal I"
"didn't find that he got hot to the touch"
"though the u series CPUs are 50 watt"
"they're not the super powerful mobile"
"workstation style CPU so I didn't find"
"any burning hot spots on the laptop even"
"when doing things like benchmarking so"
"good then in terms of ports you've got"
"USB 8 points you've got your micro SD"
"card slot skinny laptop here in the USBA"
"ports or what they call drop jog little"
"drop-down hinges on them because it's"
"too thin to just put the USB a port"
"without doing them and we have USB C and"
"that is Gen 2 and supports DisplayPort"
"and it supports power delivery though"
"this comes with a barrel pin charging"
"including"
"USBC charger if you wanted so no"
"Thunderbolt 3 here in part because"
"Thunderbolt 3 was Intel's intellectual"
"property now it's opening up in the"
"future we'll probably see what they AMD"
"but given the price you don't expect to"
"see Thunderbolt 3 and something that's"
"selling for 650 or 769 dollars you can"
"use USB C docks so that's a go in terms"
"of display no matter what you go with"
"here they have three options you're"
"still gonna get full HD IPS and there's"
"gonna support the pen and touch now they"
"have a 300 in which we haven't seen in"
"person the 400 nits which is the one"
"that we have which really goes way over"
"400 nits it's nice to see this happening"
"with manufacturers exceeding their"
"claims and there's also a 1000 that"
"privacy display which we've seen on the"
"HP Spectre series it's mostly very"
"bright to deal with the privacy screen"
"functionality on its own yeah"
"it's a good despite honestly here we"
"have full srgb coverage which is nice to"
"see and we have better than average"
"contrast ratio you can see the specs on"
"screen it's reasonably well calibrated"
"from the factory - it's a pleasure than"
"of screen and it's and color accurate"
"enough screen that it's enjoyable as"
"ever with HP laptop cell boy is a"
"glossing plenty of reflection and glare"
"the keyboard on this is backlit and"
"white you know two levels of"
"backlighting and it doesn't have a lot"
"of travel it's a super skinny laptop"
"it's okay though the tactile feel on"
"this is pretty good and as we all get"
"adjusted to these lower travel keyboards"
"it's fine it's not weird of short travel"
"just average short travel keyboard we"
"have a Microsoft precision trackpad on"
"board it behaves perfectly well it's a"
"slightly rough service you can actually"
"hear your finger going across it like a"
"little cheat I like that it gives you"
"traction so you're not like skating"
"across the track Ben works fine no"
"stereo banging olsen brand and speakers"
"here with HP's software to amp up the"
"sound and given how tiny this thing it"
"is it actually has some bass which is"
"impressive and plenty of volume on board"
"this is a 51 watt hour battery which is"
"a good sized capacity battery here and"
"it comes with a 65 watt fast charger"
"that can charge it up to 50% in 30"
"minutes"
"again it's the barrel pin kind of"
"connector you could use USB charger if"
"you wanted to"
"HP claims I'm almost 12 hours for"
"Netflix streaming in almost 13 hours for"
"web browsing and that's what the"
"brightness set to 150 minutes and as"
"always a little optimistic there and"
"with web browsing and they mean edge and"
"on Chrome which is more resource"
"intensive they mean and a few tabs open"
"and not 25 tabs open in your web browser"
"but I found on average that we were"
"managing 9 to 10 hours with a charge"
"that's really good Rison is really"
"leading the way here with some reduced"
"power consumption and good performance"
"so what about this versus the ideal"
"anova IdeaPad flex 15 or so lenovo is a"
"40 inch laptop versus this being a 13.3"
"inch so in part that does depend on your"
"preferred screen size not that there's a"
"huge huge difference both at full HD"
"displays both have the same rise in CPU"
"options but the display on the HP is"
"much better much wider color damage full"
"srgb versus only 65% of srgb also higher"
"contrast so that stands in this favor"
"I like the Lenovo keyboard feel a little"
"bit better but I like the looks at the"
"end me better in the fact that it has an"
"aluminum casing on it whereas lenovo's"
"it's plastic so this one just feels more"
"classy and looks a little prettier to my"
"eye not that looks for everything but"
"they influenced us all now here's"
"something that I always consider a"
"negative with HP's consumer laptops the"
"skinny ones like the spectre x360 and"
"this envy they call them not user"
"serviceable what that really means is"
"you have to pull off the rubber strips"
"on the bottom and the adhesive is kind"
"of cranky you might not get it back on"
"there again to access the screws that"
"hold the bottom plate on I'm not gonna"
"bother opening this one out mostly"
"because like all ultrabooks the RAM is"
"soldered on the only thing you can"
"replace is the m2 SSD if you want to put"
"a bigger one in or a faster one in and"
"the Wi-Fi card is socketed but since"
"it's an intel Wi-Fi 6 8 X 200 card which"
"is a very good car do you probably are"
"not going to want to replace that so"
"that's the HP Envy x-360 13-inch model"
"with AMD inside it's hard to find"
"anything to complain about given the"
"price in this latch I began a metal"
"chassis you get quite a pleasing IPS"
"display here at least with our 400 nits"
"model haven't seen the 300 in person to"
"set a good decent keyboard on a very"
"nice trackpad performance that's"
"excellent"
"design that's very yummy yes you don't"
"get thunder both free and in part that"
"has to do with AMD but really mostly it"
"has to do with the price if you want"
"thunderbolt three there's the next jump"
"up which is the spectre x360 of their"
"most premium model very nice overall"
"I'll miss it for mobile tech review be"
"sure to subscribe to our YouTube channel"
"for more cool tech videos and thumbs up"
"if you like this man"
"one of the many benefits of having your"
"own youtube channel is the unique"
"ability to be able to review many"
"products and because our channel is a"
"technology channel we were lucky enough"
"to get our hands on an hp mv x360 201"
"laptop and we're super excited to open"
"this up and take a look at the laptop"
"i'm going to give you a few of the main"
"specs for this particular laptop this hp"
"laptop runs on the amd ryzen 7. it has"
"12 gigs of ddr4 ram it comes with a 512"
"gig solid-state hard drive and this"
"model does not come with an optical"
"drive but the upside this model is"
"pre-loaded with windows 11. this model"
"is a 15.6 full hd led touchscreen and"
"this laptop comes with bang olufsen"
"speakers so it should sound good and"
"lastly this has a fingerprint reader to"
"unlock the laptop so enough chit chat"
"let's get this thing out of the box and"
"test it"
"and here's the laptop fresh out of the"
"box"
"and the retail price for this laptop was"
"749 at costco as of february 2022"
"and the first time you start up your new"
"laptop you'll most likely have to update"
"it and then connect your microsoft"
"account and then you can start"
"customizing your windows home screen"
"first thing i want to show you is the"
"bezel"
"i love this bezel on the side here i"
"love this how thin it is i do wish it"
"would look like that all the way around"

"get three speakers and hp audio boost"
"now let's test the keyboard the sound of"
"the keyboard"
"it's pretty it's not very loud i like it"
"i think if you"
"wouldn't be annoying if"
"someone was sleeping next to somebody in"
"a bed they were beyond doing this you"
"wouldn't hear it as much i mean it's"
"definitely got some noise to it but it's"
"not loud so the keyboard is not loud i"
"like that"
"once again there's a fingerprint"
"sensor here to unlock this with the"
"fingerprint we have not set that up yet"
"but we will"
"let's see here now this is the test i"
"like doing this little test here can you"
"open the screen with one finger"
"and success"
"and that means these hinges are smooth"
"and not too tight it's awesome i like"
"doing that"
"so that's a really good sign"
"okay let's go ahead and flip this"
"because this actually can be a two in"
"one here"
"so like this now"
"like that"
"so you can prop it up"
"like this straight aside"
"like that"
"and then if you want"
"put this on your lap you do it this way"
"and because once this is turned around"
"the keyboard is not working so you have"
"to worry about the keys being pushed"
"here you can hear them i'm pushing them"
"nothing's going on so that's good so"
"it's more like a tablet here it's a"
"thick tablet"
"i want to talk about the weight"
"of this laptop it's kind of heavy i got"
"to be honest this is one of the more"
"heavier laptops that i've seen at this"

"and over 12 hours of video playback"
"we charged our laptop right out of the"
"box and we have yet to charge it again"
"and we're on day number three and that's"
"pretty impressive for battery life"
"because battery life is my one pet peeve"
"about laptops it always seems that"

"in the video graphics or amd radeon"
"graphics integrated"
"very impressive"
"[Music]"
"for 749 i was not expecting this quality"
"but it's a home run"
"so now the last thing we're going to do"

"out of this you got 12 gigs of ram"
"can't go wrong with that it's a good"
"number to have so i did i do wish it"
"would have had a bigger hard drive one"
"terabyte should be standard nowadays for"
"most"
