What I love about this sunscreen is that:- Unlike many other products that claim to control oil, this actually makes me less oily and stays matte for a long time- Goes well under a little makeupWhat I hate:- Burns around the eyes, especially when I wash it off- It's very hard to spread and you need time to work it on- sometimes it pills and sticks to baby hairs- Leaves a bit of a white cast. It's not too obvious on my "light medium" skin tone but I wouldn't recommend this for tan or deep skin tones
It works well and doesn't feel greasy or look shiny.  BUT I would not advise using it on your forehead if you'll be sweating (I don't know about swimming) because it WILL run and get in your eyes and it WILL NOT feel good.  Yes, this is true of many sunscreens, but this one seems to be worse than average in this regard.So yes, use it.  It works.  It's good.  But be aware you may need to use a different product above the eyes.
I was using another system for acne that included sunscreen but it was very “oily”. I purchased this as a replacement & I love it!
Easy spreading, daily use!
Its a good product, it just has a strange smell .
my skin loves this sunscreen, it feels moisturizing and lightweight and it’s perfect to wear under makeup!
This sunscreen texture is great for my acne prone skin.
Great for oily skin cuz it absorbs oil well so not very moisturizing.
This is the only sunscreen that doesn’t make me break out!
Does a good job for hours of activity
Love this sunscreen, it really is non-greasy and doesn't make your face shine.  Amazon had a good price when I bought it.
Love love love
This sunscreen is definitely not for oily skin, easy to spread but stinks the eye area a little bit. You need to try it first to see if it’s really suitable for you. Also it doesn’t leave white cast
Not the worst but I've tried better. Took forever to rub in but definitely made me very dewy and my skin looked amazing. No white or grey cast and no bad scent either! Would recommend I just got tired of rubbing for so long.
Absolute baseline of a product for the money it wears like a 28$ dollar plus product without the fancy branding. I mix mine with after shave lotion when I’m done shaving.
After trying a ton of sunscreens, I think I have finally found my white whale. You cannot beat this price for a sunscreen that soaks in as well as this does. It’s easy to wear under make up, and won’t cause breakouts. I had been using Elta and Intellishade, but will use this exclusively moving forward.
I use this daily and I have noticed a big change in my skin. My skin doc recommends this and he agrees my skin is looking better. I am 70 and have very few wrinkle to begin with, and using this keeps my face soft and I never get sun burns or tan.
Works great! Does not leave any white residue & does not leave your face oily.
Good value, lightweight and easy to apply
it is a sunscreen but more so for the beach. It DOES leave a white cast on dark skin but it is minimal. I used with a light moisturizer and this somehow made my face feel DRYER than before. it spreads with difficulty
Only sunscreen that doesn't, make your skin oily. Some sunscreens by time becomes caky or oily. but this one by time makes my face better. I even use it in the evening when there is no sun. But since they changed formula it started to leave white cast when applied big amount. You need precisely control the amount you put.
it is good but upon application it touched my eyes with alot of tears came. Avoid near eyes
I appreciate the sunscreen for not being greasy compared to the many other brands of sunscreens I've used before. But reapplying it to my face is not always great, leaving my face to white or leaving some white spots here and there.
I was looking for sunblock to use while walking around my city (not the beach). This sunblock is works great, is fragrance free and feels light weight.  The only negative is that it is thick to apply, a white cream that you will really need to rub in well. I wish they could make this in "clear" . Otherwise, a good purchase that does not turn your skin albino weight as the chemical frees tend to do.
fits perfectly on your skin, does not become too white, and also not greasy, great to use in the morning in your daily routine
I don't know why I had problems with this sunscreen, which has chemical filters. It shouldn't have had a cast, but DID on me (Asian). I found it so hard to spread evenly, and it does not dry down SHEER, you have to really work it out to get it even, because you will be left with white streaks if you don't.Even when I did apply it evenly, I still looked a little like a ghost.I bought this to travel to Colorado, which is soo dry, but if really wasn't moisturizing, almost a little drying (which makes sense because IT IS for people with more oily skin). However, MY PROBLEM was that when I applied it over moisturizer, sometimes it piled, or left more intense white streaks on my face.
My husband hates lotion. Sunscreen, hand cream, whatever -- if it gets rubbed into skin, he hates it. We recently took a trip to Disney and I brought this along for my own use because I'm prone to breakouts, and this ended up being our family's default sunscreen for the trip. It rubs in easily, smells mild, and we had zero sunburns despite being out for hours at a time for an entire week at a theme park. We used most of the tube over the week of travel, which isn't bad for three people with multiple applications a day. I'm definitely getting this again to use all summer long.
This sunscreen is not as oily as many others I've tried, doesn't irritate my skin, fragrance free, and much more affordable than other options. Will keep buying!
XOXOXOXOXOXO!!!!!!
This sunscreen is gray for my oily skin. No blemishes come from it, it’s not greasy, and leaves a matte look
No ugly white residue
honestly this is my favorite part of my skincare routine, maybe because it’s the end of it, but it also feels so nice. (with the exception of it getting into my eyes), one bottle has lasted me about 6 months, and it doesn’t make me feel oily at all, when i go outside after applying it really feels like i have spf on. :)
Product is good and works well.  This purchase was disappointing as the sunscreen smells musty. Would not buy from this supplier again.
Better than using ordinary moisturizer under makeup
Excellent sun product. Most products break me out this one keeps my skin absolutely clear.  The cream does the job and is very fair in price. It’s creamy and yet dries rapidly and it has an pleasant smell.
It’s a good sunscreen but after a couple of minutes with it on, my face is already oily.
:)
It spread so easily and leave little to no residue
I figured if this was good enough for my face it’s good enough for the rest of my body! Absorbs quickly and does not feel like you are covered in sunscreen.
Well for starters it’s making little to no change in my skin. It’s oxybenzone  free which is supposed be good for me because I have dark skin. But it still cast a white shadow. I don’t know why but when I spread it across my face it also like curdles and it’s like how it is with like dead skin but it’s with the product. I don’t really know how to explain it well.
Love this face sunscreen so much. I have skin on the oily side anyway and this doesn’t make my face greasy or cause me to break out. Would highly recommend.
I have pretty durable and un-sensitive skin (i.e. my skin doesn't flare up, burn, or itch to most products), but am horrendously prone to acne and hyperpigmentation, and most sunscreens are really thick and make my face feel pretty sealed up and unbreathable. This sunscreen is probably the best I've come across so far.It still has the usual odor and consistency of typical sunscreens, although it is slightly more fluid and subtle so a small amount can be applied easily and my skin can still breathe. Once applied, it does leave a little bit of a shine (but not nearly as much as regular sunscreens), but I think that's a fair trade for protected skin. A thin layer of it won't leave your skin looking white/pale either but an ample or generous amount will (ample being a teaspoon-full).Applying makeup after isn't any issue either, granted that you either rub the sunscreen in thoroughly and allow at least of couple of minutes for it to settle. I use liquid foundation but for those who use powders, you might have to wait longer for it "dry".As stated in the description, application is necessary at least every 2 hours, or every 80 minutes if you're in water or sweating.I prefer to wash it off as soon as I'm no longer outdoors, but I have left it on for an extended period (6-7 hours) and didn't feel my skin becoming too oily as it would with any other sunscreen. I didn't break out from it either, which is a plus, and I've been using it almost every day.FYI for sunscreens in general, many common ingredients of sunscreen like avobenzone and homosalate (included in this product as well) are good at either filtering, blocking, or absorbing UV, UVA, UVB rays, which is great, but I would highly recommend washing it off as soon as you no longer need the protection. Like everything else in this world, the sunscreen isn't infinite - it's made of molecules and chemicals that will break down into other compounds. These ingredients in sunscreen have been found to breakdown into a variety of organic compounds, some of which that can cause cancer - I'm not saying that this guaranteed and will happen to you, but be wary of leaving it on your face for extended periods of time. I don't know the details of how long these ingredients typically last in their intact UV protecting state, but by guessing from the product description stating that it should be reapplied at least every 2 hours, my guess would be that - a couple hours. So overall, just make sure you're cleaning it off properly. Cleansing oils and cleansing balms are useful for removing oil-based materials like sunscreen.
I kinda liked it cuz it was easy to spread on face and it’s light weight you don’t feel to heavy on your face 🤗and it is moisturizing 👍
I have sensitive acne prone skin and this gave me good protection without breaking out my skin. I also used it under makeup and it didn't affect the look of my makeup even hours later.
I ordered this product because I was looking for a sunscreen that didn't have Oxybenzone in it. It causes hormone disruption in humans, affecting estrogen production particularly in women and testosterone production in men. It also bleaches coral reefs and can cause mortality in fish. Now think about that being absorbed into your skin, not so good right?Anyway, that's why I went for this because it's FREE of oxybenzone and much more affordable than others options such as Paula's choice which has an Oxybenzone-free sunscreen too. Please note, from what I can gather it's only the SPF 30 that is free of it, not the SPF 55.The product is oil free so it's great for oily skin and I'll say once it's dried in it doesn't feel very moisturising, it has a dry feel to it probably because it's mineral based.Overall I'm giving it a 4/5, it's a GREAT price that is free of a toxic chemical (also linked to cancer) with a reasonable SPF level. Definitely a great daily sun screen that doesn't break me out. It looks like it will have a white cast but if you blend it in that disappears. I'll update this tomorrow with it's compatibility with makeup cause I'll be putting some under my foundation and seeing how it feels.
I use this twice a day and I never have a rash or break out from this brand of sunscreen! Love this stuff!
I just had a Dermal Cell removed and needed to make sure this doesn't happen again. I never used sunscreen on my face since my makeup had it. But it's so important to use a sunscreen/block before adding your makeup for double protection. This Neutrogena cream goes on smoothly and disappears into the skin.. Then the makeup just glides right over.  This says it's clear, but it's white. It still blends right in with no white residue or shine, just a nice matte finish.  I'll be buying more.
First time using this brand, wanted to compare it to a tinted mineral sunscreen I also bought. I favor the tinted one (Australian Gold) but this one worked amazing well for being outside at a water park all day for July 4! I applied it two or three times and my face was wonderfully tan but not burned whatsoever! I am fair skinned with an olive skin tone. Need to rub this sunscreen in more than the other brand I tried. One thing I did notice is that this one made my face feel prickly, not super fun, but half the people who used it that day in my group also felt that slight burning sensation. I'm not sure if that's a sensitivity/allergy to some ingredient in it but it didn't leave any weird redness or marks on my skin, no breakouts, no sunburn, and the feeling went away after a few minutes. All in all, pretty happy that I brought that along!
This is a very affordable and good sun protection that I have ever you in US. The one thing I don’t like is that sometime it can not combine well with several moisturizer skin care that I use.
Wore it for the hot Puerto Rican sun for two weeks and wow usually sunscreen mixed with sweat and you skin is so broken out.  On my very sensitive combination skin it worked so well breakout free I was shocked
I was looking yet again for a facial sunscreen for summer to use under makeup.  I'm not very faithful about using sunscreen.  I know I should be, yet living up north and being one who stays indoors a lot, I don't worry about it like I should.  But when summer comes, I try to wear one most days.  But I hate the way they feel, and every year I am on the hunt for one that is not greasy or heavy, won't cause breakouts, and works well under makeup.  And is not expensive, to boot.  That seems to be a really hard combination to find.  The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer is sort of close, but  I still find it feels to greasy and heavy on my skin.  I gave this one a try this year, and I really like it. As I apply it, I feel like oh no, this is going to be greasy and heavy, too.  But no, as soon as I am done applying, it disappears.  I really don't feel it on my skin after that.  It doesn't leave a white cast once it is applied, and it works well under my makeup.  It seems to offer great sun protection.  I am very fair and burn easily and I have had no problems.  It is a generously sized tube for the price.  I use it on my neck and chest, as well.  I have had no problem with my eyes stinging as I use it under them.  Of course, I am careful not to get it my eyes.  No new pimples since using it, no rashes or other irritation either.  I think it's a good product, and I recommend it.
I've been using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock on my face for a few years; it is really good.  But when I saw this "Clear Face" version, I decided to try it.  I actually prefer this Clear Face because it is so sheer feeling & oil-free.  They are NOT the same product and feel different when applied.I like it because it disappears in to my skin, leaving it matte, not shiny at all.  The Ultra Sheer is a bit more like a lotion. It's not greasy but does leave a feeling of lotion on my face.  This Clear Face is so light, I hardly know I'm wearing it.  Even my husband likes it & that is saying something because he is not a lotion-on-the-face kind of guy.  And there is virtually no scent which is great since it's on your face where you really notice scent.When you first put this on, it's quite white/watery & you may think it's a disaster but... just lightly smooth it in & it disappears quickly.  And it does block the sun.  I have no burning when I wear this sunscreen.If you have sensitive skin, this may not be the product for you.  I felt a slight "burning" sensation when I applied it.  It went away quickly but I could see that being a problem for some people.  I also got a little on my lips & they still felt slightly irritated the next day.  The ingredient list is interesting & includes "cinnamomum zeylanicum bark extract" which is from the cinnamon tree and "cedrus atlantica bark extract" which is from a cedar tree.  Both have antiseptic properties which is probably why they are in this "clear face" lotion.  But they can also cause irritation so if you have very sensitive skin, beware. The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock does not contain either of those ingredients and may be a better choice for you.
Very good!!! I like this product!!!
This stuff is great! It's  more like a nice facial moisturizer than a sun screen, it's very light and non greasy. It is my new go to daily spf facial moisturizer. Very good product, and super affordable protection from the sun. 👍👍😁
product is about to expire
It does its job!
This works well as far as I can tell and goes on relatively easily. It was highly rated and attractively priced.
If you're using powerful retinoids, you must also use sun protection every single day. My son has acne, so we had to be sure that we chose something effective that wouldn't cause breakouts. This Neutrogena sunscreen doesn't irritate his skin and it's clear and undetectable so he doesn't feel weird having "stuff" on his face. I'd recommend for anyone prone to breakouts.
Really like this. Goes on smooth and even. Not greasy.
I’ve been wanting to add sunscreen into my skin care routine but was scared of breaking out. My sister referred me to this brand. No break outs, I don’t feel gross or sticky when it’s on. The protection is there without the extra feel or smell of sunscreen!
This may well be a very good product. It just was not good for my skin. I still broke out. I have not used it much so I don’t have a good opinion for you.
Absorbs quickly and doesn’t feel great or cause breakouts. Great sun protection
I've used Neutrogena for years, happy with this product.
Is not greasy - goes on smoothGood protectionLove Neutrogena products
I love Neutrogena products. I know I can always trust them. This product doesn't clog my pores, which is important since I have awful, acne prone skin. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because when I use it on top of my Benzoyl peroxide, it burns. Bad. But this could just be me unknowingly combining chemicals?? I don't know. I've never had this problem before. But not a bad product and I definitely recommend.
I’ve trusted many Neutrogena products for about 30 years now, especially Norwegian Formula hand cream in winter.My dermatologist recommends this so he didn’t have to twist my arm. The primary thing that I like is that it spreads easily. I’m sure it does the trick on sunblocking but I have no way of claiming it’s SPF properties
This is a fantastic product for the face
It’s very lightweight and easy to ply. I have use this with foundation, it didn’t work for me. So i would recommend not doing that.
I really, really wanted to like this as much as the majority of reviewers seem to; unfortunately, however, in my opinion this did not live up to the hype. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't great either. For reference, I have very oily, acne-prone skin.PROS:~ Offers hard-core broad-spectrum protection with myriad types of sunscreens.~ Doesn't leave a white cast.~ Nice consistency, light feeling.~ Works well under makeup and with other products.~ Decent price.CONS:~ All of the sunscreens used are chemical sunscreens, which is a bit odd, since physical sunscreens are less irritating than chemical ones (and as all acne-prone people know, irritation leads to breakouts!). Moreover, not only is zinc oxide (a physical sunscreen) non-irritating and non-comedogenic/non-acnegenic, it can actually help to treat and prevent breakouts. So it's odd that they didn't use it in this sunscreen for acne-prone skin and instead exclusively used sunscreens that at best are irritating and at worst comedogenic, which is the opposite of what this product is supposed to do.~ Probably because of the aforementioned point, this sunscreen seemed to be no better at preventing breakouts than any other facial sunscreen. It's not really any worse than most other facial sunscreens, either; however, considering that it's primary claim is that it won't cause breakouts, it's frustrating that that's not the case.~ The claim that this leaves your skin matte is complete b.s., at least in my experience. In fact, literally just now as I was writing this review, my boyfriend asked me if I'm okay, because my face is so shiny that it looks like I'm drenched with sweat. Awesome.... NOT the look I was going for!!!!!!~ This could easily be something that only I experience, but for me, if I use this sunscreen multiple days in a row, my skin starts burning like crazy when I put it on. Not sun-burning, mind you, but really harsh stinging, as though I've just had an intense chemical peel or am using a heavy-duty retinoid. Not sure what causes it to burn like that, because my skin is by no means sensitive. Because of this, I alternate it with another sunscreen and use it only every other day or every third day.Final note: Of course, skin care products work differently on different people. Obviously this product worked very well for the majority of reviewers. So I'd recommend giving it a chance, even though I personally was not wowed.
Love it helps so much
Great
This is non greasy and blends in super easy. It’s highly moisturizing and makes your skin look great
Of course it smells like sunscreen which isn’t my favorite scent, but it applies easily and hasn’t broken me out. That’s all I can ask for since I got serious about sunscreen after being prescribed tretinoin for my acne.
This has been my favorite sunblock for 5 years to my face. I have a acne prone skin and this is the only sunscreen oil free than I know. I tested much before but it’s is cheap and it have a fast dry without white trail over my face.
I am happy that I purchased this item. I have a medium to dark-skinned complexion with a mix of t-zone oil and dryness in the other areas of my face. I am giving this information because I find it useful to know the skin type and complexion when I purchase an item. I used to use the Visibly Even® Daily Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 for years to help with my hyperpigmentation, but then I stopped because I relocated to the northwest where it was more shaded and rainy, and it also left my face feeling greasy throughout the day even under my makeup. However, let me tell you that the sun's rays still penetrated the clouds, and I began to experience hyperpigmentation again in my face. So I switched to this product, the Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen for Acne-Prone Skin, Broad Spectrum SPF 55. I LOVE IT! There is a slight white film that is on the face after the initial application, but it fades quickly. The sunblock is thick, a little goes a long way, it works well whether I wear makeup and it does not seem to encourage the oil. I doubt a greasy nose or t-zone will ever change for me, but I use other products to reduce it.  I am delighted.I hope this review helps someone else.
This product dries fast and never travels into my eyes, like the gooey sunscreens do.  I apply makeup over it.  The makeup also has a little sunscreen, so I'm protected to 50 SPF total.  This product also feels good on my neck, hands, and arms.  I'm super careful now and wear sunscreen almost everyday, except when I go out at night, because I had THREE surgeries in seven wks to remove basal cell carcinoma off the end of my nose and two more surgeries to successfully graft skin to cover the hole = like a sunroof on the end of my nose.  I've worn sunscreen since the 1970's and no one in my family has had cancer, so I didn't think I'd get it - WRONG!  Did you know you can get the harmful rays THROUGH the driver's side window even if it's tinted?  That's why so many facial and neck skin cancers are on the LEFT side!  This product doesn't cause breakouts, which is another problem I had with oily sunscreens.  This is the 4th container I've purchased, because my husband wears it also EVERYDAY!
The best sunscreen cream I have ever try!! My freckles stopped appearing.  Highly recommend!!!
I have tried many sunscreens from different brands (in different countries) and have found this one as the best one for daily use. It absorbs nicely and leaves no greasy/shiny finish. It is also very comfortable to wear, even in warm weather, making it easy to reapply as often as one should. I have tried the 30spf and 55spf and find the latter to burn a bit when my skin is irritated due to the acne products I use. Nonetheless, this always goes away, have not experienced this with the 30 one. Be aware that it will burn A LOT if it gets in your eyes (as any American sunscreen tbh). Using a kids sunscreen around the eyes solves the problem.
Amazing products works so great
I bought this product and was skeptical because I have can prone skin, and most sunscreen is very oily. My skin becomes red very easily, and I am usually hesitant to try new products. This has become my favorite face product, and has actually helped my acne. It is not oily at all, in fact I apply it twice daily (once in the morning and in the afternoon). My face usually becomes very red or pink from the sun, which would irritate my skin. Since I started using this, I have had less acne and I notice the texture of my skin is better. My smile lines have even faded a bit since the sun protection is great! I have not burned at all with this product and I have spent long days in intense sun while wearing it. It does not make my skin look pale after application either! You should absolutely buy this product!!
Blends in well
I never write reviews, but I am a bit skeptical about this product. On the left is one I purchased from a store in person (maybe CVS) and the one on the right is from Amazon. The one I purchased in person is one I've been using for a while and it works well on my skin. I am a black woman and was looking for a sunscreen that doesn't make me look ashy and this works. My issue with the Amazon one is that it looks like a fake/imitation and could be the reason it's burning some customers who left reviews of such and has not worked for others. I could be wrong, but the packaging is noticeably different. The image used when you want to purchase it, is the same as the one I purchased in person, but when it arrived, the font is smaller and words are added and moved around. I checked the back of the product and it's all the same, but the print is smaller. The packaging is also slightly smaller and I don't know why and is discouraging me from using it on my skin. Most importantly my face. Use with caution. ⚠
This is a very uh, poignant smelling sunscreen. Super sheen and works to perfection, just keep in mind you’ve gotta get over the mental hurdle of breathing in that sweet, sweet SPF all day.
Seems to work! It doesn’t leave a ghostly appearance on my face like other sunscreens.Smells like chemical sunscreen but that beats skin cancer, thinking that smell can be offset too by laying normal face cream over it.Does make my face super shiny too; but…like I said if I’m going to spend time in the sun I’ll use this and accept the downsides bc skin cancer would be worse.
I use this product mainly on my arms, legs, and body for activities in the sun. It works well and affords about as much protection as one may expect from a sunscreen. I work horseback in the sun, and find Neutrogena products superior to other brands I have used. It should be reapplied occasionally for full protection - how often depends on the activity, intensity of sunlight, and how much perspiration or water is involved in the activity. The lotion should be used in adequate amounts. it goes on smoothly and comfortably and is not greasy, though any - and I mean ANY -  sunscreen will affect clothing if it comesin contact with clothes regularly. For my face I use Neutrogena Sport face, which is thicker and lasts a bit longer. The Sport Face has a higher SPF, but I  don't believe there is much difference in protection above 55. NOTE: No sunscreen will replace proper sun clothing, such as long sleeves and a brimmed hat. These are not always practical for me (for example, I wear a riding helmet), so the sunscreen is essential. Remember that a baseball cap does not protect your neck, most of your face, or your ears. Also, reflected sunlight can be as damaging as direct sun, so I wear sunscreen whenever I'm outdoors for more than a few minutes.
I don’t hate this sunscreen but it definitely doesn’t mix well with makeup and other skincare products and pills off if you rub it in. It also smells… well like sunscreen. It does the job but leaves you very greasy looking. Good for the price though
it's not sticky
I like this because it doesn’t have an overwhelming SPF odor and also isn’t oily. It doesn’t make the face look shiny. It also feels light. You won’t even feel like you have sunblock on. Will buy again.
I’ve used this sunscreen consistently for a long time and while it does do a great job of protecting your skin from the sun, I find that it doesn’t layer on itself super well upon reapplication. This may be because of other products I’m using, but on me it tends to pill up. When I wear makeup I experience the same thing as well. I also find that sometimes it leaves a white cast, even when using the proper amount. It does not do much for hydration in my opinion, but doesn’t dry out my skin either.It is still a very good and cheap sunscreen however, so I still recommend buying it. :) All skin is different.
Gives off a white cast and felt like my skin was burning the first time I use it but didn’t throw it away and kept using it, didn’t felt the burning again, maybe because I didn’t shake it the first time? Anyways, won’t buy again.
The last thing this aging mid-life crisis 39 yr old male wants to do is find a product to protect his face during record Arizona temps. But 2020 has been a year of self-reflection and even though I'm subtly breaking out in tiny pimps from wearing a mask, this 30 SPF hasn't brought back memories from college when half of us shy narcissists looked like crater face from saved by the bell.Seriously tho:Very light when applied while white haze turns invincible within minutes.Does not leave the face unruly shiny w/ spf30.Works well with their 2.5% benz.Most recommended for the sensitive skin prone to breakouts who want to stay young without future botox.
It’s great. Just what I was looking for.
Works great to prevent the darkening of the skin around the mouth and forehead. Highly recommend
Good spread and feel
I have been using this exact sunblock for years on my face and neck. Opened the one I bought on Amazon (first time doing that) and it smelled different but I used it last weekend and today and my skin was not protected at all. There is either something new about this formula or this isn’t really neutrogena. Either way I don’t feel this product that I received is helping protect my skin. Two stars because it didn’t make my skin breakout.
Can only find on Amazon. Not sure if this one has changed in stores but this sun screen does not leave a whitish tone to skin or cause breakouts. The ones found in stores, not sure if ingredients changed but I do not like.
It goes on so easy and really makes my face feel soft and not oily or shinny. Doesn't give my face a white tint like some sun screen do. As far as sun protection...it needs to be reapplied often to really be effective. Over all I would recommend this product.
I love this sunscreen, helped my breakouts and my skin has been feeling smooth, and not oily at all. I have combo skin, so this is both moisturizing and not oily! I like to spread it around my face, wait 30 seconds and then blend it in. Leaves no white cast after you wait 30 seconds!!! I RECOMMEND AFTER TRYING SO MANY SUNSCREENS
This is a great sunscreen. it has a matte finish but not drying, it spreads easily and absorbs rapidly, and it does not pill. However, it stings so badly especially around the eyes.
Seems like a great value for the money. A bit watery when squeezed out, but immediately thickens up when you start to rub it in. Small tint of white until you fully rub it in and then no issues. Seems to be working well for me and doesn't cause any oiliness under my makeup. Dries well and doesn't sit on top of your skin, but without drying it out. I like it better than my Murad sunscreen from Sephora.
My teenage son has been working outside all summer and must wear sunblock every day. Other brand and types of sunscreen he has used on his age have left him great and breaking out more due to sweat mixing with he product on his fa e. Since switching to this, his skin has calmed down dramatically . I recommended this to a friend for her tenager to try because it is that great!
• hard to spread, trying to rub in makes face red and irritated• also, looks greasy afterwardsOverall, not insanely terrible but would definitely not buy again or recommend
I have been using this product for 4 days now. I’d like to say I finally have a face sunscreen that doesn’t clog my pores! AND it’s moisturizing. I do not use it close to my eyes as I’ve always used Pond’s around my eyes. I have never found a face moisturizer that doesn’t clog my pores (Pond’s included) and now I have found something with SPF 55 AND moisturizing. I’ve used it everyday and will continue to use it as my sunscreen and moisturizer. I personally don’t think it smells like anything let alone sunscreen. It doesn’t leave a white residue. It leaves my skin looking matte and not oily.
I need to use a sunscreen with a slightly higher SPF for my hyperpigmentation. I feel good about using Neutrogena product, and started using this sunscreen over a year ago. I have oily skin, and other sunscreens have caused me to break out. This one has not. I can’t say that it has prevented further sunspots, but it has not made the existing ones ny worse, so I will take that. I do think that it is a little greasy when applying, and it tends to make my makeup wear off soon. Overall, I continue to use it because it does not make my skin worse, and the price is good. This is actually a few dollars cheaper here than at Target.
A safe sunscreen don't clog my pore and break me out. It is more liquid compare to other neutrogena sunscreen. I bought the spf 30 instead of spf 55 because this spf 30 won't sting my eyes. I have combination skin and always layer sunscreen on the top of moisturizer. This one works great as a daliy life sunscreen. By the way, I am an outsider worker that means most of my time was spend inside hourse or office. In this way, spf 30 is just enough for my skin protection from the sun coming through the window. If you are outsider worker, spf 55 is cleary a better choice.
Not sticky, has a slight sunscreen smell. It does sting a bit when I first put it on. I just tell myself that 'that means it's working" 😆 Maybe all sunscreens burn a bit...this is the first time I've actually used sunscreen. So.... I don't really know. 🤷🏽‍♀️
As a person of colour, I appreciate a product that did not leave a heavy, greasy white residue, as with other brands. This worked great with my Revlon foundation too.
I just put this on my face for the first time, so I'll update as I learn more but so far I can say I'm really impressed with the lack of greasiness. A minute or two after applying my face feels completely dry and normal. A+Update: Okay, I've used it at least a dozen times now and I can verify that it hasn't caused any acne. I did notice a drying effect on my skin. It started peeling everywhere but nothing a little exfoliating in the shower can't fix. I already had dry skin to begin with and I read this type of product does tend to dry you out a bit. If you have normal or oily skin I'd imagine you won't have this problem. I really like this stuff and am about to buy more. The only way it could be better is if they found a way to make it odorless.
I just discovered this last year and have been using it during the summer months.  Hands down this has been the best sunscreen I have found for my face and I have tried many from European to Asian sunscreens.  If you need moisturizing, this is not for you.I have combination skin with very oily T zone. This just disappears without any residue. It feels like I have nothing on.  Does not sting my skin or eyes. All the other neutrogena spf burned my skin briefly and stung my eyes until I couldn’t wait to wash off so I was very pleasantly surprised by this.It has the same ingredients as much more expensive anthelios melt in spf 60 sunscreen which came up best in consumer reports for sunscreen. This one has less Homosalate.I noticed that this is under $6 and on clearance on target. I hope it’s not being discontinued.
I love this product the only downside is it goes on white and is alittle tacky, you can layer makeup on it but powder is more likely to separate, it helps with sweat acne though which is exactly why I got it and is confirmed to be great for sensitive skin
I've got nothing but raves for this product and the expectations are always consistent it cleans well very light and moisturizing didn't feel like it was damaging my skin while cleaning
Love this product. I very rarely rebuy something (they're so many products to try) but this one I got a second time. Doesn't leave me too greasy (I have oily skin) and it works well under my makeup and on it's own. I apply in the morning and it's good enough for the entire day.Now it isn't something that I would wear if I'm in direct sunlight for an extended period (at the beach etc) but for everyday protection this is great. Would recommend!
I have tried all kinds of sunscreens on my bald head and most always ended up with a greasy head that broke out that night. I actually gave up for awhile then found this. It goes on easily - protects darn well and produces ZERO problems.  NO GREASE - no breakouts - no pimples - ... Just clean smooth protected skin.
This product soaks in very quickly, and protects skin adequately. I found it to be slightly irritating upon application because I have sensitive skin, and I couldn’t bring it too close to my eyes due to stinging. I used it with no issues though for 3 months when I was unable to get my HG ROHTO sunscreen due to COVID and the issues with air travel from other countries. Overall I would certainly repurchase, the price is right, but I would use it for my neck and upper body.
Used this for a week now under my makeup and wearing a mask for hours at work and NO BREAKOUTS!! This is light and the matte finish does not make your face look like an oil slick by 10 am. I am only using one oil absorbing wipe per day now. I highly recommend this sunscreen.However, don't use this for the back of your hands. This is for your face only and the bottle clearly states clear face.
Protects from the sun and is easy to spread/absorb into skin. Has a bit of an old man smell, however. And if it gets in my mouth it makes my tongue go numb.
This sunscreen does its job. It just burns.I went through a week long elimination cycle with all of the products I use, because I do use both a chemical and physical exfoliant with isotretinoin which also causes burning. After winnowing down my routine to only a light, non-exfoliating face wash and this sunsceeen, I've found immediate burning after placing this sunscreen over my T-zone (it's weirdly fine over the cheeks and neck). I've also been breaking out twice as much as normal during the two weeks I've been using this sunscreen around the mouth where the burning is most intense, but I haven't seen any generalized redness. I think that's the extra irritation of having to talk through a mask all day.The product is very thick and oily, but it doesn't spread great which meant I was applying a thicker layer to get full coverage. When applied so thickly, the sunscreen does leave a white cast. It doesn't leave a cast if you really rub it in, but I was unable keep willing myself to do so because of the aforementioned burning sensation.Oxybenzone (the active ingredient) does that to many people. I bought this to help with lightening my acne scars and it has certainly done that, but I'm going to have to switch to a different type of chemical sunscreen in the future. It's too bad, because the price really is great, but I can't do this burning and stinging everyday.
I live by the ocean even on the cloudiest days I need sunscreen on my face.
Really good sunscreen, spreads easily. At the beginning it goes on white but dries clear. It is not oily on the skin. Only issue is that it pills and balls depending on what you have underneath. I can’t apply my The Ordinary Niaciamide Serum, Vitamin C serum from Olehenriksen or Salicylic acid serum because it will pill. However, when I apply it after the Hydroboost moisturizer, it goes on perfectly. It is all a trial and error. I have test it in UV index 8+ at the beach, and it has kept me from burning. I highly recommend, specially if your skin care in the morning is simple.
The search for non-greasy sunscreen for my face is over.  This one goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy film.  It completely disappears after being rubbed in, no more rubbing my face raw to get the white coat of sunscreen to rub in.  I use this as my daily sunscreen under makeup for everyday use.  Both my daughter and I have not had any breakouts or skin irritation from its use.  I have extremely sensitive skin so this was a concern for me. My daughter and I both have very pale sensitive skin that freckles and burns easy.  Living in Florida means we have to be very vigilant with sunscreen use to avoid looking like the alligators we share space with.  I typically put it only one once during the day for normal use.  I reapply every 2 hours if it is a beach or pool day.  If I follow those guidelines I have not had any sunburns on areas of use.  I use this only for face, neck, and ears and use spray on sunscreen for the rest of the body.
*****UPDATE*******after couple of time using it causes break-out with white heads which I never hadI thing it clogged my poresNever use it againThis sunscreen cream is a miracle , I wasn't sure if I want to give it a try ,because I have Combination skin (  dry and oily at the same time) and I had bad experience of having breakouts with other sunscreen creams ,but I was ran out of sunscreen cream ( I was using HYSEKE Solair SPF50 ) and it wasn't in the market here in US so I had to choose between tons of sunscreen creams , first I read almost all the reviews of so many products and then decided to go with Clear face Neutrogena because It had mentioned that it is anti breakout and also it had good price ,at first when I apply it I was afraid of burning eyes which a lot of reviewers had mentioned BUT for me noting happened no burning eyes and no irritation actually I apply this cream on my eye lead also and no burn has happened yet ,It has good and long lasting protection and also feels very smooth and not greasy on my skin which is a Big positive point!  and also there was no white residue on my skin after applying the creamI recommend this sunscreen cream because of  5 reason :1. NO white residue at all + It stays longer and has a perfect protection2.No eye burning ( at least for me ! , you may give it a try just like me )3.NO breakouts and pimple disasters after applying it4.very good price for the value5.smooth and non greasy feeling after applying It was all my personal experience with this cream, I hope this review will help you to choose the right cream for your skin .
I looove this. I am a pilot and needed good protection. I also have oily skin and this works great. Definitely recommend
Clear, leaves no white cast on skin it’s dry too, I have a dry skin and I feel I need to put on moisturizer before it , it would be perfect with someone with an oily skin
At nearly 40 years old I'm starting to see a lot of sun damage on my face, I'm suddenly noticing dark spots and the fine lines are getting less fine so I'm more concerned than I've ever been about protecting my face from the near constant CA sun.  I don't wear make up alot and am super concious about any products that make my skin look like there is anything ON my skin (oily, shiny, etc).  I just got this the other day and yesterday was the first day I wore it but I loved it, as soon as it absorbed in I forgot I had put it on, I could touch my face and it felt (and it looked) normal.  I highly recommend this sunblock and I'll be ordering it again too!
I bought this sunscreen with the intention of wearing it everyday as part of my skin care routine, under makeup. The best thing I can say about this sunscreen is that it does actually provide some protection. The other positive thing I can say about it is that in the three days that I wore it, it did not make me break out. But there are some negatives that come along with it! First off, it does leave a white cast, and I am quite pale to begin with. It tends to break up as it wears, with white chunky pieces peeling off your face. My biggest issue with the sunscreen is that it burns your eyes! As the day wears on, your face gets oily, and things start to move around. If you want to spend half the day with your eyes burning, this is the sunscreen for you!
Looking for a daily sunscreen to go with my eight step Korean beauty regimen… Decided to try this one after reading all of the four star reviews. I tried it for the first time yesterday and it was easy to apply to my face over my other products however I still needed to moisturize on top of the sunscreen which I’m not sure is such a good idea and I carried that uncomfortable tight sunscreen feel and smell with me for the rest of the day. After a few hours I had to wash my face and get the sunscreen off. Not sure if this is going to work for my day to day and maybe I will just use on my vacation however I ordered a couple different types to try them all and compare Overall this is not a bad sunscreen at all - but definitely not the most comfortable that I’ve tried and i’m guessing that with most of facial sunscreen products I’m not going to be able to get away from that slight hint of sunscreen smell that doesn’t seem to go away for a couple hours
As a person of color, it hard to find a sunscreen, let alone moisturizer with a decent amount of SPF, that doesn't leave me looking ashy or oily afterwards. I love this product because it's not too thick, so I don't mind wearing makeup on top of it and it's doesn't leave you looking ashy no matter how much you apply so I don't mind wearing it by itself. I love and definitely will be purchasing more.
This stings my face when I put on my face.  A slight sting, but still.  I was using Elta MD Clear before and that never felt like anything when I put it on my face.  I wonder if it is because I now out Salicylic acid on my face at night.  Elta MD is $35.  So now I am buying the Neutrogena  Sensitve SPF60, all mineral based, will see if that stings my face.I will use this up putting on my neck, but not my face.  Cheap sunscreen, also love fragrance free.
I use this as an everyday sunscreen for skincare. It doesn't seem to make me break out or cause lots of oil. I have not used it in a full day of sun so I cannot attest to it protecting for hours but when I spend a little bit of time outside everyday I am glad I wear sunscreen on my face. It is a good price for the product. Hope this helps somebody!
I live in CA and it's always so sunny but i absolutely hate sunscreen and the feeling it leaves / rubbing it in so it's not white, etc... this was great for me and brother both. we both have acne prone skin, he's on acutane so very sensitive as well. I'm on a retinol cream so also needed something that wouldn't sting. very easy to rub in, seems more like a lightweight facial lotion than sunscreen. i actually use it all the time now. i wear it under and over makeup
I have combination skin. Use Olay SPF 30 oil free face lotion in the winter but need SPF 50+ for the summer. Olay doesn't have oil-free face lotion with SPF 50+.  I'm glad I found this Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen for Acne-Prone Skin.  It spreads easily, does not leave any oily residue on my face, and does not cause any reaction to my sensitive skin.  I have not been out in the sun much since receiving this face lotion a few days ago.  May update more later.
I have used this for the past four months and it is a great face sunblock overall.  I have combination skin (oily T-zone and dry cheeks).  This sunblock is great for people starting out with skincare as it is a good for its price.  I will definitely continue to use it and finish the bottle.  Although the only downfall I may notice for others is it does leave a bit of a white cast, but since I’m really pale it is not too much of a problem for me.  I will probably dry other sunblocks before considering this a staple in my routine, but it is definitely a contender.
This product was pretty thick but overall it did the job of moisturizing the face. It was pretty hard to spread on the face and I if you have a dry face that makes it even harder but overall it’s a good product that’s worth the money I paid for!!
I am into skin care and we all know the number 1 rule of protecting your skin, SPF!!! This sunscreen is super easy to apply. The best part about this sunscreen is that it doesn’t take 3 minutes to fully rub in, and it will fully rub in without any white residue or any white tint! I will definitely buy this again when I run out.
Leaves a little white cast. Not as bad as others, but still noticeable. Good sun protection though.
This sunscreen did what it says it'll do: it protected my face from the sun and didn't break me out. That being said, I don't know if it's holy grail status. It's easy to rub in (no white cast), feels very light on the skin, and dries to a surprisingly matte finish. It might be too matte for those with dry skin. It doesn't have any added fragrance and a little goes a long way, meaning the bottle will likely last a while.My issues with it is that some of the ingredients are a little suspect. Not crazy about the chemical suncreens (oxybenzone, homosalate, etc.) used, as well as a few ingredients that are possibly mildly comedogenic. It's also packed full of silicones, about which there's a lot of conflicting information when it comes to acne. I just use a good cleanser every night to make sure I'm not leaving any buildup on my skin that could be a problem down the road.
I absolutely love this! I put it on and I don’t feel like wearing a mask. I don’t feel clogged pores! 100% anti breakouts on the face! Actually you can put it on a thousand times per day and you are gonna feel your face free from heavy substances!
I've been on the hunt for a face sunscreen that doesn't break me out and doesn't make me look really oily. This sunscreen is great, it make my face dewy but not gross looking like others I have tried. It does have a slight white cast that doesn't really bother me very much and its definitely not as bad as some other brands I've tried.
Nothing to complain about. Soaks in pretty nicely.
This product runs and streaks if you get hot or sweaty outside; not for the beach or outside in the heat. Maybe I failed to read something about not using as an outside summer sunscreen product.... but It also caused my face to break out - including under my eyes - which is totally unusual.... maybe ok if you want sunscreen for everyday use as a makeup product  (?) just don’t get hot or sweaty
I have sensitive skin. I broke out with several zits after using another sunscreen. I rarely breakout with several zits now that I am 37.  Now I only use this on my face and haven't had anymore breakouts. It has a faint smell to me. Not great but not bad. It applies smoothly and dries quickly. Great coverage. I will be buying more when my tube runs out although I do expect it to last all summer and we go swimming 4-5 days per week.
I love this Sunscreen. It’s also a great moisturizer. I have been using it for a while now and I have to say that my breakouts have went away. I can go a month without any breakouts.
No heavy. Easy to spread across the face and neck
I am extremely oily… this product does not contribute this problem and may even be helping? My skin loves it. I am usually sensitive to sunscreen and other cosmetics, this has not made my face itch, tingle or burn.  I love it.
I have very sensitive skin, I’m outdoors a lot in the summer so I always breakout from any type of facial sunscreens. I have been using this for a few weeks and haven’t had any breakouts. It’s also a good finish, it doesn't feel greasy or heavy on the skin even after being outdoors/sweating.
So far the best sunscreen ever!! Very light, you feel like you aren't using it. Very quick to dry and the skin feels very soft. I had many sunscreens before this that supose to be "matte" but once you sweat the skin turns really shiny, this one is incredible, even if you are sweating a lot, your face is still mate and very smooth.
As a bald guy I purchased this sunscreen to apply to my scalp.  In the past I had issues with sunscreen causing me to breakout after using it.  So I researched and found this one should not cause that problem.  And after several uses now I can confirm I have had no issues.  It applies easily and doe not leave my head feeling greasy/sticky etc.  This is now my go to sunscreen for my head and face.
It irritates my skin if I use too much, but that's easily reversed by using it sparingly! And I've seriously never gotten burnt wearing it. Not even during a 100-degree+ Fahrenheit Italian summer. I wouldn't say it's terribly moisturizing, but it doesn't dry my skin out, either. And it doesn't make me break out. Overall, sun protection is the main thing here, and for that I recommend it 100%.
This is a great sunscreen for sensitive skin. I've been using it for a while and I don't get breakouts. It's not oily, which means it's going to be a little drying, but I put a little bit of regular moisturizer on top and it does the trick. *beware* I have tan brown skin and it does leave a white residue on your face. If you leave it on for 5 minutes, it'll blend into your skin, but I usually wear makeup on top, so it's completely fine.
great! I loved, when it's be over I'll definellu buy it again
While I love the high spf protection that this product offers, and its non comedogenic properties, it feels very greasy when you apply. If you have oily skin, I wouldn't recommend. The other thing that I don't like about it is that I have a really hard time working out with this on my face. I cycle a lot which means that I am in the sun and I need a high spf protection. But when I sweat with this on my face it gets into my eyes and burns. Not ideal when you are trying to cycle and get a good workout in. I'm going to use the rest of the product because it does work and you can put some setting powder on your face after application to get rid of the how oily it can be, but I don't want to repurchase.
Not cruelty free
Its honestly just sunscreen nothing really to special
I have ridiculously awful skin, in that everything I apply to my face tends to break me out. Lotions, makeup, sunscreens, etc. I bought this, sure that it would break me out, but desperate to protect my face from the sun (I decided acne and possible acne scars would be better than skin cancer)Well after over a year of use, I can confidently say that it definitely doesn't make my acne any worse! And that is a huge plus for me!I usually just apply it once in the morning and I'm good to go for the day. I'll reapply if I am spending more time in the sun, or if I happen to get wet or sweatyIt goes on smooth. It only feels a little greasy at first, but my combination skin is quick to absorb it. Just make sure you run the product in all the way as it is white until you rub enough!
The product is very good feeling for my acne oily sweat skin. It keep smooth surface after apply few minutes. I bought the 4 times this products. However if your skin is peeling by acne treatment product. You should apply moiturizer before use this suncream.
Feels good on the skin but it burns my eyes. Don't put near eyes. Burns like hell.
I’m not oily or breakout prone at all. My face is usually quite clear. Once I introduced this sunscreen, my face was slick and greasy all the time even after cleansing and I started developing blackheads, cysts, and nodules. I stopped using it and my skin returned to normal. I have not had this issue with any other sunscreen or facial product.Clear face my butt. This sunscreen got RID of my clear face.2 stars just because the sun protection is good.
I love this sunscreen. It has such a nice finish and feels really good on my skin. I have very oily skin so the fact that I can put multiple layers of this on and not feel greasy or clogged is awesome. I don't notice a white cast either. Will definitely buy again!
Sunscreen ALWAYS makes my face feel oily, sticky and uncomfortable. Even without sunscreen, my face is so oily that by 2pm I have to use oil-absorbing sheets. This product completely changed that. Not only does it provide excellent sun protection, it also helps control my oil levels ALL day long! Absolutely no skin irritation or breakouts from this product. I did a ton of research on the best sunscreens for oily skin and chose this one. I am so glad I did!
I bought for my daughter, who struggles with break outs and this is the best product I’ve found. Doesn’t aggravate it. It is not greasy. It is very light and does not have a strong fragrance. Recommend
I live in Sunny South Florida, I rely on sunscreen as a daily product. Recently I needed to find a new facial sunscreen as the one I'd been using is no longer sold. I ordered this and I did my normal face routine then added the sunscreen like normal. Before I could do my makeup and leave the house, it started to flake off, left a horrible white cast on my face. I had to rewash my face and forgo sunscreen till I could purchase something else. Also, after just the one use and it being on less than an hour, my face broke out. Do not waste your money on this. Don't know if it even protects against the sun as I didn't make it out of the house.
This is a decent sunscreen. Doesn’t leave a white film after drying down and doesn’t cause any acne breakouts which I’m thankful for. I’m prone to contact dermatitis from sunscreens and this also didn’t give me any of that. However, the sunscreen didn’t work that well under makeup, causing my face to look/feel dry. It’s still a good sunscreen, so I will be keeping it.
I don’t think this would be helpful for women with that incredible, deep brown skin, I’m a bit lighter (iced coffee??) and it doesn’t leave a white cast. I recommend putting it on either before or after regular face lotion so it can blend in with that layer a bit without leaving a white cast on darker women.
At first try I thought this sunscreen is it. It doesn’t make me shine as much and it’s not as greasy as the many ones I’ve tried before. But after a week of using this, I noticed small bumps and breakouts across my T-zones if I have it on for the whole day, which I found can be fixed with thorough double cleansing, tea tree oil, and face scrubs. Overall, this sunscreen is satisfactory and I think I’ll keep using it until I find the perfect one for my oily skin.
I r e a l l y wanted to like this. I'm African American and have acne-prone skin so I'm picky with daily sunscreen. I will say this DOESN'T really leave a white cast; at first if you put it on generously, it almost has a primer effect. I actually really like how it looks. The ever so slight paleness eventually melts away. However, i have two MAJOR problems with this:1) it makes me SUPER oily. Like i can feel it on my face. Kinda makes me self conscious at work cuz i just know i look like a lightbulb2) i break out like CRAZY. At first i thought it was coincidental but when i really paid attention, I'd suddenly have 12 bumps on my face that were practically gone the next day if i promptly washed it off. It says noncomedogenic but I don't really believe it. I wish i could.Plus when it makes my face crazy oily it gets in my eyes and burns like mad.A lot of people like it but it's not universally perfect.
I like that this sunscreen spreads easily and doesn't leave white marks or streaks on my face. and the most important thing is that it really is/feels oil free. After I apply it all over my face and neck, my skin feel dry (not the bad kind of dry) in less than a minute and i can apply my makeup, even powdered blush, without worrying it will be smudgy like with other sunscreens.
Nice product, but dries my skin a bit. I apply it with a moisturizer, so it’s okay.Very blendable, doesn’t leave white spots on the skin. Also doesn’t break out my skin, which is great.
A lot of face sunblocks are a little oily and it gets into my eyes when I sweat. This goes on smooth, smells fine, and works really well.
Great option for folks of color. I’m brown skinned and it Does NOT leave a white cast. It does sting the eyes a bit if you’re sweating, crying, or if you rub your eyes. Works great under makeup and does not leave a flashback.
This sunscreen is amazing! I wanted to start wearing sunscreen daily and this has been perfect! It does not cause any break outs, nor is it oily. It applies perfect after moisturizer and goes well under makeup.
I have acne prone skin and this product keeps my skin moisturized and protected throughout the day! Great product!
i have suffered from cystic acne +breakouts+ blackheads+whiteheads along with mild hyperpigmentation for almost like 7 yrs. Before using this sunscreen, all the other sunscreen were kinda trash.When i was in tetrinoin treatment, it helped me alot preventing the hyperpigmentation. Now my acne has reduced to half without any hyperpigmentation.It doesnt feel like chappy or greasy but makes my skin glow. This sunscreen is a life saver
I wear this every day. I was really worried that it would make me break out, since I have a lot of acne issues anyway and pretty sensitive skin, but it didn't at all. It's like a very light moisturizer, so you still need to put on a moisturizer over it, but it's very effective.It's also the cheapest acne free face sunscreen I could find on Amazon and that's a major plus. I've been using it for months now and still have about half left, but I do only use it on my face.I have accidentally gotten it in my mouth and it tastes very bad, but I think all sunscreen will do that.
Really love this sunscreen. Easy to apply and doesn’t leave a white caste at all. Also it doesn’t have a strong scent like most sunscreens do, and absorbs nicely. I have sensitive skin as well and this does not make me break out.
This product is a little on the watery side, so you want to be careful when squeezing the tube.  It seems to work well, but needs to be applied multiple times a day if you’re out in the sun a lot.  Didn’t leave my face feeling greasy.
another product that is supposed to be for sensative skin and burns the crap out of my face. When you are supposed to apply sunscreen every two hours don't care to go through that torture. I returned the product as it is not good fo my skin. I did give a 4 star rating because if it didn't burn my skin it is a very nice product. I ended up replacing with a mineral baby sunscreen.
I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen is the only one I can use on my face that protects my fair skin and does not cause breakouts.
It is gentle and light and does not make my face break out. However, it leaves some tiny white residue all over my skin after I apply it, which is why I’m not giving it five stars
Great sunscreen for my face, which tends to be on the oily side.  In the past it has been difficult for me to find sunscreens that will work well for my face without being oily, nor leaving whiteness (as is the case with zinc oxide).  I was very pleased to see that this sunscreen, however, worked perfectly for me.  It is not greasy in any manner whatsoever, and rubs in beautifully with no remaining whiteness.  While using this, my face has not become red in the least bit.  I will have to use this for a longer period of time, however, to confirm that for sure.  Finally, I really like how this is unscented, as using scented sunscreen for my face would be too overpowering.
I love this sunscreen for my face. I struggle to find something that doesnt feel greasy, doesnt clog my pores, AND has good coverage. This did it for me. I'll continue using this from here on out.
I have pretty sensitive skin. I burn easily, I break out easily, & I have rosacea. This facial sunscreen feels silky soft on my skin, non greasy!!, offers great sun protection, & didn't cause a breakout.
Doesn’t leave you feeling greasy at all!
I apply this before I put my makeup on every morning on a damp face and this tiny bottle will literally last me all year haha. Not oily at all, not shiny and doesn’t make my face feel cakey or heavy with my moisturizer and foundation 😊
good sunscreen , i mix it wit my cerave moisturizer!
I used to use Neutrogena Dry-Touch SPF 55 and I thought I was satisfied. Then I tried this stuff. I'm never going back! This formula truly is not at all greasy - it melts into my skin and dries completely. It doesn't even smell like sunscreen! I've definitely noticed an improvement in my skin after switching to this sunscreen. Buy it!!
Great not greasy easy to spread. Skin feels cooler in the hot sun.
Applies easily, doesn't make me break out. I really like that it has no scent.
THIS SERIOUSLY BURNED MY SKIN. AND TOOK A LONG TIME TO RUB IN. NEVER AGAIN.
I was kind of weary about this spf looking at the reviews, but I LOVE IT !! My skin is oily so this sunscreen keeps it matte all day, protects my face, doesn’t get greasy or leave a white cast, and does not break me out at all
For anyone worried about a white cast - there is one but in my experience it does fade after a little while. This has helped me fade my acne scars and protect me from sunburn/damage. It’s also WAY cheaper in stores or on the Ulta app so that’s a perk
I used this sunscreen for the past 4 months, and I thought that it was really good for my oily skin because it dries matte and is not oily at all! However, it stings and burns like crazy. I felt like Kevin in Home Alone...  It also left my skin reddish, so this sunscreen might not well suited for sensitive skin.Pros:- matte- non oily- cost friendlyCons:- burns- stings eyes when washing face- might be drying for dry skin- possibly sensitizing
I honestly love this ! I’m really into facial sunscreens right now and was looking for something inexpensive.  Right out the tube it’s white but spreads easily into your skin without a purple/gray cast other facial sunscreens leave behind. It does have a mild sunscreen scent, but I dint mind it , I like it . It also does not make my face oily & works well with my skin. Definitely recommend !
I have medium to dry skin type. This is too dry for me. It becomes powerderish within one hour after applied to the skin. And it irritates eyes!!! I can bearly open my eyes when accidentally applied somewhere near eye circles.
After I used up this bottle, I switched to a mineral sunscreen. Nothing against this product in particular- more against chemical sunscreens in general, they really irritate my eyes. Furthermore, chemical sunscreens require diligent reapplication throughout the day that, quite frankly, I don't have the energy or time or money for.My personal preferences aside, this sunscreen is pretty great! It dries quickly, but does dry slightly oilier than the mineral sunscreen that I have since started using. It does well under makeup, but can see this product being more ideal for someone looking for a quick application with no further fuss with appearance.
I did a long search for a good sunscreen for my face, and finally found one that wasn't greasy and stayed on even after a couple trips into the water... it spreads really easily and it doesn't feel like icing on your face...I would totally recommend it if you have fair skin, there was no redness or skin irritation at the end of the day!
I hate putting on regular sunscreen on my face. It makes my face feel greasy and I worry about breakouts caused by it. My previous face sunscreen was SPF 70. I think that is too high and prevents any tanning. The SPF 30 is much more reasonable, but I still think it prevents tanning. Ideally I'd like to have SPF 15 but I don't think they make that for oil-free face sunscreen.This sun screen is a bit more runny then I've seen before. It wasn't an issue, but I wasn't expecting that. I love bringing this stuff on any vacation, or any days where I will be outside for a prolonged period of time. After application, it dries quickly and feels good on my face. No greasy or oily feeling.Pros:Easy to applyDries quicklyCons:Doesn't allow for maximum tanning
It instantly dries, it’s great
I really wanted to love this sunscreen, but it is just too drying for my skin. I've been using it for a couple weeks and it has been giving me dry patches on my cheeks and forehead, even though I apply it OVER a moisturizer. I think it could be great during the summer when my skin is more oily (I have combination skin that skews a little dryer in the winter). I will try it again once the weather warms up, but for now, I need to find a more moisturizing sunscreen.
Always forgot to apply at home glad I found for golf days
I was a little hesitant about trying this product but I am glad I did. Not only does it protect my skin but it doesn't make me break out at all! Is so light and not sticky. Definitely a 5 star. Give it a try!

I buy one every summer.  Neutrogena products work well for me.  Other sunscreens will clog my pores and cause breakouts.  So I have this for face, and whatever other sunscreen for body.  Container seems small but it's enough to get through the summer if you use it just on the face, so it's worth it.
My all time favorite sunblock for my face!! I only use on my face, ears & neck. It’s not as greasy feeling as other ones. As with any sunblock reapply after hours in sun/water.
Clear Face is the answer to my quest for a higher SPF facial sunscreen that doesn't liquify my makeup & leave me looking shiny within an hour.  It applies smoothly, blends into skin easily & provides a moist but almost matte finish for applying make up.  For the past year I'd been using Neutrogena's Ultra Sheer SPF 70 which was less greasy than Olay Regenerist Broad Spectrum SPF 50 which I'd used for several years, but Clear Face is a much more satisfactory product.  I'm in my 60's but still have an oily T-zone.  I do blot my face with a tissue after applying a nickel-sized amount to my face & neck before applying my foundation & powder.  I am hoping that it will provide sufficient moisture protection during the frigid winter months.  In the meantime, it has been a godsend for summer weather!
I love using it everyday
Great for oily skin, almost provides a matte affect. Works well with the rest of my skincare routine and lightweight enough to be forgotten about. Would recommend to others with oily skin trying to add a little defense to their routine on a budget.
I have mild melasma (darker pigmented areas) on my face.  Being out in the sun without protection makes the melasma spots become darker.  I've been using this sunscreen daily for six months and it has made such a difference!  Even without make up on, my spots are barely visible.  I'm not saying that wearing this sunscreen will rid you of melasma.  But, protecting your skin from the sun will make the darker pigmentation fade dramatically.  I wear this sunscreen under my make up and it is not greasy at all.  I can be outside for hours and this sunscreen does an amazing job of protecting my skin.
I love this sunscreen! My face breaks out easily with products but this sunscreen has never once burned, irritated, or broken out my skin!! I’m so happy I found it. I use it every day on my face and on my tattoo because I work out in the sun. This sunscreen is very minimally greasy and lasts for hours, even in the water!
I recently started a new skin regimen with Curology and they suggested this as my sun screen. I’ve dealt with cystic acne for the last 4 years and struggled to find anything to put on my face that did not irritate and further inflame my skin.This did not break me out or irritate my skin in any way. The formula is a bit greasy but it does not sit on top of my face for long. My skin stays moisturized all day.  I’m so glad I found this product that I can use daily.
It works to protect you from the sun, however it smells so strongly of gasoline.
Works great. I was skeptical but it honestly hasn’t made my face neck or back breakout while using it. My acne isn’t horrible but putting certain lotions on my face definitely trigger breakouts but I haven’t had any while using this sunscreen. I also tend to wash it off the moment I head indoors. It’s light on the skin and easy to apply.
I love this sunscreen already! Its lightweight and leaves a soft satin finish on your skin (not greasy at all). As someone with acne prone skin, I don’t feel like this could break me out at all. I love using it :)
Finally found sunscreen that doesn't make me break out! Would definitely recommend for acne prone skin. Not thick and sticky. Also, it doesn't make my face look super greasy like most sunscreens do.
It is nice overall-- easy to use, protects skin etc. but every time I put it on, it tingles my skin and it is making me worried if this product is going to start causing breakouts/acne. Also I use it after a moisturizer but it still makes my skin a bit dry/gives a matte feel.
After about 20 years of research this must be the only sunscreen that doesn’t break me out.I reapply it during the day and it just absorb quickly and doesn’t leave a white cast and it doesn’t smell
I have oily face with acne was so hard to find a sunscreen to match my face, when I try this one it worked great without any breakouts or white color on the face. Good price too! 🌷
I purchased this due to the high SPF, specific to face sunscreen, and low price. If I were to buy this same product in stores it would be around double the price. I use this every morning before I got to work as a field biologist. It does not leave a white residue or seem to cause any break outs. I breakout normally caused by being a young woman but can’t notice any more by using this product. Wish they had more natural products but I guess ya get what you pay for and protection from the sun is more important!
I have tried several sunscreens that claimed to offer "matte" protection, and this is by far the one that worked best for me.  While the others inevitably led to an oily, shiny face almost immediately, this one added little or no shine, and was a nicely smooth and slightly thin formula that was easy to apply thoroughly but lightly.
I like this sunscreen, is for my daily use, and I thing that have excellent  price. Only I never use it when I'm going to put on makeup because my skin feels a little greasy
This is great! It goes on light, very breathable on your skin, but does the job of protecting it! I have sensitive skin and it didn’t bother it at all!
Caveat: I do NOT spend my life out in the sun. So, if you don't either then this sunscreen is perfect. It gives reasonable SPF but the headline is how gorgeously it goes on. It's so light it literally melts into your skin and only leaves a beautiful soft feeling. ZERO grease. ZERO "sunscreen sweat" when you're out in the sun.  It really is a no greasy feel lotion you don't often find in a sun screen. My husband has acne and has to be careful of sunscreen. He loves this one and has had NO breakouts using it. We will definitely buy this again.
I have a sunroof in my car and I live in the south so its often uncovered. I put this on my head and faces and it gives me great protection. Never burned. KInda white-ish until it is absorbed but that lets you know where it is and if you missed in spots in the application.
I have oily skin that is dry from indoor cooling and heating now that we're sheltering-in-place. I wanted some sunscreen that didn't have titanium oxide and zinc oxide, which leave my skin feeling slimy.This is definitely less slimy. But it's super drying, which just results in skin feeling tight and producing more oily. So I can't recommend it for skin than is anything other than acne-prone. Still searching for a light, non-slimy feeling sunscreen for combination skin.
My wife and I have enjoyed using this product. It works as advertised - protecting from the sun and not leaving a greasy look or feel. Would buy again!PROS:Feels greatProtects from sumLooks good (no greasy skin)Has minimal smell/odor compared to other sunscreensprice is decentCONS:None?We love the product and would recommend.
This product is pretty good considering the price. However, if you have rosacea or sensitive skin it did leave my face a little red after.
This made my face very dry ata the beginning but I think my skin got used to it after few days. Make sure you read the review before you get it
So this sunscreen is moisturizing and all of that but I felt it caused pimples on my face and the whole reason why I bought it was so it wouldn’t cause acne. Hence the 3 stars, otherwise it’s good
I read that dermatologists recommend using a sunscreen separate from a daily moisturizer because the latter is less effective. I was having a hard time finding a sunscreen that didn't feel greasy on my acne prone skin. I already have a hit, humid climate to contend with this summer! Anyway, this sunscreen is exactly what I needed. It has a strong SPF, it's lightweight even under makeup, and it doesn't leave my face looking white or shiny. It's also very affordable so I will be sticking with it for years to come.
It helps your skin from breaking out
Its sooo thin and melts into your skin! It completely works too. No burns on my face or neck at all!
I paid way too much for a tiny bottle of facial sunscreen at one of those makeup counters in the mall and ended up hating it. A friend suggested I try this one and I'm happy I listened.This sunscreen goes on smooth, it's not greasy at all and doesn't clog my pores. Even the expensive sunscreen made me break out but this doesn't do that at all. It also doesn't leave me with that terrible sunscreen smell all day. I put it on and as soon as I rub it in the smell is gone. I also love the size of the package, this will last my girls and I most of the summer. I'm quite happy with this product.
I normally do not write extensive reviews but I need people to be very aware of this product! As stated in other reviews, this product on this account may be dupe and to not use for sensitive skin. I DO NOT HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND NEVER HAVE! My skin is also not acne prone. The most acne I have ever had in my life was due to stress and that stress has been recent. You can see in the before picture of my skin just the day before I started using the product. I have primarily smooth skin even using other sunscreen and moisturizing products daily. As soon as I started to use this product, I got a bunch of tiny bumps, my skin became itchy, and I woke up with a patch that was completely CHEMICALLY BURNED. As for sunscreen protection goes, the product is so thick that I am sure it protected from sun burn but did not protect my skin at all. If you look closely to my photo attached, there is literal liquid coming from my forehead that has never happened. It stings and itches incredibly. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. GO TO THE STORE.
This is one of the few facial sunscreens that’s does not break me out or leave an oily finish to my skin. I use it daily.
After 10 minutes of wearing, this stuff flakes off ... There's no way I could even wear this under makeup let alone leave the house whenever time I touch my neck or face this stuff just comes off in chunks.
I have combination acne prone skin. It’s super lightweight after the aplication but feels kinda dry, doesn’t make me oily at all, but It does STING the eyes so much, my eyes are normally super sensitive, but it’s a chemical sunscreen, so, for the type of spf that’s kinda the usual.Also, it didn’t came with a plastic to cover the hole of the applicator, so I don’t know if someone could opened it before.
Kind of thick for my liking and even though it says oil free it is still kind of greasy. It does well protecting against the sun and seems to last all day.
Put 5* for moisturizing but I’m not sure how it works on that aspect because I also apply a couple other products before sunscreen, but it does not give me the oily shine which I was afraid it would. Smells like sunscreen, which is... expected... since it’s sunscreen, idk what everyone expected lolHave not gotten more acne or less acne since I began application, I use it every morning to go to classes and in the mid afternoon for another set of classes.
This is a very thin runny lotion. It's easy to spread and absorbs quickly. It leaves no white residue on your skin like traditional Zinc Oxide lotions.I apply this in the morning every day and don't see new pimples forming during the day. Although not advertised, this lotion actually reduced the redness of existing acne. When I have dead skin, I can see it slightly moisturizing, but definitely not as well as a normal lotion.The quantity is substantial. I've been using it for more than a month and I still have half left.As for the sun blocking abilities, I haven't gotten burned once. Just be careful about placing it near your eyes and playing strenuous sports. This lotion stings like crazy when you sweat and the sweat carries the lotion into your eyes. Your eyes will be watering for a good 10 minutes.
I’ve tried a few products and they are either too greasy or make me break out. This products does neither, it’s doesn’t leave any streaks and I can barely tell I’m wearing anything on my face. The formula is super thin and after rubbing a generous amount on my palms then applying it to my face the white undertone is completely dissolved.
Great sunblock. I have had no extra breakouts since using this. As in, this hasnt caused any.  I mix it with a drop foundation (Nyx), to create a tinted sunblock. My skin looks nice and dewey after. Also works fine alone or just under makeup. Avoid eyes of course,... it stings lol! The scent is light, like a plain sunblock. Which is nice for something going on your face. This does sell at your local Wal-Mart (Texas), but i did find it a tad cheaper here on Amazon. :)
When I ordered this item, it was called "Neutrogena Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid-Lotion Sunscreen SPF 55 3 oz (Pack Of 3)", which was reflected in my order form. The price was $7.99, but I only received 1. The price has since gone down, but if you think you're getting a really great deal, you probably aren't going to receive 3 in the mail for this price.
I'm a loyal customer of many different Neutrogena products, so I figured I'd give this sunscreen a try. First, it's obvious that the formula stands up to Neutrogena's claims. It's very light, doesn't feel oily at all, didn't cause any break outs, etc. It also did a great job of protecting my face from the sun, and for that reason I almost wish that there was an SPF 15 option. The only thing I didn't like about this product (and the reason why it gets 4 stars instead of 5) is how thin/runny it is. Makes for a pretty messy application experience.
I've always hated sunscreen: the smell, the cakey feeling it leaves, etc. But then I started to care about wrinkles and scarring that the sun can exacerbate, so I knew I had to give in and start using sunscreen regularly.I'm so glad I found this sunscreen/sunblock because it is awesome! I use it multiple times a week, whenever I plan on spending time in the sun, and it doesn't make me break out. It's a super light, thin liquid and soaks in right away. I can apply it multiple times throughout the day if necessary and it never makes my face feel oily or cakey. The best part, though, is the smell (or lack thereof)! It is very subtle and doesn't smell like normal sunscreen.Five stars for making me want to wear sunscreen and effectively protecting my skin!
Great protection. Only thing is that it leaves a powder or white shadow or line on face. Also can dry powder like if you don't rub it in right.
This is the only sunscreen I put on my face. It is oil free and is one of the only sunscreens that does not make my face breakout. I also use it on my hair part (because that’s the only part of me that burns) and I love that it does not make my hair greasy!
I love this product i was looking for an invisible sunscreen and that is just what this is. Suitable for black people and has a light subtle sent nothing crazy. I love it. There’s definitely a warming/ burning sensation when you put it on Maybe wait awhile after washing your face before you put this on.
I received this product yesterday and they (2) do not have the foil sealed inside on the spout.I remember what i bought from the store has a sealed.
This sunscreen works as, you guessed it, sunscreen. I do not have a problem with acne, which is what this particular version claims not to cause, so I can't say wether it is effective in that way. When I purchased it, though, the search I put in was "matte sunscreen" because I do not like being super shiny just because I don't want wrinkles, spots and skin cancer. This product doesn't claim to be matte, but it did come up in the search. It is NOT matte. My face is just as shiny when I use it as any other sunscreen.
This is great facial sunscreen. Highly recommend for acne prone skin!
I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin. My skin HATES sunscreens. This is the first to ever work for me without causing massive breakouts. It goes on matte, which is awesome, but after sweating a while in the sun, it can start to feel/appear oily. That's gross. But, it still doesn't cause me to breakout the way every other sunscreen does. Very satisfied.
I previously purchased CeraVe with SPF which costs 3 times as much for a smaller bottle with half the SPF and I really disliked it. It got very grainy when I tried to rub it in. I saw this Neutrogena sunscreen on sale and figured it was worth a shot and I really like it. It leaves a little bit more shine on my face which I don't love, but it feels light, rubs in really well, and is easy to apply makeup over. I'll definitely buy again.
I loved the sunscreen.  Very easy to spread, and sun protection is excellent for skin with melasma.  Moisturizes the skin without leaving the skin oily.  I really loved the sunscreen.
A very good sunscreen.  Nice scent
I am a person with special oil skin. After receiving the goods, I feel fresh and absorbed quickly. It is not heavy like water emulsion. No rubbing mud, slightly white, small easy to carry, the package feels frosted and feels good. Prepare to buy back all year round. Highly recommended to you!
I think I'm allergic to this. It makes my eyes water every time I wear it.
I apply this sunscreen to my face, neck, and chest when I go to the pool. I love that it spreads easily and doesn’t give me a greasy feel. I was a little concerned because I get cystic acne any time I use sunscreen or any face moisturizer not given by my dermatologist. This product gave me ZERO breakouts! It’s not completely weightless, but it’s not heavy enough to make me feel like my pores are clogged up. Definitely going to keep using this product!
It says what is said but I took one star off because I sweat all over my face as soon as I put the sunscreen on.
Great sunscreen for your face. Doesn’t burn or sting and you can wear it under makeup!! Won’t clog pores.
Got a couple of these for taking on a trip to Disneyland, and it worked great for keeping my family from getting any sunburns. We've had reactions to some cheaper sunscreens on our kids before, so I wanted something with high SPF as well as minimal chance of side effects, and it went very smoothly. It was also pretty easy to put on - not as simple as a spray, but I've just never liked how those felt myself.
I used to use a different neutrogena face sunscreen, but due to the fact that i have very acne prone skin, i switched to this one. I have had no breakouts since started using it.No harsh smell. It blends into the skin nicely and doesnt leave a white film on my face.**If you find my review helpful, please hit the Helpful button.**
I really like how this product works.  Didn't breakout or get sunburned.  Just remember to reapply!
I have extremely sensitive skin and the sunscreen save my face on vacation! I did not get sunburnt and did not break out.
I've used two tubes of this already and after trying several it's still my favorite. It's perfect to wear under makeup and it's absorbs extremely fast and leaves my skin with absolute no oil residue, it may sound weird but it leaves my skin feeling like a put a primer on, really soft and even.The protection is quite high so I recommend it. I have sensitive skin and I had have no issues. I've been trying to get on the Mineral Sunscreen train but I simply don't do well with the white cast or the oily feeling those give me afterwards, especially after having tried this one.
This is my fav sunscreen. I've tried several other facial sunscreens, but this is the only one that 1. doesn't break me out, and 2. doesn't make me very greasy. I have very sensitive eyes and I've never had a problem with this product, unlike other reviewers. Mostly because I don't put this anywhere near my eyes. *You should prob keep ANY sunscreen away from your eyes*I use this by mixing 1 part sunscreen and 1 part CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion to make it more spreadable. Highly recommend this if you're prone to breakouts/have oily skin but still want sun protection!
This sun block works very well, medium drying, and works very well at protecting your face against the sun rays. The only thing is that it leaves skin a little white and also looks oily for about 10 mins. Once it sets in, it feels perfect
I have acne prone skin and a lot of sunscreens are too thick and heavy and tend to clog my pores but not this one! I’ve been using it for a couple weeks now and I absolutely love it! Absorbs quickly into the skin and doesn’t leave a white cast. It doesn’t irritated my skin and provides awesome sun protection. I will definitely be buying this again!
Great sunscreen for oily, acne skin. No white cast, not overly shiny, and doesn’t feel heavy on your face. Also, haven’t experienced any breakouts from the sunscreen. It’s also easy to wash off with a regular facial cleanser.
I have combo oily skin and I was hoping this would work well. Unfortunately it made me look oily in a matter of hours and dripped white streaks down my face.
This defininetly gonna be my go to for now on . I always  use this brand but the other blue tube spf which is heavier than this . This one is actual liquid and it’s spf 50 I used it today and hands down wonderful spf with makeup it’s not greasy or heavy . I love it .I knew I’d come back and buy more because now my adult daughters love this one as well so I had to get few more .
This product protects  my face from the sun rays. I apply a moisturizer first, then the sunscreen before my makeup.
I tend to have dry skin but I hate the oiliness of lotions with SPF.  Words can't describe how incredible it is to rub in and you can't tell you put anything on.  It soaks evenly and easily into the skin and is nice to know the sun isn't destroying my face, especially living in AZ where the sun is plentiful.
I love this! It looks and feels more like moisturizer than sunscreen. It makes my skin look and feel good... like there is nothing on it!! Absolutely love it!
I applied this about an hour before sun exposure, again right before going into the sun, and 15 minutes later again before going into the water. I was not going to let sun burn ruin my vacation!!.  I’m fair skinned and burn easily with other sunscreens.  I did not burn at all with this!! However, my son did burn (luckily he tans quickly and was fine within a day) BUT the reason is he applied and then almost immediately went into the water.  I strongly recommend this product and recommend applying it in layers periodically before sun exposure.
Reasonably easy to apply and relatively matte. Not as good as ombrelle ultra fluid, but much cheaper.
Overall a great product. I suffer from acne due to oily skin and I have to be very careful with what products I put on my face. After doing some research this product was recommended for acne prone skin. I’ve been using it for about a month now and it’s been great and hasn’t caused any breakouts. Only downfall is that it’s a bit hard to spread throughout your face. Other than that I’m very satisfied.
Updated review: This stuff makes me sweat more, and then my eyes sting. Stopped using it above the eyes.**Original review: I have used the 55 at the pool and for a power walk. I was great for pool use, spreads extremely well and absorbs fast. I also used it for a walk under FL sun and that didn't go well ... I swear it made me sweat more than usual and then it started to sting in my eyes. I'll find something else for sport and beach use.
I have a lot of acne, and this is the only sunscreen that has helped me with breakouts. It's easy to spread and it doesn't leave your face feeling greasy.
So being a male, and having sensitive skin I have very particular needs for sun screen. First it has to absorb and go on smoothly. It has to last, but not feel greasy or oily. Lastly for me It can't cause breakouts or be harsh on my skin. I have to say Neutrogena checks every box on my list. I would defiantly recommend this sunscsreen.
I bought this because the reviews said it would be perfect. Turns out not for me, I have oily skin and apply a layer everyday for a week and little by little I started to break out. So a no no from me.
I am fair skinned and I bike commute in a very hot/humid climate, so I need to wear sunscreen on a daily basis. The problem is that every sunscreen I've tried on my face makes me break out! Enter Clear Face Break-out Free sunscreen. I'm very happy with this product. This is the only sunscreen I've found that doesn't make my face break out!I have forgotten to bring it with me to reapply on occasion and regretted it, since I have to use my banana boat, inevitably bringing about half a dozen pimples in my T zone. Now that I'm using this product my skin is clear and protected. Recommended if you struggle with sunscreens making you break out.
I have combination, sensitive skin. The kind that if not moisturized, it will have a thick layer of oil, but still flake underneath. This is the first sunscreen I've found that doesn't break me out. In fact, it is mattifying and I think helps to reduce my sebaceous filaments. It also works beautifully as a primer under makeup, although I only wear face makeup on special occasions. I apply this product multiple times a day, with no excessive drying and no breakouts!! Would give more than 5 stars if I could.
This stuff really works. I live in Florida and I have acne prone skin as an adult. I was apprehensive about using any sunscreen on my face. This works amazingly and it hasn’t made me break out at all since I started using it. I reapply it often and sweat and my face still stays clear from breakouts and I get full protection from the sun. It’s incredible! I have a friend that uses it too. It’s really great!
Great product! Doesn’t leave white traces like most sun screens. It’s just the right amount of moisturizing - doesn’t leave the face oily neither does it dry up the skin. I use it only for my face and chose this product because I have acne. It’s perfect - doesn’t clog pores, not oily. I used one tube for about 6 months, using only on face and neck everyday.
I have fair skin and it is a little sensitive.  I felt only a slight tingling when first applied.  It is definitely a sunscreen.  It requires moisturizer to be applied on top, along with make-up if you want to wear it.  I didn't try it when I went swimming, so I don't know if it is water-proof. Directions say to re-apply after 80 minutes of swimming.
It spreads really nice and absorbs super quick. Doesn’t smell or sting your eyes when you start to sweat. But I still get a bunch of white heads after using it. Despite washing my face!
As usual, Neutrogena does it again! This is very moisturizing and easy to spread. I feel like I get great sun protection from the FL sun!
I have sensitive skin but this sunscreen didn’t break me out or anything. I haven’t gotten sunburn since using. I do need to reapply more than what I’m used to but it still works well
I absolutely love this sunscreen!! It doesn't leave your skin oily! I was telling my husband it feels moisturizing but yet almost like you don't have anything on your skin! It's such a nice change from the very oily sunscreens I have used!
Great but will leave your face looking a little white!
Spreads and rubs in really well but still provides good protection.
I've tried so many face sunscreens and couldn't stand any of them until this one.  No chemical smell, no white mask effect, light, easy to spread, and doesn't give me whiteheads.  This will be the only one I use.
No issue with the product. However, it plainly states "Pack of 3" on listing.  Only received one.  Same product is available at Walmart for less money. This type  of error should favor the purchaser and honor what is stated.  Three items were expected to arrive, not one.  Understand item is nonrefundable, but want what was promised.UPDATE:  Have since contacted Amazon to explain error and was immediately resolved with total satisfaction. Will continue to buy with confidence.
Finally, a sunscreen that doesn't cause my face to break out in tiny little pimples!I am so happy with this product. I noticed a slight burning sensation when applying that had me worried for a moment, but within a few moments it was gone. My face didn't burn and it didn't look shiny or greasy, and it was easy to apply and rub in. Even my 13 year old didn't complain, and he's really picky about sunscreens!
I've used this every day since they finally came out with non-oily sunscreen with an spf over 15 back in the 90's. Warning: put a barrier around your eyes and don't let it run into your eyes because it will burn. I use a thicker lotion on my eyes to keep this from happening. I like the spf and it's not too greasy and doesn't break me out. I use it as a moisturizer under my makeup most days.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
This is my favorite face sunscreen.I use it multiple times a day. It’s easy to apply. No white face.  Feels light.  No breakouts. Leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth.The 70 proof by this brand gave me breakouts.
This is the only SPF that didn't clog my pores and I've tried more than dozens. If you put it too close to your eyes, it'll sting pretty bad.  I use Blue Lizards for sensitive skin around my eye areas. Also if you are a Retin a user, you should avoid it when your skin is flaking off.  Otherwise your face will feel like it's on fire. Other than that it's an excellent SPF for people with oily or acne-prone skin.
it made my skin burn but not my boyfriend's. I would say you should stay away if you tend to have sensitive and dry skin like me
I'm comparing this sunblock to another one I have and this one just feels very heavy on the face. There's always thick residue at the end of the day. At least for me and how it feels on my skin, I won't be buying it again.
I have very sensitive skin and I break out easily with some products. I have been using this daily and it has not bothered my skin at all. It’s not greasy at all and I can’t even tell I’m wearing it. Works great.
Great sunscreen for your face. I add some to my moisturizer. It is not greasy and blends well.
Really like it
Good For acne or oily skin.
I have sensitive skin/acne prone(at 38 😒) and so far after 4 uses, no issues. (Fingers crossed)I use under my face powder.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
I like the product fairly well.  It absorbs quickly.  Is not greasy and does not make my makeup look oily.  It does still make me breakout but not as bad as some other brands.  I would purchase again.
Thanks Neutrogena.  A product to protect me from skin cancer...with carcinogens in it.  I just ordered Badger sunscreen instead and am very happy with it.  It's also not an endocrine disrupter like this product and other traditional sunscreens.  I used to like Neutrogena products because they were easy to spread, but with how toxic they are it just isn't worth it.
I love how well it works for my oily face. It doesnt leave me looking white when i apply it on and it doesnt break me out at all. of course i clease my face everyday with CeraVE and moisturize as well. but great sunscreen overall.
I have purchased this 5 times and it is part of my daily routine.  I use other skin treatments, and then finish with this a few minutes after.  It goes on easily and dries with in 5 minutes.  Even coverage and I get about 5 hours use before having to reapply.  I work construction and I am outside a lot.  It is not my only treatment, though on days when I am outside for 30 minute clips or driving a lot it is perfect.
The adhesive is super strong the min u put it on the surface it sticks like a champ.
I bought this sunscreen and felt a burning sensation similar to what others have described, and am now getting strange welt-like red marks in in those areas, where I normally have little to no blemishes. It is definitely not acne. I have not experienced chemical burns before so I don't know if that's what it is, but other people have offered that explanation and it seems plausible. I cannot comment on how "fake" this product is as I have never tried the supposedly "real" thing, but the small number of negative rumors seem to be true and I suspect the high number of positive reviews might be bot generated.
Great product for acne sensitive skin.This is the only sun block that  didnt give me pimples after using. Love it
I use this on my face to keep my hyperpigmentation from getting darker. It’s like a lotion but once it’s rubbed on it feels thicker. The only issue is that it leaves a small grey cast on the face.
I have used this cream for a long time. I am buying it because it also provides protection from UVrays. How much protection it provides I have no way of knowing.
Preface: I have acne prone, relatively oily skin.The formulation is really wonderful.  The product comes out liquid, and as you're working the product into your skin, you get the sensation that the product evaporates -- it literally feels like you have nothing on! I usually use the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer, and decided to give it a try.  While the Ultra Sheer was good, I found it just the tiniest bit too greasy for me, so I was really pleased when I tried this one.  The SPF 55 was good for the summer, and I look forward to trying out this formula in SPF 30 when I finish up this tube.
I bought this for a trip to have a small size for my face, but I really don’t use it that much. It smells nice, feels ok, but I would not buy this particular one again.
I tried several sunscreens in the past for oily skin, all of them left me with a slightly greasy feeling in the skin, unlike those, this one has the best matte feeling that I like, absorb quick into the skin and doesn’t leave any residue. However, it may have a heavy consistency but once I applied it's works fine for me.
30 spf is really nice that I don’t need tanning and it reflects all the heat and protects from uv. It also do not affect my skin since it is oil free, so I also do not have a breakouts.
No white cast on dark skin!! Great price. I highly recommend this SPF because it dries completely clear. Once it’s dry, it will flake off if you touch it so I don’t know how it would do under makeup but as the top layer, it works great!
I had to stop using this, as it burned my face and caused raised dry spots near my eye / upper cheek. Not a fault of the product, but if you’re sensitive, like me, then be warned that this may have chemical sunscreen or irritants (?)Didn’t have any kind of tamper seal, which is weird and possibly not okay. The product itself is good, though I’m a little disappointed that it does not say noncomedogenic on the actual packaging, which may mean it is not technically noncomedogenic. Ceryl dimethicone is the 3rd ingredient.Overall, I like the feel, but I’m weirded out by the lack of a tamper seal (does it normally have one?), and by the fact that it basically just says break out free, not noncomedogenic on the packaging.
I suffer from acne since I’m a teen, until today I struggle everyday to treat it, I knew sunscreen was important but I refused to used it because each one I tried would break out my skin horribly! UNTIL I FOUND THIS ONE! No 1 single pimple!! NADA! Also some of my blemishes are disappearing too!!! I’m so happy!
Seems to do the trick for sun protection. It is easy to apply - looks white at first but blends in. Has gotten an “2” rating from EWG as being fairly safe to use.
This facial lotion works pretty well but it's a little on the runny side so it's hard to squeeze out the correct amount.  Otherwise, it seems to be find.
When I lived in Hawaii, this was one of my "Go to's". When the UV index wasn't super high, this is the sunblock I would use. I have very sensitive skin and break out easily. I was concerned that this would happen with this sunblock. Not the case. If anything, it made my face softer and definitely protected against sunburn. I like to remind people that it is important to apply sunscreen 30 minutes before exposure, to ensure efficacy. This always did the trick, but I had to make sure I reapplied at least once through the day. I would for sure recommend this to others that had the same concerns as myself.
As shown, you can't see the sunscreen at all when its on. Worked really nicely for garden work (4 hours)
I've tried SO MANY sunscreens, and everything except for this one just wrecks the texture of my skin with congestion. So gross. Even the more "quality" expensive ones from Sephora. This works better for me under daily makeup than anything else I've tried.  Takes a few minutes to soak in, but after that I am golden (well, not really because it's also VERY protective). Love this stuff for all seasons.
It kinda watery but it gives a good protection from the sun
This worked well for me on my face, hands, and arms. Protected me from the strong California sun on my walks without making me feel greasy or hot and without making me break out.
The solution has worked great on my face so far! I do tend to feel "slick" after using it, like really fresh moisturizer, but it doesn't feel heavy. I've had no problems with sweat making it run. I don't wear makeup with it.
Good, light for oily face.
I love this sunscreen! It's perfect in every way. It gives excellent protection, doesn't create a white residue on my skin, isn't greasy or drying, and is easy to spread and use. It also is a good price. Highly recommend.
I was hesitant to use sunscreen on my face because most of them make my face feel so greasy and cause me to break out! This product exceeded my expectations. Its does not make my skin break out and it acts as a good primer whenever I put on my foundation. I have not had any problems with it! Plus it keeps me protected for the whole day.
I like the moistureI didn’t like the smell it’s kinda different what I use
As promised, this doesn't make my face break out. I'm impressed. I don't have oily skin, nor do I break out often, but any kind of sunscreen makes me break out. I also have very fair skin and need sunscreen, so I had to do something. I will definitely be buying this again. I does sting ever so slightly immediately after application, but it's not at all greasy. It dries quickly and without residue. Stays on all day. I can walk outside in the sun and come back burned on my arms but never on my face.
If you’ve got sensitive eye skin, get a different product. If you THINK you MIGHT have sensitive eye skin, get a different product.I was so relieved when I used up the last of this and could buy something else, lol.
I’ve been using this every morning for 2 years now. It’s the perfect sunscreen to wear under makeup. It does come out white, and you may have a whitish cast when you first put it on but it dries clear. I have pretty oily skin but I don’t notice an issue with my skin being oilier throughout the day. It’s also the perfect amount of moisturizing in the morning.
Just had some facial laser and this was recommended by doctor. Light fragrance and smooth application
Bought for my acne-prone 16 year old son. Works great and not oily in the least. His face is sensitive due to his proactive skin care regimen, and this lotion does not irritate or sting. Highly recommend.
I searched for hours upon hours to find the perfect sunscreen that I could wear under my makeup. This was perfect! Hint is to put this on and let dry a little goes a kind way, then follow up with a translucent powder.
I like this so using  from last one yr only problem  is bit oily may be not good for oily skin my skin is dry to normal  so this work good.
It absorbs well, non greasy, offers good protection. My dermatologist wants me to put on sunscreen every day. This is my "go to" product.
Okay even though it says oil free on it, I still figured it would be at least a LITTLE bit oily.But it wasn’t! It felt just like putting lotion!I can’t wait to continue to keep using this every day!
I love this. I have extremely sensitive skin and this never bothers me!
I’m a big believer in sunscreen. Hence I try a lot of different sunscreen. But I always find myself coming back to Neutrogena. Clear face liquid is my top fav so far. It’s liquid. Mild moisture, which is perfect for my normal to oily skin. High SPF. Does not turn white on your face. Make up friendly. And easy on your wallet. It is absolutely the perfect 10 to me.
I love this! I have sensitive skin from my acne medications and this doesn't bother me a bit. Nor do I break out. After applying this, there is a dewy finish left on my skin. I usually just mattify it with some translucent powder and then layer my makeup on top and it looks great. This isn't heavy or thick, so you don't have to worry about it making your make up cakey. I have oily skin and after I mattify with the powder, my make still looks good for about 8 hours, wearing this under it. I really like this product and I will be repurchasing in the future.
Just want to start off that I have been using Neutrogena products for over 20years on and off depending on availability.  Great products for my combination skin.  This is a sunblock lotion with SPF 30 for your face and not a moisturizing lotion with SPF which they also have for the mens line  with heliolpex that seems to be a lot harder to find these days (the 30 SPF one).  Anyways, this is a great sunblock that they have promised to not cause breakouts.  So far so good.  No breakouts.  This leaves a light matte finish on the face.  Nothing kabuki theater like...so don't be afraid...very light...not noticeable at all.  Again, it's a sunblock and not a moisturizer.  I think the way it's worded on the amazon product description can be slightly misleading/easily misunderstood.
WOW! This literally changed my life.It doesn't break me out at all.It protects my skin like it says, I don't get freckles like I used to before this...It keeps my face moisturized too.The price is right! and it does everything it says.Please don't ever stop producing these :)
This is the first sunscreen I've use that did not cause my face to breakout. I've used it on vacation and now use it daily without any problems under my makeup. I have very sensitive skin with some roseasa and this sunscreen doesn't clog pores or irritate my skin. Dries quickly, absorbed into skin in just a minute. Don't rub too much or it just rubs off.  Smooth on, let it absorb into the skin and you're ready to go. You do have to reapply after sweating but it does dry quickly.
I’ve been looking for a sunscreen that won’t cause my skin to breakout- this one take the win! Not too greasy, doesn’t leave a white film after you rub it in which seems to be rare for a high SPF. And no breakouts!
Product worked as expected.
I use this stuff every day. I have super sensitive skin. I get break outs from looking at oil, and most skincare products make my skin red and blotchy and sting - even ones that are supposed to be "soothing" or for "sensitive skin".I would definitely rather go bare-skinned, but you know, UV radiation and all that. Most sunscreens are a double whammy of breakouts and irritation, but this one is not so bad. For me, that's basically a miracle.
Doesnt leave a white cast and absorbs well into the skin also I have oily/combination skin and Ive been using for a few weeks and have no seen any breakouts or irritation, I will be buying again after I run out
Not greasy at all and does not make my skin breakout. Will deff be buying again
I recommend this Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen.  It's lightweight & doesn't leave a white residue.  If I want more protection than I use Neutrogena Ultra Sheer® Face + Body Stick Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 70.
I have pretty sensitive skin and was breaking out too much from the neutrogena zinc physical sunscreens so I tried this. Much better from a breakout perspective.Also since it’s not a physical sunscreen but instead a chemical one it’s much easier to apply and spread.
I have acne prone/sensitive skin. The uttermost worst skin combo on the planet. It is so hard to find a sunscreen that doesn’t turn me into a grease ball and wake up the next day with pimples all over. This does the job!!! No breakouts and absolutely no sun burn. Will always be a staple at my house! Great price compared to target as well!
This sunscreen is really effective. I use it every day with my BB cream and have never been burned with it- I do reapply if actually being in the sun.  It goes on very smoothly and isn't greasy at all, which is great when wearing with makeup.  My only complaint would be the ingredient list, some of the ingredients aren't the safest.
Best facial sunscreen ever. I am very prone to acne. I can use this every day more than once a day and I don't break out. And my hyperpigmentation is fading since I started using it a month ago.
Doesn't feel thick on the face and does a good job of protecting. I use this while i rock climb and it doesn't run or get ruined with sweat so it doesn't get into my eyes.
Great product, trusted name brand. Our dermatologist recommended this product for our motorcycle riding days.
This is a quality sunscreen to protect your face from the harsh summer sun.  When using it we didn't get burned. It's easy to apply and smooths well across the skin.
i have oily skin  and this one didn't leave my skin oily, perfect matte finish. didn't cause me any breakouts. and didn't leave a white cast.
Came on time and worked fine
Nice and thin and dries clear. A little goes a long way. And I haven’t had a breakout with it so far.
This blends right onto skin.
I LOVE this sunscreen. It is not oily at all and it feels like I’m just wearing moisturizer, not sunscreen. I don’t know if it actually improves acne, because I typically don’t have acne, but it definitely doesn’t cause acne (which other facial sunscreens seem to do for me). It’s more pricey than typical facial sunscreen, but it’s definitely worth it.
I love this sunscreen. It does go on white, but it is easy to blend in and absorb into your skin. The product can be put right above your eyes and in the sun and heat, even if you are sweating, it will not run into your eyes. The product is odor free and great for your face. It does not make your skin feel oily and after a few days of repeat use I did not notice any additional oil on my face. The product does not stain white clothing.
Yep, sunscreen it is. I kinda like that it is not that greasy.
I wouldn't say I'm necessarily acne-prone but the combo of sunscreen and sweaty beach days always tends to break me out.  In the past I've used Coppertone Faces and wasn't impressed.  I've used this a handful of times now and I like it much better.  It goes on smoother and less greasy feeling and no break outs or sunburns.  Definitely recommended.
I would prefer a little bit, just a little bit, thicker!
I have fair skin and burn very easily in the sun, so sunscreen is a necessity for me. However, I hate the smell and the greasy feel of sunscreen. So I went on a hunt tofind a non-greasy, little to no scent sunscreen that still protected me. This product does all of that. I put it on and it soaked in within 5 minutes. I was able to wear a full face of makeup over it (Bare Minerals original powder makeup) with no smell, no greasy feel, no sunburn, and my makeup stayed put all day in the sun! It really is a great product! I'm so happy I found it!
It is not oily and the sunscreen smell does not stay on ur skin all day. Gives a nice moisturizer for my face. My dark spots are reducing. And it is not making me break out. Like it a lot.
I really like how this sunscreen applies. It is not as thick as the traditional sunscreens that I am accustomed to which I find makes it easier to spread around my face. This quality also makes the sunscreen feel light on my screen and not oily and shiny. My skin was well protected by the pool, and I did not have acne flairs from using this product.
good
Really good sunscreen spreads easily
I use this religiously every day year round---mainly for the SPF, but there is a decent amount of moisture to it too.  At the same time, it's not oily and doesn't clog my skin or cause break-outs!  My skin just doesn't feel the same without it.  In winter, I generally have to use an additional moisturizer, but this does the trick in summer.
Leaves a very soft finish to the skin, almost feels like power sugar when dried to the skin but in the best way. Subtle sunscreen scent that goes away quickly, leaves my skin moisturized and not greasy
Oh my gosh I love it
I have a acne prone skin and been using this not a single one break out and plus it goes really good in your skin I work in construction so I'm almost everyday outdoors so it doesn't give you the white flaky skin look glad bought it
This sunscreen is nearly perfect.  My face feels good when I put it on.  I do feel moisturized, and I don't think it is that heavy.  My one caveat is once you put it on, when you eat or drink, you will taste the sunscreen and that is not spectacular.
This is a lightweight, broad-spectrum sunscreen that will NOT break you out. Perfect for oily skin, it goes on easily and blends well. At first you will think you are going to look like a ghost because of the white "tinge" it leaves, but it absorbs quickly. It does not make your skin overly oily, although it is lightly moisturizing. Remember to reapply every 2 hours! I have sensitive skin and rosacea AND acne,and this does not irritate me at all.
This works really well. I always put it on in the morning and it keeps me from getting sun burnt at my job. Been learning more and more about long term skin damage from sun exposure so this is a must have for men and women.
I’ve been using this as a moisturizer and sunscreen before makeup and I really enjoy it! Not too greasy for more oily/acne prone skin. Wish the packaging was a bit different but otherwise it’s great!
Doesn't leave a film or residue. Basically no odor. I'm prone to breakouts -- and this has never caused any!Don't get it into your eyes though.
I like it because it works like a good moisturizer and sunscreen. It protects my face so it doesn't get sun damaged. I've been using this brand for about 4 years and I think it is the best.
I like it but sometimes I feel like it's making my skin darker.
Its not greasy and I haven't had any breakouts while using it. It's easy to apply and doesn't leave a white film on my skin (I have a medium-tan complexion). Would buy again
This is hands down the best sunblock I have ever used. I've purchased multiple name brand facial sunscreens, my favorite being Shiseido. The Neutrogena is far superior than any of them.My face is extremely oily anti oil products never seem to work. This sunblock makes my face matte. It works perfect under makeup and doesn't become heavy at all. I actually use it as a primer.When getting in the pool this sunscreen has staying power. It doesn't drip into the eyes at all.If you're contemplating if you should get it, stop and just purchase it already.
As soon as you spread it, you feel the unconfort in your eyes. It makes you cry u til you wash it out.
I have an oily face and easily to get break out. However, even when I wore a protecting mask for hours, I have never get an acne from it.
This sunscreen has a great level of SPF, but it doesn't do it for me as a facial sunscreen. I wore it every day for a couple of weeks and it definitely made my skin a little greasy. It also tended to make my skin burn a little bit (probably from the treatment included), which is why I stopped using it before emptying the tube. Perhaps this would work better for those with skin that isn't finicky, but I will not be purchasing again.
I do not like the feel of most sunscreens on my face. Even ones that are marketed as non greasy or oil free still leave me with a shiny face and a texture that I can feel. Even the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer leaves a bit of a sheen, stings my eyes a bit, and has a fragrance. Not this Clear Face product though. It is transparent, light feeling, doesn't clog my pores, and is water resistant. The ONLY thing I wish is that it was a mineral sunscreen (zinc oxide) instead of a chemical one, but I have tried many mineral sunscreens for the face and none have been as transparent and non oily as this one. Highly recommended!!!
Love this sunscreen! Wish it had zinc!
Was ready to pay out the ass for some name brand Asian sunscreen, but Covid19 said no to international shipping. This does the job well for the money, and most importantly, no alcohol.
Good
It's very light weight and feels good on my skin. Makes it soft. Not greasy.  It dries quicklyAlso does not cause breakouts. Already used it couple times. Works for me
This is a bit oilier feeling than the Biore UV Aqua sunscreen I used previously. It has a white cast initially that disappears quickly. It leaves my skin feeling a bit tacky and a bit shiny. However, it hasn't caused any skin concerns and my usual makeup layers over it great. I may get the Biore next time just because it soaks into my skin a bit faster and feels nicer.
Non greasy- goes on just like a moisturizer no white sunscreen residue
I mixed up the old tube with the new one...my apologies to the vendor!
It actually makes me breakout, switching to a different natural sunscreen with not these ingredients
Super lightweight while still providing a lot of protection. Bought this for a hiking trip and didn’t even get a touch of sun on my face
Product is great for sensitive skin but actual tube was all covered with black magic markings .
I’ve been using it for a while and my skin has gotten so bad…
Great price for a nice product!  It's a good idea to have a different one for your face and neck than the rest of your body.  I like this one!
Doesn’t leave the awful gray tint on black skin which is what I was looking for. It dissolves and absorbs fast not leaving a film of grease
Doesn’t leave a residue on your skin like most sunscreens. Plus it doesn’t clog pores. Excellent everyday sunscreen.
Omg I'm super happy with this productI'm African American medium tone and lot of sunscreen products for the face will leave my face gray and chalky no matter of it says clear or not ...... but this product doesnt exact what it says comes out white goes on clear I'm super happy no gray skin over here ❤❤
It gave me allergies, not easy to spread.
Items came damaged in packaging and leaked
I used it twice both times I had a burning feeling upon application I do have sensitive skin I had hopes for it because it is marketed for acne prone skin
Not really moisturizing since it leaves a mat finish but it’s good for protecting your skin.
I bought this to prevent breakouts, not cause them. I've used it on four different trips to the beach and each time, I break out in these tiny whiteheads all over my face. It's crazy- my skin routine has kept my face blemish free (95% of the time) and the day I use this, like clockwork, tiny whiteheads on my forehead, between my eyes, on my cheeks, in my nose creases, on my nose, and especially on my chin.  It does protect from the sun and prevent burning, but certainly caused other problems. I'll be on the lookout for a more acne-friendly product.  I'm disappointed because I've been a Neutrogena fan for years.
Love this stuff! Feels great on your skin, super light, not heavy like regular suntan lotion. I am very pale with freckles and this stuff offers great protection without breaking me out.
love the fact that it is runny and easily applicable  and easy to spread . Unfortunately though,after using it for a while i started getting whiteheads so definitely have to wash my face properly after every day and have to scrub everynow and then.
Ive been on the search for a lightweight sunscreen that doesn't leave my face greasy or covered in a white cast. I think I may have found it. Absorbed quickly and seemed to provide good protection.
Pleased with thistle purchase. It does the job as far as protecting your skin from the sun.
This is the only sunscreen that does not break my face out.  I am careful to wash it off each night.  It absorbs quickly and easily into the skin without residual, feeling oily or any smell.I have used just about every sunscreen out there for the face and this one beats them all.  I've tried ones that are $40 plus and this Neutrogena blows them out of the water.I do suggest though that you are careful to wash it completely off at the end of the day if you are prone to acne.
I love this sunscreen. It us completely weightless and left no white cast. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a lightweight SPF to go on top of a moisturizer!
I bought this product because I use retinol on some nights so my skin needed extra protection during the day. This product does not cause breakouts and it prevents sun burns. I love it.I actually use it once a day.For context, I am 27 years old with dark skin, with acne prone skin.
This one was a great sunscreen and very cheap.
Very clean. Smells like sunscreen. Light enough on the face. Is a little tacky upon application. I would not consider it moisturizing. Works well on top if moisturizer
I'll begin this by saying that I hate most sunscreens or anything oily on my face. Upon application I was pleasantly surprised by the consistentcy. It was very easy to rub in. I wear this before running every day and it seems unphased by rain or sweat. My face doesn't break out (I do wash it off as soon as my run is over though) and very little is needed. This specific product has made its was through my sunscreen refusal. Well done, Neutrogena'
Works greatIs it bit a runnier than other nuetrogena sunblocks which is great for rubbing in the face so it doesn’t take so long and can wear under face powder
Non-greasy and has not caused my skin to break-out.  Does still a little bit, but overall relatively happy.  I have used Elta-MD for years, but it is expensive so was looking for a good alternative for my sensitive acne prone skin and this seems to work just fine for me.
I highly recommend this version over the Neutrogena Sport Face flavor.  That one gave me horrible breakouts as well as NO sun protection.  I ended up with acne and a sunburn from that one.  This Clear Face version provided sunburn protection AND left me with zero breakouts.
Perfect for me, I'm black with oily skin and it doesn't seem to leave a white film on me! You just need to rub it in correctly. And the sunscreen isn't greasy it's like matte.
This has been my go-to facial sunscreen for years--has a light, pleasant smell, isn't too thick or thin, does its job and doesn't make my face break out!
Great facial sunscreen for acne prone skin, personally I didn’t experience any irritation from this sunscreen and I have sensitive skin. I use this with Cearve hydrating cleanser in my skin care routine after moisturizer.
CosDNA approved ingredients, nothing that will cause acne or irritation, and GREAT sun protection. i burn really easily and haven’t gotten burnt once all summer from using this stuff on my face and body. it has also lasted surprisingly long, despite using it for 2 1/2 months, and letting friends/family borrow some.
Very nice easy to spread and smells good. Very lightweight
Works great, easy to apply, not greasy,  and it did not cause any break out or reaction on my sensitive skin. Would buy again.
Peels off when putting makeup on top of it, but overall works well.
Great sun tan lotion for everyday use. I was Recommended this by a friend and will continue to buy as I run out
I love this product.  I have sensitive skin, and this protects me very well and doesn't give me a rash.  I'm so happy!
My favorite sunscreen. Doesn't make me break out. Feels smooth on my skin.
If I use this daily I get breakouts so I only use it when I know I'm going to be outside for a while. It also makes my skin get oily but I never got sunburned while using this.
I have combination skin (semi oily and semi dry). I have acnes but my skin also feels super dry after wash, etc. Past sunscreens felt way to thick and heavy so I never wore on but this one feels so light and moisturizing it literally feels like I’m just putting on lotion
It appeared to be fine but I took away two stars because there was no seal as if the product has been opened.
Good stuff! Do not irritate my sensitive skin.
This product is perfect for my aging skin and works wonders on my teens acne prone skin. It can be used alone as a moisturizer or over your favorite. Either way it doesn’t feel heavy and spreads easily. Plus it’s the only sunscreen that doesn’t run in my eyes and sting them.
Best face sunscreen I've ever used so far. Went on extremely well and love how it's absorbed and doesn't leave my face looking chalky. Loved it
what i love about it is1. doesn't leave white cast and make me look like a ghost2. water resistant3. fast absorbing4. doesn't clog pores and cause break outwhat i don't like is it makes my face look oily and shiny but it's not a big deal because it doesn't actually make my skin oily, just looks a bit shiny.
There is a slight resistance to spread but, I love that it’s not sticky! And doesn’t show up white on my chocolate skin.
It makes me feel oily... but it works great. I used to have really bad cystic acne and I was paranoid of the UV rays causing them to leave darker marks (hyperpigmentation) so if I'm expecting to be outdoors for long periods of time, I use this.This does not work well under make up for me... make up easily melts off. I use both powder and liquid foundation, and sometimes BB cream.
I have very sensitive skin and most face products make me break out - but not this one.  I have never gotten burnt and never breakout after wearing.  I even wear it when exercising and it doesn't run and get into my eyes and cause burning (which others have done).

Moisturizing without being greasy
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
FINALLY!!!!!!! I break out ALL the time from oily lotions and sunscreens and this one doesn't do that to me.  YESSSSS.  I will say, it does sting when it drips into your eyes (from sweat) but I can deal with that because getting big fat zits is way worse!
Great coverage! I wear it everyday but I am a woman of a deep/dark complexion and the product can leave a bit of a blue sunscreen tint. However, it’s great for everyday use. Don’t forget to reapply!
Iv'e tried a lot of sunscreens. I can actually stand this one. As I'm getting ready in the morning I add about two pea size amount to my face wait a couple of minutes and apply my make up as normal. I haven't tried it in water yet but summer is around the corner. I'll update then.
Good product I really like neutrogena, but it’s not good for sport or if you swear a lot!! Its goes to your eyes and it’s terrible
I've used this for a couple years now and it works great. It's a tiny bit greasy but not nearly as bad as some other face sunscreens. I've slathered it on multiple times over the course of the day and *barely* break out. I recommend it.
Non greasy and very moisturizing
This formula soaks right in, is not oily, and leaves skin ready for makeup with a matte finish. I'm so glad I got it!
I specifically chose this sunscreen due to it's oil-free & mattifying effects and have been very pleased with the results.I have oily skin, which gets EXTRA oily in the summer, especially after running outside/getting sun and this sunscreen has helped combat the "you-could-fry-an-egg-on-my-forehead" look that I tend to get when it's hot out. I love that it has 30 SPF to protect against wrinkles and sun damage as well!I will be purchasing this item again once I run out.
It smells nice and doesnt feel thick on the skin.  I can wear it daily without feeling sticky. Would recommend for daily skin protection
I have found that this product works particularly well with my acne-prone skin. I'm super pale and I lived in Santiago, Chile for a few years. I used this daily on my face and I think it really helped protect me from sun-damage with the really intense sun exposure. It doesn't break out my skin, goes on easily, and doesn't make my skin greasy. I'm pretty sure that's all one can really ask of a face sunblock.
I love this sunscreen. My skin is cne prone skin, i hve used many expensive sunscreen product and they are mot that good, cause my face to break out. This Neutrogena sunscreen is the BEST suncreen I have used so far, not causing any breakout. I recommend this to whoever need a suncreen that good for acne skin.
Not nearly as greasy as most sunscreens. This one I can actually tolerate wearing- so hats off to Neutrogena for that one. I took away a star because it did seem to increase blackheads for me- but hey. Black heads are better than skin cancer.
This is my favorite face sunscreen because it doesn’t make me break out. Haven’t tried anything else because there’s no need, this definitely does the job
It leaves a little white residue on my face that’s noticeable only from close up. Otherwise, it does its job.
Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion offered a variety of benefits:1. The lotion went on smooth and rubbed in quickly2. The smell was not overwhelming, and the consistency was slightly watery3. When I got product in my eyes it did not burn with a voracity as other such products.Certain shortcomings included:1. Difficulty rubbing the product into my beard2. Noticed the occurrence of more acne than when I use a similar Cetaphil product3. I cannot let the lotion sit on my face and pretend I am a ghostIn all I would recommend this product, however I will continue to purchase the comparable version of the Cetaphil lotion and sunscreen for my UV protection needs!
I've used tons of different sunscreens on my sensitive, oily, acne prone skin and all have made me break out. This one has by far been the best. Yes. I do get some little bumps from it occasionally, but it's nowhere near as bad as others. I just have difficult skin!It does cause my skin to get shiny and slick in the humidity, but I've never found a sunscreen that doesn't.
This lotion prevented some nasty sunburns on my face in the summer, but I found that this sunscreen bothers my skin. In the first hour after applying, my face began to sting and turn slightly red. Though it eventually goes away, I did not want to run the risk of damaging my skin, so I discontinued use.This has just been my personal experience. Your experience may not be the same as mine because everyone's skin needs are different. It didn't work out for me, but the product did do its job, so I will give it a fairly warm review. Just remember to ALWAYS patch test your skin products!
I’m a melanoma survivor. I use this from head to toe not just in my face. I reapply every couple of hours when I’m in the sun. I only get burned where I forget to apply it which is usually on the back of my neck...my fault not the products.  I love this product.
I used to believe I had a hormonal problem until I went to a dermatologist, who told me I have a very sensitive skin. I am born and raised in NYC, my skin is always exposed to pollution. After spending thousands of dollars, my dermatologist recommended I stop using everything all together and stick with this product-only. I was told to give it six weeks and on the sixth week, miracle happened. I trust this product fully and went on to recommend it to others who has acne problems. I'm going for a chemical peeling, now that my skin has been acne controlled for the past six months, to rid of my scars!

I just got it in the mail today.I'm not sure... but isn't there supposed to be a seal under the cap? Mine came in already opened. But it had shrink wrap on the whole bottle.
Awesome finish. Love this sunscreen
My favorite part of the product is that it doesn’t smell like sunscreen. I use it after washing my face and putting on a vitamin C serum. It doesn’t make my acne more red or my skin oily. It also hasn’t caused any acne on my acne prone skin. It absorbs almost instantly and is a great base for makeup. I love this product and will repurchase!
Everyone should be using this everyday.  It is your best defense from the sun.  Leaves a nice dry finish and I get full spectrum blockage.UPDATE: Downloaded Yuka and found out this has very harmful ingredients.  Discontinued use.
I expected a liquid lotion to be thinner than this, but it feels quite thick. Otherwise feels fine, not too oily, and does well under make up
I was motivated to try this sunscreen after being so tired of the pasty white film and increased acne I consistently experienced with even the Neutrogena "Face" formulation.  I read a review of this sunscreen written by an African American woman who said she was so happy to not look like the character "Data" from Star Trek.  Another woman wrote that this was the only sunscreen that didn't worsen her already severe acne.  I can attest to both of those reviewers being correct--this is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  Any pastiness in my current complexion now is all my own--because the sunscreen is effective!
The best sun protection I ever bought, I have greasy skin and acne and this product is helping me with both.
This is the only sunscreen I use on my face. I've even tried other Neutrogena products and those seem to crumble and leave weird residue. This stuff goes on smoothly (a little goes a long way!), doesn't clog my pores (perfect for my oily face), and protects me from the sun all day long. I've used it for years and would never switch.
I love this sunblock, I don’t have to worry about any breakouts.
Best sun block ever! And the only one I will put on my face. It's NOT the thick pasty stuff that never comes off. Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen goes on smooth and I reapply every two hours or so - NO sunburn. My face feels natural and I love this stuff. Highest recommendation.
It was perfect
Excellent product, it is easily absorbed and hydrates the skin.
I’m on a hunt for a sunscreen for my acne prone skin, this is not the one. I still had breakouts from this one and it also made my face irritated, a little burning. It was also too drying.
I’ve been using this all summer and my face hasn’t broken out at all! I love it! Highly recommend!
I have sensitive skin and this hasn't given me any breakouts yet! I put it over my face lotion and it works great!
This sunscreen is very effective for both pale (my skin) and olive toned/acne prone skin (my wife’s). Works well protecting my pale skin in the sun of Saint Lucia and also worked well at protecting my wife’s face while not causing a breakout.Overall a great sunscreen that’s easy on the skin, so it’s a win! Like this review!
My friends got in a heated debate over whether this is specifically a SUNSCREEN, or a FACE LOTION that also has sunscreen in it after I left it out on my counter. I honestly have no idea which one it is, but I use it as a sunscreen/moisturizer during the summer under my makeup and it's fine. My skin type is normal but tends to get oilier in the summer, so far no issues with this product. 10/10 i keep multiple in my stockpile and will be buying again. :)
I received this product on 5/22 and began using it within a few days. I am using a face cream that causes photosensitivity so I needed some good sun protection. I was excited about this product, until it gave me contact dermatitis. It’s now 7/12, this picture was taken today. It’s been WEEKS and it won’t go away. :(
Love this product! It blended into my skin so nicely. I have oily skin and this product did not cause any issues.
Good

I’m obsessed with this sunscreen! I had been looking for something I could layer under foundation and this is perfect. Amazing matte finish. I have oily/acne prone skin plus I’m outside all day but my face never burns, breaks out, or gets shiny. Plus it’s so cheap!!
This product is, in fact, light-weight and it does not cause acne. I'm using it in conjunction with a Curology blend specially formulated for my face, because they are strict about what other products you can use at the same time. It does not irritate my sensitive skin, does not feel too greasy, and gives good sun protection.
I was looking for a sunscreen that didn't smell or feel like sun screen (oily/greasy) and this definitely fits the bill. I love this stuff and try to use it everyday for myself and my sons. Feels great on the skin after it's applied and I don't even notice it is there after a few minutes. Highly recommend!!!!
Love this stuff!
I definitely see a difference between this product and the other sunscreens that aren't built for acne-prone skin. I honestly think its doing more than protecting my skin from UV ways. I think it has some acne fighting agents in it. Overall, I recommend it.
I always use this sunscreen for my face. Never caused a breakout like regular oily sunscreen might.
I wanted to love this after a friend recommended it but it burned, so if you have sensitive skin be careful.  I tried to give it a chance so I continued to put it on it leaves kind of a matte finish and after it dried it started flaking around my mouth and nose. Maybe I just got a bad batch but either way I wont be rebuying this.
I bought this awhile ago and I still have it. Definitely worth the money and wait. This is one of my favorite products that I use almost daily
So far, so good. When I first put it on I thought it was going to leave me looking gray but I rubbed it in some more and it was fine. The best part is no breakouts for my acne prone skin!
I bought this to protect my fair skin as I have noticed brown spots appearing on my face now whenever I am out in the sun in the summertime. This went on smoothly, didn't feel greasy, and protected my face without a tacky white residue.
Really nice formula, very kind on my skin and no breakouts. Was a great base under my makeup. My husband who is bald also used this and it saved his head getting burnt and he is usually super sensitive to new products!
This is the first time I tried Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen for Acne-Prone Skin, Broad Spectrum SPF 55 .  I broke out hours after use and realized this was the culprit. My skin routine is simple: Cera Ve face wash, sometimes a toner, no moisturizer in the summer months, and well- no make up during COVID-19.  It wasn't until after two days of use, I realize that this SPF was the culprit. I've spent weeks trying to repair my skin of black heads and zits, and the dark marks left behind.  I may use the rest on my body rather than throw it out--that is if I don't break out.  It also made my face greasy looking.
Very light weight and little to no smell! Love it
I love this sunscreen! I have very sensitive skin and eyes, and this is the only sunscreen I can wear that won't irritate my skin causing me to break out as well as irritate my eyes. I have repurchased this several times.
Excelente
I’ve been using clear face sun block for years and though spf50 May have a bit better protection I will be going back to clear face 35 as it’s lighter and easier to apply but not a deal breaker
The dual protection has been helpful, but this product is ROUGH on the eyes. I didn't actually get it IN my eyes, but I did apply it to the area under my eyebrows and to the bags under my eyes (not to the eyelids). The sunscreen soaked into my skin and a few minutes after application my eyes were burning as badly as if I'd swiped them with a mascara brush.Don't apply anywhere near your eyes and you'll be just fine. Which is kind of annoying since it's a sunscreen for your FACE, but whatever.
Best face sunscreen I have tried so far. I have tried quite a few. And very expensive ones also. This one has worked the best for my probe to acne face. I have never broken out when I use this sun screen. I really recommend it!
I work outside where here it gets very dry hot temperatures and this face cream keeps my face from getting sun burned and it also keep its moisturized.
It is very difficult to find a proper sunscreen for an acne prone teen. This has done well and is a great substitute for Neutrogena "essentials" which is half the size and double the price. It goes on easy and rubs in well. No extra acne breakout to speak of.As far as the Clear Face Liquid Sunscreen is a winner in our experience.

I purchased this product in August of 2014 and now it is January 2015. I've used this product every single day since. My problem is that my face gets tan really easily and it is uneven and just not pleasant. This product has helped me a lot! I now use it every day after applying moisturizer (you could even skip the moisturizer. It is pretty hydrating) without worrying about breakouts. It really is breakout free and it feels very light. There's a reason I use it every day :)
I love this product, I use it when I go on my runs. It is very light and easy to use.
This sunblock compares to the Neutrogena Drytouch products are much lighter. It is very easy to spread. No oily feeling. It is so light that I wonder if I need to put more to achieve the same coverage.  So far so good!
The best sunscreen ever
Felt really powdery on my skin, and it says break out free, but I broke out and got all of these small bumps all over my face after using this. May work for some, but did not work for me.
I originally bought this to wear under my makeup. Sense I purchased this I switched to makeup and primer that both contain sunscreen. I just switched this sunscreen to use on my neck and chest as I live in Florida and ride motorcycles with my husband and our friends. I need sunscreen because I have more mature skin and am trying to avoid wrinkles as long as I can.
Very easy to spread and doesn’t leave any fragrance.
So light - glides onto your skin - no heavy film & absorbs immediately - not a moisturizer though - so you would need to use a moisturizer underneath if your skin is dry or combination - no breakouts using this!

I have very sensitive skin and this is the only brand other than some of the Alba or organic brands that does not make my skin oily or my face break out. It is great and it really lasts. Also doesn't have whatever chemical in it that when you get forehead sweat mixed with sunscreen in your eyes that you think hades has made is permanent home in your corneas (ie no eye burn).
Works really well, doesn't make my skin greasy. I actually replaced my morning lotion with this!
Sunscreen is light and spreads easily. Majority of sunscreen causes my husband breakouts, but this one does not. It's his go-to for year-round sun protection.
I bought this to use every day to protect my skin and am dissapointsd because it leaves my face shiny and oily and sticky. I have to put powder or makeup over it which wastes my time. Not a good everyday sunscreen in my opinion for this reason.It works I Would definitely use on beach and stuff but am disappointed. Feels light on face but is certainly not sheer.
This sunscreen is great ! It doesn’t turn your face white and it blends great with my moisturizer!
Great product. One of the few sunscreens that does not burn my eyes after many hours.
I absolutely love this sunscreen. I use it on my face and neck, and it is the best. Most sunscreens cause my face to feel a burning sensation when I put them on or when I get wet or sweaty after putting them on, but this doesn't make my skin hurt/burn at all. It also feels light on the skin, it isn't cakey or heavy like some sunscreens. I definitely recommend this face sunscreen!
This stuff is great and use it every single day before going out in the Arizona sun. I put it on my face, neck, and ears and then apply Neutrogena liquid foundation on top as part of my makeup routine. I just wash and toner my face at night before bed and I haven't had a breakout in years.
This is the first sunblock that I want to use everyday, even multiple times a day.  It doesn't have that immediate matte feeling, but it soaks in and doesn't look shiny.  It doesn't make my skin sting in any way.  And best of all, NO BREAK OUTS.  No other sunblock has accomplished this!  I put it on at least two times a day, everyday during the summer, and my skin is perfectly clear.  With other sunblocks, I would end up with pimples by day three at the beach, every time.  So glad this product is available!
Great product
Was trying to find a replacement for
Fragrance-free, oil-free, super gentle and amazingly matte. I dare anyone to apply this to their face and try to detect it by sight or touch once it's dry (which is very quick). It truly is as if NOTHING is on your skin, but the protection is there.My dermatologist is always telling me to use a good sunscreen everyday, but where to find one that isn't oily and heavy for my face? I can't wear it if it slides off. What to do? I have been looking for so long, like many, for a non-irritating, non-greasy sunscreen for my face.Finally....Bingo! :)
I bought this because I am very prone to breakouts on my face, and thus have to use adapalene gel at night, before bed. Adapalene makes skin much more sensitive to the sun, so I wanted a non-comedegenic sunscreen that was gentle on my face. It is gentle on my face, and I have never broken out from using it. Recommended for those who have to use prescription-strength acne gels and cremes, like I do.
I purchased this after researching sunscreen products for the face and found this to have my trifecta: high SPF (for my paleness!), matte finish, and non-drying for my sensitive skin. I found it neither dried out or made my face oilier than it should be.It's a non-runny liquid that dried very quickly and was weightless after that, which is perfect for wearing under makeup. This would be great for acne-prone skin, although mine is not.I've been using this for about two months and have not gotten any strange reactions or redness, which I have experienced with other brands. Give it a go!
As the ozone decreases due to our burning of fossil fuels, my face needs proper protection.  This lotion not only helps combat the effects of climate change on my skin, it doesn't feel heavy or greasy or make me break out.  At least my face will look young and healthy all while the inept government refuses to accept that man is causing climate to get worse.
Def in not clear, difficult to rub in. Does great for sun protection just not great for under makeup use
I’m very acne prone and this is my go to for sunscreen for my face, especially for the price
I was a little skeptical at first about getting sunscreen even after reading how good it is to use sunscreen over at skincareaddiction on Reddit because I just don't get enough sun. I ended up getting this because the research says it helps with the acne marks you get from ripping off the pimples and I just have to say my face is getting clearer.I use CeraVe Foaming, CeraVe Moisturizing, Stridex(red box), and Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion SPF 30I am already seeing results and have only been using these product for 2 weeks.
GREAT product! I have extremely sensitive skin and tend to breakout from sunscreen usage in the summer. I used this a few weeks ago on vacation and my skin remained clear. It is a long-lasting lotion that is not too greasy feeling. It's also a reasonable size for the price. I will definitely purchase again.
No breakouts which is a huge plus for me. Not greasy but it sits heavy on the skin. Feels like a product with a lot of silicone ingredients. You can feel and smell it on your skin throughout the day. Not good if you like your skin to have a clean feeling. Doesn't make a good base either. Neutrogena makes great sunscreens but the spf 30 version of this product is better. I'm not sure if the extra spf in this one makes enough of a difference to want to use it.
Love! I’ve been using the Neutrogena face sunscreen for years! Other lotions clog my pores and cause breakouts. This has always worked well for me and never caused breakouts. It’s non-greasy and rubs in nicely. I even put in my hair part on my scalp and it doesn’t flake in my hair.
Works great
Amazing product! Use it everyday and doesn’t break me out. Very lightweight.
This product does protect against UV damage to avoid burns; however, it definitely doesn’t work with a lot of other skincare products. I noticed a lot of pilling when laying on top of serums/moisturizers even when waiting a full 15-30 mins before applying over them. There was also some white cast when using this. If using, I would recommend using minimal products with it.
This stuff saved my skin on 100+ miles of trail in South America. No burns, no breakouts - actually, my super fair, generally finicky skin looked amazing the entire trip. The lotion rubs in well, and has a very mild, pleasant smell. I also found it to be surprisingly moisturizing. Consider me a loyal fan!
Great sun protection. Kind of thick and difficult to spread. Not moisturizing, should use moisturizer before applying.

Finally sunscreen I can use on my face without breaking out!
I had to stop using sun block and sunscreen with high spf (50 plus) a few years ago, as I developed hives.  After that, I only wore sunscreens for sensitive skin.  For some reason, I am not having an allergic reaction to this particular product, even though it is not for sensitive skin.  I like it because it goes on dry, not greasy.  So as long as it keeps working for me and I don't break out in hives, I will continue using.
I used many brand of sunblock lotion before, including the pricy Shiseido sunblock lotion for face. This is the ONLY ONE that doesn't cause any breakout. I love the fact it's a lotion and not cream, so it's more watery than the others but will not leave a streak. I also use it on my arms and legs. It absorts quickly and does not feel sticky at all. Even after I sweat after spending hours outdoors, I don't see any white streak marks as other sunblock lotion will do. I am running low with my first tube and is getting a second one!!!
Always my go-to sunscreen. I've tried so many others and this is the only stuff that doesn't cause breakouts on my face. Also, even after working in the yard in the sun all day I've never had a face sunburn while using this stuff and only applying once in the morning.
Ok I purchased this is the winter to help with my rosacea. I apply it every morning and it has helped clear my complexion a lot. The sunscreen of course is great, but it has helped the most with my dry facial skin and rosacea.
I bought this because it is made not to clog your pores ("Break out free").  Because of that I thought it would be easy on the skin of my face.  Nope. It stings my skin terribly.What's strange is that I usually use Neutrogena's "Sport face" with SPF 70 and it doesn't both my skin a bit. Both the Sport Face and this Clear Face have the "Helioplex" (whatever that is -- a Neutrogena marketing term?), but the chemicals used in "Sport face" do not burn my skin.I now just use this one on my arms and hands because it burns my face so much and go back to using Sports Face. It didn't really clog my pores in the first place but I liked the idea of using something specifically designed not to just in case it did in the future.
A little bit goes a long way. Light. Not sticky or greasy.
I am a tennis player, and I use it before I go out the the courts.  I like it because it stays on my skin, it is fragrance free, and it blends well with my skin.  Excellent product.  Thank you
I love this sunscreen, I was afraid at first because I have acne prone skin, but had no problems at all. Been using it for couple months now and Ill buy again. After applying skin doesnt feel dry or oily, feels soft and looks good.
Covers everything i want in a sunscreen, except it burns when you're exercising. SInce I got this one primarily for exercising, it makes the couple I ordered basically useless to me.
Been using this all summer as my daily face moisturizer and it works wonder. I have sensitive skin and haven’t had any breakouts and my face hasn’t burned, or even gotten super tan. Liquid gold!
I like that it’s very liquid, it’s definitely moisturizing.
I really like this sunscreen. It doesn't feel heavy on the face and didn't cause me to breakout, I have acne prone skin. It also did not cause irritation on my children's sensitive skin and didn't look ghostly on their skin or mine , we are of a tan - deeper complexion. I'd repurchase and recommend this.
I thought it would be manageable but the concentration of essential oil is truly too strong. I have acne prone but not especially sensitive skin, and this definitely burned upon application. I couldn't even put it near my eyes. It was so irritating that it caused an acne flair every time I applied it. Acne went away if I took a break from this product. I wasn't trying any other new product at the time.Weirdly enough, the regular Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Sunscreen Lotion with Broad Spectrum SPF 45 works great. It protects me from the sun and causes minimal breakouts (still a little bit though it's worth protecting my skin). Neutrogena made a bad decision to add SO MUCH cinnamon and ceder extract. This product would probably be outstanding without those additions.
I really like this sunscreen! I actually meant to buy the ultra sheer, but turns out I like this one better! Apparently it has some ingredients that aren't great for you, and it can sting my eyes so I don't use it as an every day sunscreen with my makeup.
A little on the greasy side when first applied, but so far it doesn't cause my skin to breakout. I'll likely buy again.
Feels great in my skin and protects well.
I like the product- it doesn't cause breakouts, doesn't make me feel oily or sticky but it stings. I don't know what ingredient is causing it but it burns whenever I apply it.
Product is easy to spread and rub in, is good for my skin instead of clogging it up, and it is so nice to not have to decide between pink skin and pimples.
I love this, very nice texture, very good work with all creams, not makes any problem, very light. I liked!
Bought for a trip. I didn't ger burnt, it didn't clog my pores either. I liked how it wore on my oliy skin better than the day cream I'd been using. So I've been using this instead.
I was so so excited about this sun screen. I rubs into the skin so smoothly and felt so nice on my skin. After applying it felt nice and light weight. At the end of the day I started to feel a little itchy on my face and noticed some red bumps forming. I washed off my face and when I woke up in the morning this rash was all over my face most on my chin, neck and around my eyes. It’s a burning hot rash. Funny enough a video that came up on my phone today was warning people not to use this sun screen. So I 10/10 DO NOT recommend.
Easy to use and I’m glad to know it protects me too
I have oily skin and these is the only sun protection that won’t make my face breakthrough..
This is the only drugstore sunscreen I've found that doesn't make my face break out. I think I'm really sensitive to whatever it is they put in sunscreen because usually within hours after applying, I usually have several whiteheads pop up out of nowhere. I'm many years past adolescence and this is the only time that happens. This is the only sunscreen I've found (besides BareMinerals sunscreen powder) that doesn't cause these spontaneous breakouts.
This is product amazing. I've struggled with terrible acne due to my really dry skin for years. I tried different products, face washes, and spent way too much on dermatology visits for crap that didn't work. I gave this sunscreen a shot, and it has worked wonders. I use it twice a day, and I have the occasional pimple like once a month now, mostly because I'll forget to apply it for a couple of days. I can't promote this product more.
It did leave a slight white cast but not too much and goes on very well.
I was looking forward to receiving this product for a while now, I read through the reviews and thought I’d give it a try because neutrogena products usually satisfy me. But this was definitely not it... this sunscreen seems liquidy at first but just does not absorb fully. It leaves my skin flakey in the matter of 20 seconds (even if I’m extremely moisturized) FLAKES of sunscreen all over my face and hair. Very disappointed, this is low quality sunscreen for sure. Writing this just for a heads up to any of you
Just came back on vacation.. I have very sensitive skin and needed a face sunscreen.. I did not breakout!!!! .. you must rub in the cream well so you don’t get a white cast.. so have I found this product.. it protected my skin perfectly
This is not greasy and does not make my skin break out. Has prevented dark spots. Great with dusting of powder.
I really like this product because it doesn't go on oily!
Cheaper than store by half price!Works greatIs it bit a runnier than other nuetrogena sunblocks which is great for rubbing in the face so it doesn’t take so long and can wear under face powderHelioplex does shimmer but gives a Dewey look and isn’t greasy
My skin breaks out very easily, this product does not leave my with clogged pores by the end of the day like other sunscreens I have tried. I can't stand the feel of greasy sunscreen, especially if I'm going to use makeup over it.  This is lightweight and not oily at all.  I'm outside in high altitude and have yet to burn while using this.
I have sensitive, freckled skin, and I love this stuff. Goes on easy, is clear nearly immediately, absorbs quickly and is effective for sun protection. I’ve had zero issues with it irritating my skin.
Sunscreen works extremely well. The bottle does not seem large but is lasting a very long time. Very smooth, drys quickly and does not even feel like you have sunscreen on. I also have a lot of problems with ache and oily skin but this product did not cause me to break out at all. Perfect. I will most defiantly buy more when I run out.
Protective and absorbs well. Gives you dewy look-I'd imagine this is good for any skin tone/color since it doesn't leave a whitish cast that makes you look like a ghost.Can wear under makeup.
I bought this for my brother...he said he didn’t like the consistency of the product.
i think this does a good job of protecting my face from the sun. it does leave an oily finish but that's okay with me because i use a pressed powder to mattify my face. it didn't cause me to break out which is good because my face is acne prone. there's no scent; i like how it doesn't smell like a sunblock. i will buy this product again.
A bit Runny out of the bottle but applies and works as well as any other without any issues and it has never burned my eyes in the pool or when sweating like other brands.
This seems to work well enough. My face hasn't sunburned, and I haven't gotten any clogged pores/zits from using it. It's not as greasy as other face sunscreens I've used.
Great lotion but unfortunately does not dry on my face as well as the liquid. I tried both at the same time and I just liked the liquid better for my needs. But this was a great lotion, didn't clog my pores at all!
This is my first time using this and it seems to work great. I was getting break outs using regular sunscreen on my face. This is perfect makes my skin soft and moisturized without being to greasy. Defiantly Recommend!
My other sunscreen was making me breakout, so i decided to give this one a try. I haven’t broken out or gotten sunburn since, so I’d say that’s a win!!
Great stuff!  Soaks right into your face and does not cause breakouts.  I use this every day.  Light but pleasant smell.Only thing that can be improved is the slightly-chalking texture.  I don't notice this at all on my face, just on my hands after application.
Love this stuff, I have been searching for a durable sunscreen that I could use everyday without breaking out and this does just the trick. I use it everyday in conjunction with my lancome moisturizer and I have not had any issue with breakouts. I don't have any issue combining it with my moisturizer and I would definitely recommend.

oh this is a good facial sunscreen, it barely causes any dryness which is impressive
I bought this for a trip to the DR and because with most sunscreens I get awful breakouts and my skin is already sensitive to sunlight. I wore this everyday for seven days and didn’t get any breakouts didn’t feel greasy on my face at all.
Works wonderful on my brown skin, I use it to help prevent more dark marks on my face and it works very well in protecting my skin. I mix it with aloe vera gel & tea tree oil when I apply as my daily moisturizer
goesnon easy and even, stays in place, dosent irritate my skin.

Headline says it all. I have super sensitive skin. I was in the Carribean in the sun daily. No problems here! I don't know if it is moisturizing or not I use my own.

This product is exactly what I was looking for, but I got one bottle of sunscreen. Not 3, as advertised in the title of the product. I'm not surprised, because a pack of 3 for $8 sounded too good to be true, but I'm also confused as to why the title of the product is so misleading.
My son has slightly sensitive skin and this product did not effect him at all and worked so very well!!Great quality and value
It seems really nice so far and doesn’t break me out. Good sunscreen.
Keeps my forehead from getting burnt without causing a bunch of acne. Works great!
Truly light feel and didn't break me out. Will purchase again.
Love this product!
This is fantastic sunscreen. It doesn't smell strong doesn't feel sticky and protects extremely well against the sun. I've used this at the beach and on long bike rides and sweat nor sea water stopped this sunscreen from keeping me burned. I absolutely love this product and their body sunscreen is well worth it too.
I've been using this sunscreen for yrs. It's affordable and it's not too sticky if you live in Northern California. But I recently realized, this sunscreen is very oily and sticky if you go to any humid places. Also it used to be a lot cheaper than this. They are keep raising the price! I like it but I wouldn't say this is the best.
It’s Neutrogena. Reasonably price for what you get. It’s oil free
This may sound strange but it almost felt like this product actually reduced my acne! I instantly breakout when I’m in the sun without sunscreen for as little as 20 minutes. Most sunscreens I’ve tried make my face feel oily and cause break outs
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
I was hoping this would provide a little bit more moisturizer... works okay if I put this on first, wait for it to dry a little, then put on another layer of my actual moisturizer, but since I have no idea if that negates the effect of the sun protection I have switched to something else, but will still use this occasionally so I don't waste it. Won't buy again though.
I have used this sunscreen for some time with good results.  However, whoever mailed the latest order to me sent an open tube in the mailing envelope.  The result when I reached into the envelope to retrieve the 2 tubes was nearly 1/3 of a tube squeezed out in the envelope and a hand covered in lotion.  What a mess! The problem is not the sunscreen, the problem is with whoever fulfilled the order.
I use it every morning and have for years. It is great sun protection and moisturizes all day.  I will be buying it again soon as summer is here and I apply it more often.
I tried this after seeing tons of recommendations and positive reviews. It turns out that was a mistake. Only after I had problems did I find the other side of the story - people like me with severe eye and skin irritation who never reacted to other skincare products.My eyes and eyelids burned for several minutes every time I used this sunscreen. I should've stopped using it immediately, but stupidly, I didn't, thinking I just needed to get used to it. Within a week I had red, scaly, flaking, raised patches on my eyelids. My entire face stung like it was chapped or had a chemical burn, and my skin began peeling off in dime-sized patches. I stopped using the sunscreen and my face cleared up and went back to normal within three days.I have almost no contact allergies and had only reacted badly to one cosmetic product prior to this. My skin is the opposite of sensitive - it's so unlikely that I'll have a problem with anything that I don't even patch test. I guess I learned my lesson. Now I have a huge bottle of liquid pain and wasted money sitting in my bathroom, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
My favorite sunscreen, feels like you aren't wearing any, but then you don't get burned!  I never break out with this sunscreen, and most others cause my acne to flair.  Lasts a long time, and doesn't wash off quickly when you swim
Can’t leave home without this sun protection, absolutely love it 😻, does not leave any white residuals
Throwing out two bottles of this sunscreen because the label states that it contains octocrylene. I am switching to only mineral-based sunscreens now."Researchers asked U.S. regulators to pull some sunscreens from the market, including brands such as Coppertone, Banana Boat and Neutrogena, saying they’ve found evidence of a potential carcinogen. Scientists petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to remove from sale all sunscreens containing the active ingredient octocrylene. Products made with the chemical may contain benzophenone, a suspected carcinogen that also can interfere with key hormones and reproductive organs, according to a group." - Bloomberg
Terrible product
perfect for my skin type! no more zits. it isn't shiny and greasy.
Translate review to English
use on my face - easy to apply - no mess - works well - I spend hours in the sun, never burned when using this
Easy on easy off with soap. Seem to stay on during hours of yard work. Great 55 for face
Love this! Only thing I’ve used where I get no breakouts!
I wanted to like this product however after trying several different methods this has got to go.No matter what order I use this in in relation to my other skin care- it clumps and comes off. It leaves a peeling flaking appearance to my skin. So gross and no way to get rid of it once it’s there. So disappointed.
The only sunscreen I'll ever use on my face. Instantly disappears, no greasy feel, no shine, no fragrance, no residue. Most important, it protects really well and doesn't remotely aggravate my breakout-prone skin.
Doesn’t make me break out. Goes on white, but the ghostly hue disappears without a few minutes. I don’t get much sun exposure, but I’m extra cautious because I have rosacea. A little goes a long way.
not oily easy to put on not so thick!
Very happy with this.  I've been in the sun a great deal.  Besides knowing I have the UV protection; it really has kept my face from burning.  I apply it generously and have not had a single outbreak or any sensitivity issues.
This product is amazing, very light, non greasy, zero pimples, not brightness in my face, I use every day with no damage.
I researched a whole lot about sunscreens before buying this and I'm so glad I found this!! I have brown normal skin and this sunscreen doesn't cause any break out or leave the dreaded white cast! I went to India for a wedding  for 2 weeks and wore this sunscreren everyday and when I got back everyone said I hadn't tanned at all!!I'm in love with this!
Unlike some other oil free, non comedogenic products, this proved to be effective as my skin complexion has been upholding well in sun exposure as well as intense perspiration in 110 degree plus desert heat.  Does not run into eyes and irritate unless direct or accidental application is placed in the eyes (not including skin around eyes, that worked fine with moderate sweating).
This stuff looks great on - it has a velvety matte finish that works kind of like a primer. And it has great spf coverage. The problem is that there are very irritating ingredients in the product, including - of all things - cinnamon, which does nothing useful and burns like crazy on exfoliated skin. If you're on a retin-A or other skin thinning regimen, I'd recommend against this product because of the sting.
I have a oily skin and this sunblock supposed won't cause breakouts. Not my case. I have been using it for 2 weeks now. Just to see if it was my skincare routine I completely stop using my products just the sunscreen and still very very oily and a lot shine. Looks and feels greasy
I use this under my foundation. It works as a great primer. It is not oily or over sticky, does not give a white cast. It’s perfect. The price on amazon is great!
I bought this for the good reviews and because I wanted a sunscreen that wouldn't make me breakout. It did on my face, but I also used it on my neck and chest. That was the biggest mistake. My neck and chest have a 'rash' of acne that I'm trying to clear up. I had no idea something a product like this would do that to neck and chest, let alone my face!
I liked the oil free 50SPF face moisturizer option from Great Value better. This one breaks me out and does not protect from the sun like a 50SPF should.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
I have oily and acne-prone skin. Enough to have breakouts every time I use sunscreen and this product did not make it for me. I used it one day and totally regret it the next day. Gave it another chance two days in a row, and now I'm dealing with the consequences.Just to clarify, I thoroughly clean my face every day. I know what my skin likes and whatnot. I know how my face reacts to almost every single organic and chemical product out there and I sincerely do not recommend this product.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Good product i liked it.
Really is very light.  I don't know I have it on.  My face doesn't feel slimy, and it doesn't cause that tingly feeling for me that some sunscreens do.  First one I've found that I would be willing to wear every day!I am NOT a paid reviewer and did not receive a discount/free product for this review.
I have a very sensitive face to sun screen, but this stuff is great! It doesn’t burn when I put it on, easy to smooth in, and keeps me from getting burnt!
Easy to spread. First sunscreen didn’t cause my skin to breakout.
Im not sure what it is in this but it burns for the first 20 to30 min you put this on. Ive tried it 3 times b/c i thought i might have over exfoliated the first time i put it on but nope. It just burns. My skin is peeling and flaky with just 3 uses.
I have mix skin (oily in the T zone) and pro-acne skin. This is the only sunscreen that hasn't broken my skin out.I, personally, do not apply a whole lot, just few drops it's more than enough.The consistency is light and it leave you with a matte finish look.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
Fine sunscreen.  All sunscreens are oily, but this one isn't near as bad as most.  And with others, I'd have a few blemishes a few days later.  Not with this one.  Fairly light, for a sunscreen, and weak (which is good), pleasant smell.  Seems to perform well; no sunburns yet.  A little pricey, but worth the benefits.  Very satisfied.
Excellent quality, this is the only sunscreen that offers high protection, a light texture that penetrates the skin without leaving a white sheen and that doesn't make my skin break out!If only I didn't have to buy it from the US each time it would be perfect.
I like it but isn’t it supposed to have a seal on it before use? No seal.
My mom and I both love this product! We have sensitive skin, and I usually have minor breakouts when wearing sunscreen (but sunburn is always worse!). Pleasantly surprised with this purchase and would definitely recommend to others with sensitive skin.
Great for sensitive faces other sunscreens feel thick on my face this one absorbs well and feels light. I also didn't break out in acne after using.
I like this product because it’s full protection for my face, I’m a beach person and it really works!
Bought for a quick trip to Cabo and liked this one a lot. The selection on Amazon was so much better than the drugstore and i really like this one.
I love this sunscreen! I put it on after my moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling matte
I use this every day in the summer, great finish and keeps the sun off your face. Normally goes for at least $13 in stores, great deal. No breakouts!
Got this specifically because of its rating on EWG, and loved how non greasy it felt and how easily it blended in on top of my moisturizer, and I love other Neutrogena products, so I am really disappointed.I broke out in an itchy rash all over my cheeks and decolletage. It also created a burning sensation afterward, like a chemical burn. I still have the bumps all over my chest even though I stopped using it three days ago and my cheeks are still tender. This marked the third time I tried to use it (I thought maybe it was something else, since this is specifically advertised to not cause breakouts).I don't have sensitive skin, I keep my skin well moisturized, and my body well hydrated (I've heard of people having issues with even "clean" products if their bodies aren't hydrated).
This is gonna be one of those that either works for you or it doesn’t. My mom loves it, and I did too, until I noticed that it pills horribly on me. Makes your skin look very nice though. If you don’t wear makeup and don’t touch your face, it’s awesome.
We hate sunscreen that leaves that dulling layer that makes our beautiful, brown, glowing skin sad and ashy. Well, you've found the answer! This product works well, smells okay, NOT sweat proof, but it drys completely clear. Yay!
Great non-greasy sunscreen for the face that absorbs quickly.  Perfect if you have oily skin or acne, or simply don’t like the way a lot of sunscreens feel on your face.
Great protection and it doesnt dry my skin or make me breakout. Does sting if you make contact with the eye area. Overall I'm happy with this, it is better than I expected from a drugstore brand.
I use this everyday. It doesn’t leave a white cast, but it will make your skin shine a bit. I use a translucent powder over it and it’s perfect.
Nice and light and non-greasy. Seems to work well and I like the clear formula that seems to soak in quickly.
Though I am not allergic and had used so many different products, this one burns my skin.
My husband and I both like this product. It is not sticky and does the job! I freckle easily so I need a good sunscreen. This one works.
I really like that this doesn’t leave my skin feeling greasy. It’s very light (runny) and blends in well, doesn’t leave white marks. I’m prone to breaking out but this hasn’t caused any acne. Will be purchasing again once I run out
I have used this for almost every single day for about 18 months. I am about to buy a 3rd or 4th bottle.  No break outs. The SPF really works in the sun. This does not leave my skin oily or greasy.
I love it usually sunscreens feel greasy to me but this one doesn’t feel greasy at all
This is finally the product, that is also affordable, that doesn't cause my face to breakout after sweating and being in the sun. It's very lightweight as well. Would highly recommend.
We live in Florida, we use this EVERYDAY.
simply put the best for face protection
I have always trusted Neutrogena for sunscreen, however, this a face sunscreen that will burn your eyes terribly with sweat or getting in water. Not at all what I would expect from this company.
This is just as advertised!  I use it daily and often reapply.  Not greasy and no acne.I had a similar sunscreen (same brand, not Clear Face) and daily use contributed to acne.
Feels great going on and goes on quite easily!
Great stuff! Not greasy, can be mixed with non spf foundation
Great lightweight moisturizer that can be used for everyday use. I’ve been using this product for 3 years now and I’ve never had a problem.
love it live it
Loved this, but stung my eyes
Not greasy at all. Does not smell like sunscreen on your face. I have sensitive skin and this does not break me out.  I use it every day.
Best item ever.....easy to apply.  Great under makeup........no sunburn anywhere.... not even on my hands and ears!  Recommended years ago by my dermatologist to ALL her patients!!  Awesome and great as advertised...........SUN PROTECTION  IS AWESOME.
For a product that advertises clear skin, it actually does the opposite and I am very dissatisfied.  Product has a nice consistency, but like other reviews mentioned it created a whole bunch of white spots on my face after using.  I'll stick with something like Eucerin face lotion that's a little heavy, or Clean&Clear dual action for when I don't need the SPF.
excelente
I don't know why I thought this was a moisturizer too, it's not.  It's just straight sunblock.  That being said, it works well, not greasy, no acne outbreaks, and it's easy to apply.  It's just not what I needed.
Works great and doesn't feel heavy on your skin
I'm a greaseball which is gonna pay when I get older but I am tired tired tired of alternately slimey or too dry irritating sunscreen. Excellent for mineral makeup as it's dry and actually collects your T-zone oil all day long. In conjunction with clinical stress Secret your anxious, greasy self might be able to hide the outward appearance of fear, nervousness and sweating. Another lifechanger that my skin will thank me for later.
It might do property what is supposed to do, however, even if you are careful with your eyes, you eventually gonna touch it during the day and is gonna burn as hell. Because of that I not gonna buy again and will return to my regular Neutrogena
I like this sunscreen because it dries matte on my face and isn't oily. It also doesn't break my face out like most sunscreens. My only concern is that it's quite runny. I'm not sure if this is because I bought it from an independent seller or they've changed the formula. I will probably be buying from the drug store next time.
This product definitely was useful for sun burn but if you have acne and reapply after getting out of the water it burns a little
It feels light and smooth on my skin, doesn't leave white residue, and doesn't make me break out as far as I can tell. Been using it for about two years now, and still happy with it! Way better than the Ultra-Sheer Dry Touch.
I liked this product quality and goes in the skin well
Works wonderfully
This is great sun converge and it's not greasy or heavy. I use this over two other products and it works perfectly. My skin can get really oily with some products and this product doesn't clog my pores or make it extra greasy.
Thanks till my next purchase !
excelent for prone and mix skin
Needed sunscreen for kids that wouldn't cause breakouts and this works great!  Other sunscreens caused horrible acne for both my kids and this just doesn't.
Not for oily skin
I may have read the description wrong.?? Here is the description. (Neutrogena Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid-Lotion Sunscreen SPF 55 3 oz (Pack Of 3) ) It says pack of 3. I only got 1. Either I read it wrong or the description really stinks.
This product is amazing. If doesn't weight in your skin like others. It's light and it doesn't have a strong smell. Will keep up with this brand.
I have adult acne and I am very picky on choosing things on my skin. This sun block is affordable and works on my skin.
A great dupe for high end sunscreens. Simple, light, mixes easily with makeup.
This is the second time that I purchased this product. No skin break-outs or rash. Works for me!
Tingled a little bit but didn't break me out and felt very moisturizing!
Great product! Does not cause us to break out either!  My husband also uses this on his sensitive bald head and works very well.
I have skin that is oily and easily breaks out so I hate to put anything on my face. I have applied this many times with no break outs. Also, I have a few spots that darken easily but as long as I use this, the spots have not gotten darker.
Item came exactly as described and shown.
I have slightly oily, blemish-prone skin. I love this sunscreen so much. It has never caused ANY breakouts for me. It goes on a bit heavy, but it dries quickly into my skin. In the summer, I don't even need to use a moisturizer in the morning with this. I actually use sunscreen every day now! Very happy with this product.
The only high SPF that doesnt break me out. Not greasy.But it isn't pack of 3. You only get 1. Makes sense for the price.
Doesn’t feel greasy or make me break out and it’s not as bad and chemical filled as a lot of sun care items.
Thicker than expected.
Every time I apply this I get more acne than usual. I am afraid to use it on my face now. I just apply it on my arm :(
Was hard to spread and worsened my acne. Good for the body tho.
smells and feel really good, light
Clean and Clear.  I wear sunscreen everyday and sometimes it blocks up my pores.  They is light, smooth and keeps me away from the damaging rays.  I love Neutrogena sunscreens.
I have sensitive skin and I didn't break out.  It does not feel heavy on my face. I've been wearing it over my moisturizer and under my makeup.  It does the job.
Excellent (according to my wife)
The best sunscreen ever ❤️
It evaporates into the skin quickly leaving no white residue. I will probably re-order.
2 of my family members have very sensitive skin & break out very easily. We used this all summer with no problems!
This is the ONLY sunscreen that doesn’t make me break out like a greasy teenager!  💗
Does feel clear on the skin.  It can run down your face and get into your eyes like other sunscreens.
This is a non irritating, dry finish chemical sunscreen that does dry to a true matte finish instead of the odd greasy-dry feeling of some "dry touch" sunscreens. It has almost no odor and dries clear. My new favorite! I'll try the higher SPF variant for next summer.
I absolutely love this sunscreen! It goes on nicely and I can layer it on and reapply later easily. My only wish is that it was dry-touch.
It’s a good sunscreen. Definitely worth the price
Great sunscreen for my face
I have reached the sunscreen quickly .. Excellent I love it very light on the face is greasy .. A successful experience of oily skin with a very good degree of protection
Great product, easy to spread, no residue, blocks the sun, not greasy. My favorite sunscreen by a mile
I wear this daily as a facial sunscreen, and I have never had a breakout, nor do I look greasy.  I also get my ID checked regularly when buying alcohol, and I am several decades older than 21.  I think this stuff takes part of the credit for my endlessly youthful appearance.
Neutrogena never disappoints. I love the brand.
Leaves like an oily residue after applying it, but besides of that its great
I typically can't stand putting sunscreen lotion on my face because I'm prone to breakout. this wasn't so bad!
Worked great in Naples FL.  Performed swimming and protection lasted.No blocked skin pours after using.
This is the PERFECT facial sunscreen, it’s non oily like it says, a little can do a lot, and so far it’s working great!
Burned my skin a little bit
I used this every day for a week and still had some small breakouts but considering what it could have been like with another brand/product, I'm happy with it.
I love this product. I use it under my makeup every day. It is sheer and not greasy and it doesn't give me any breakouts. Plus the price is good.Nothing I don't like.
Acne prone skin here! I am always terrified to put sunscreen on my face, not anymore! This is really thin and seriously doesn't make me break out at all. I kept waiting for it to happen and it never did!!
I like this sunblock because it isn't thick or greasy. It is perfect to use under makeup or as a mix in to foundation. It absorbs very quickly and doesn't have a fragrance. I would recommend this to people who want a face sunblock. I would even use this on my body since it isn't greasy and won't get all over your clothes.
very effective, spread evenly and does not break me out
No sun burn at all. This stuff does not get in your eyes. It's a very light / non greasy formula. Will be my go to  face lotion sunscreen from now on. Does not feel like traditional sun screen
Use it everyday and it's thick at first application but absorbs very quickly. I wear my foundation over it and it doesn't make my face oily. Will purchase again
Other sunblocks irritate my face.  This one is perfect for the Colorado high altitude sun, cold and wind.  Wouldn't go without it.
Translate review to English
Love this sunscreen!! It give the protection you want without the oily sticky feel of normal sunscreen. It feels like putting on a regular lotion. I never worry about breakouts with this suncreen like I do with others.
I break out really easily and haven't had any issues with this product. It doesnt have a greasy feeling and no strong scent.
Love this sunscreen! I have insanely sensitive skin and this product doesn't cause any problems at all. It goes on easily, absorbs quickly, and is not the least bit greasy.
The only sunscreen that doesn’t break me out. I use acne.org and it’s reccomended my the maker of acne.org. Literally you can’t go wrong with this even my dermatologist said 50spf is a great buy.
I always used this product and I highly recommend
I have highly sensitive, easy-to-burn skin. I've tried a lot of products. This one is great. The consistency is a little runny, but it is not sticky, heavy or smelly. It does a great job protecting me from the sun and I don't even know I have it on.
It feels stingy and burns my skin. It did come unsealed so I'm not even sure if this is an original product. Not to waste it, I won't be using this on my face.
This stuff is great! Not oily at all and has kept my face the same shade for most of vacation. We bought another brand for our bodies and ended up burnt to a crisp everywhere but our face/neck. Highly recommend!
I used this for three weeks in Jamaica while trying to heal some bad forehead acne. I had a lot of scars and a bunch of huge bad under skin pimples. I did not break out once using this product, and it kept my acne safe from the suns rays burning scars into my head.
Works as intended, can’t complain about this sunscreen. It provides sun protection without the usual pore clogging
Good light sunscreen. I keep it in my purse at all times. Neutrogena stuff is the best. Non greasy and effective.
Great sunscreen and is not oily at all. Does not make your face have a sheen to it and also does not make me breakout
Love it!
Hard to find until last year, easy to find here on Amazon.  This is the only one that works for my skin.
It didn’t have a tamper seal on it. Is that ok?
My derm suggested I switch from the popular, less expensive suntan lotions to Neutrogena. I love the sun, but was looking for a way to protect my face, neck, upper chest and back without breaking out. WINNING PRODUCT! The breakouts have stopped. Stocking up on this product for my face and using another brand for body...
Since I hit my 30's I've had issues with breakouts and I have to be very careful with what products I use on my face. I have tried many facial sunscreens bad this is my current favorite.  It's lightweight and wears well under my makeup. The best part is that it doesn't cause my face to breakout any more. Great find!
Overall, I liked this okay.  It didn't cause me to breakout, but I wasn't crazy about the texture of it after it was on.  It looked and felt somewhat greasy.  It definitely protected, but would probably be better for someone that had drier skin in general.
It is a good product!
Perfect even for oily skin.  Goes on smoothly and does not have an oily feeling. Love this product!
The issue is a dermatologist does not recommend the ingredients
use this every day, will have to get another one very soon
This thing really works. I had trouble with acne and it disappeared once i started using it.
My kid and all their fellow lifeguards swear by this sunscreen because it works without causing them to break out.
This face sunscreen is the best. Didn’t feel oily/greasy at all. Great coverage; not one burn all summer.
Ok
This is my go to for sun protection. I love it.
It’s an ok sunscreen but it’s too sticky for me and I think there is better out there. Will keep it to use for my son but wouldn’t buy it again.
I usually don't do bad reviews unless the product has dangerous results. I bough it because I trusted Neutrogena brand. The very first time I used it it burned bad in my cheeks (burn and pain). I washed my face right away and didn't use it again. Next day I had dark spots in my face. 2 days later my face was flaky. I have discoloration in both cheeks and I really don't know what to do to get rid of the damage.I don't recommend this product.
It takes some time for you to evenly distribute the product and left a tingling sensation on my skin after application. But the good thing is that I have acne prone skin and it hasn’t caused me to breakout.
Well.. the product works just fine...totally satisfied
This is wonderful suncreen.  It really does go on clear, doesn't feel gooey or heavy on your face, and doesn't accentuate your wrinkles.  A winner for  a reasonable price.
Love
A little expensive, but does the job well for protecting my face from getting burned.Does not leave a greasy feeling on your face
I am battling enlarged pores and sun damage on my almost 40 year old skin. This sunscreen keeps me from looking like a greasy mess while protecting my skin
Like the SPF #....also, a little bit of lotion goes a long way. Feel Neutrogena is a trustworthy brand!
Good price for a product like this work pretty well .
I use this everyday before I put on makeup, it's light and breathable feeling. Not to thick or heavy on my skin, i have sensitive skin and it doesn't  irritate my skin either. I give this an A+
It was too thick and greasy for my taste, and it made my skin burn.  Granted, I use tretinoin cream at night, so my skin is a bit sensitive.  I wouldn't use it for a daily sunscreen, but it would be fine for the beach.
Horrible experience. I had to run to emergency care since I had red rashes all over my neck. I initially thought it was just a coincidence and I gave it a try again. I had the exact same reaction :(The doctor confirmed that it is because of this product. He also mentioned that avobenzone and oxybenzone is not suitable to all skin types.I called in Neutrogena helpline and they were not even ready to listen in.
My go to sunscreen, been wearing this for years now. I live in SoCal and sunscreen is crucial everyday, This does not break me out whatsoever and it's light and breathable.
Doesn’t for sensitive skin, got breakout 😭
I have very sensitive skin, this product is so easy to spread and no break-outs after. Already 2 weeks using it.
Great product! I use this after my serum then my ti ted moisturizer. It is not heavy or greasy!
I wear sunscreen with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide when I'm going to be in the sun more than just a quick jaunt to and from work. But, on office days, I wear this chemical sunscreen under my makeup. This is the least expensive sunscreen I've found that doesn't eventually give me a shiny face.
I don't think this is a true product. My face is burning and now swollen. What the hell is in this!
Does not disappoint. Re=apply as directed and you will not get a sunburn. Washes off easily too
Perfect
I bought a tube of this for a three week trip to Indonesia and it worked great. I have sensitive skin and had no trouble. 90 and sunny every day on the equator!
This product didn't work well on my face. It made my sensitive skin act up a little and my skin look oily/shiny. I still use the product daily on my neck and chest and it works great as a sunscreen! Just not for my face as I'd hoped.
Really non greasy. I will be buying again. Has a slight sting when applied, but it goes away quickly. Have not noticed any breakouts.
Grear product
Does a great job of preventing sunburn and doesn't cause skin irritation or acne after use.  However, like all sunscreens, it burns like hell if you get it in your eyes.  Would recommend.
The bottle was very discolored.. it doesn't look like anything leaked in the package. After scrubbing it with an alcohol swab, a dark brown color started to come off. I will be returning this, I don't know what is covering this bottle.
I have highly sensitive skin and my skin didn't break out which is a plus. That and I am usually picky about what I put on my face, good product.
good but made me break out. but most stuff does
I have found that Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 55 provides adequate sun protection while minimizing acne breakouts due to SPF sensitivity.
Used the 30spf version last summer, but now that I've moved to a sunnier climate, I've switched to the 50spf version. Goes on just as quickly, blends down to an invisible finish, stays dry all day without chalkiness or pulling on my fair skin. No greasy shine during day for me.
This is my go-to sunscreen
I use this every year on my face as I usually always break out from oils in sun lotion.  When I use this one, that doesn’t happen
This sunscreen protects without feeling greasy and thick. It is fragrance free so good for people with allergies to perfumes.
This sunblock works, sort of. It is SPF 30, but I feel like it is closer to an SPF 15. It didn't seem like it provided great coverage. I burned fairly easily with this sunblock. Additionally, the lotion is a bit drying. It doesn't add any moisture to your face. My face tends to be dry since I use acne medicine, and this doesn't do anything to moisturize. It did not reduce my acne, though I don't think it increased it either. Its smell is mild, which is good. I used this because it was all I had on me, but I use other lotions before this if they are around.
Great coverage without having to reapply often. My teenager's loved how it did not break out their skin.
Burns my eyes throughout the day but doesn't leave a white cast
Great sunblock
Lovr
I don't have bad adult acne, but I do have triggers (some random, some predictable). It seems using this triggers little ones. Not horrible, but I was looking for something that didn't cause any blemishes. I can use it one day and be fine, but 2 in a row and I'm guaranteed to see unwanted results. I tried an Aveeno product with the same results. I'm now trying an Olay sensitive skin product to see if that's any better.
I like this product
Smells great and doesnt feel greasy, protects as it should and doesn't clogs your skin.
A great product great price
Amazing for acne prone, oily skin.
This product feels very light on my face.
Nothing much to say it’s Neutrogena very good product very good company works well
I like how it goes on my skin, BUT it caused my skin to be itchy after a few applications. While regular more heavy sunscreens don't cause that issue to me.
Great face sunscreen! I have sensitive alin and usually end up with heat rash or breaking out and I did not afer using this on spring break.
When I use this in the morning before heading outside this sunblock works amazing and doesn't make me break out at all, which I love.  However if I need to reapply while I'm out at the pool it irritates the skin horribly and burns when I apply it.  As an everyday usage it works fantastic though, I just do not recommend for sensitive skin for thorough usage outside.
I love this sunscreen! I've worn it while kayaking and while doing everyday things, and it has prevented sunburn and doesn't contribute to breakouts. It doesn't feel overly oily and has a pleasant smell.
It does not feel greasy at all!  Its a nice feeling on your face and provides excellent protection.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
It’s the first time that I used , but it’s really good product
Perfect
I use this for my whole body as I have sensitive skin. My skin loves this sunblock and doesn't break out.
I have used this daily for five years.  I'll never use another kind.  I never get a sunburn and it feels just like lotion.  There is no greasiness to it.
It burns your eyes when you get it in the water. Make sure you wait 30-45 minutes before getting in the water
I wear it every day under my makeup and have had no issues with breakouts. It dries pretty quickly and isn't oily. Just don't get it near your eyes or it burns. But I love this stuff!
Not greasy under makeup. Wish it came in higher spf
As someone with oily skin, this is the only sunscreen I've tried that doesn't make my face feel disgusting after putting it on, worth it
Really nice for an oily skin and protecting your face from burn or just protecting from sun.
It works alright.
Love the item! But, you have to reapply after going into the water. Really nice and affordable.
Excellent product! Protects my fair, oily, sensitive skin from photoaging very, very well! I have used this for 3-4 years now, I am 51 & still look like I am in my 40's. I owe it ALL to Neutrogena's Clear Face Sunblock & their other sunblocks as well!
I have tried many brands but this one is better than most of them.When you put, It may feel powdery at first but in couple of seconds it feels like as nothing was there in the first place.
For whatever reason this sunscreen helps prevent the excessive oil buildup on my face. I think its unintended, but its pretty great
Loved this sunblock! Used it throughout southeast Asia and didn't get burned at all - despite being outside all day. It didn't make me breakout and didn't have the weird odor that so many sunblocks have. I didn't even just use it on my face - since it was so effective and non-greasy, I used it everywhere. Love it.
My wife loves this product. Best product in the market
loved the product as i have oily skin and dont like having my face oily, recommend it!
I love this sunscreen, it doesn't irritate my skin or my eyes like others do. I wear it daily and like how it is lightweight.
This product works well for everyday sun protection.  It is not to greasy and doesn't cause breakouts.
For me that the best I love it my face really changes after I use it
Best facial sunscreen I've EVER used. Doesn't leave any signs of itself. No sunburn. Wonderful.
Great product, works great on my kids, no rash, lightweight, always have it on hand. Does not cause breakouts either, highly recommend.
Love this, it doesn't leave a big oily residue like other sunscreens and doesn't cause breakouts after a long day in the sun
Haven't had any breakout since I started using this! Very light and does not leave skin oily or shiny. Highly recommended
This sunscreen prevents acne scars from swelling. A must
Works great. I was breaking out from using other sunscreens and now I’m not!!!
A bit heavy on the skin, but great protection from aging.
I have been looking for a sun block like this for some time. Shiseido has a similar sun block but it is $30 per ounce. Goes on like a liquid but is not oily like other products. Dries to a nice matte finish. Not sure how effective it is blocking sun yet but at least it looks good once it is on.
Lightweight.
Non greasy non clumpy and great for everyday wear.
My skin loved it
Love love love! I have skin that likes to break out and this works perfectly for me. No breakouts and no sunburns!
This lotion applies very white. I bought it for daily use but the color stays on top of my skin instead of blending in. It causes my makeup to look cakey and the wrong color. Now, I only use this before going out where there is a lot of sun. It is way too thick to wear for everyday use.
Doesn’t feel greasy when you apply it. Drys matte. Doesn’t have a white cast in flash photography. Hasn’t broken me out yet. Good sunscreen
I have really oily skin. Don't get have acne or pimples though. I wanted something that wouldn't leave me greasy and I finally found it! After application my skin was smooth and not oily at all! Love it.
I absolutely love the sunscreen. It does not break me out at all. It's a light. I really enjoy it and I put it on every morning before my make up. I definitely will be purchasing all throughout the summer :)
Rubs on very easily and does not leave residue, we ended up using this on our arms and legs as we likes how light it was. It has great coverage. I will be buying this from here forward.
This sunscreen absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a weird white film on my face. I wear it under my makeup daily.
I wear this under my daily make up. It hasn't caused any break outs or anything like that but it does tend to migrate into my eyes and sting... Then I end up with watering eyes and eye makeup streaming down my face....
This works great for general use. No complaints. Long trip in a convertible, this is the sunscreen for you.However, it's no substitute for a "Sport" sunscreen if you're about to do something wet/sweaty. Learned that one the hard way. That's my fault not the product's though.
Good product
face still breaks out after wearing but not as bad
This is one of the few sunblocks I can wear on my face without breaking out.  It also did not leave my skin feeling greasy, so that was fantastic as well!  I will be ordering more when my current tube runs out!
No worries about getting sun or getting burned in sensitive areas on the face.
Translate review to English
This sunscreen didn't absorb well into my skin. It left white streaks no matter how much I tried to rub it in.
good at providing moisture, don't like the smell personally
Doesn't even feel like you're wearing sunscreen.
Good coverage
if you are looking for white cast free sunscreen , this is the best among all other neutrogena ones
I ordered this because of all the positive reviews from other people with sensitive skin. Unfortunately it has caused me to break out on the cheek and forehead area when I had none before I started using it. Also, I bought it to protect and prevent any more wrinkles on my under eye area but it burns / stings when I put it anywhere near that area! I will try it over makeup but I think it's a lost cause. I usually like Neutrogena products so this is very disappointing.
Great productI have sensitive skin/ very oily skinNo break outs
I have been using this sunscreen for a few years and haven't had acne breakouts from it. Love it!
Great product! Keeps my skin moisturized, clear, and protected.
I have sensitive skin and I'm acne prone so here is my review. I think it doesn't help protect sun burns. I still got sun burned on my nose. I wore it under my makeup and I felt like it made my makeup come off sooner at the end of the day. It felt kind of heavy at first. Made me very oily throughout the day (I have combo skin).
Translate review to English
I was very excited about this product as it had good reviews. Unfortunately, it came used and there was no seal. Half  of the product was missing :(
Works great, doesn’t make me breakout. It’s thicker so you don’t need a lot.
Provides excellent sun protection with no greasy feel. Also doesn’t cause breakouts.
Very nice non greasy formula. Graet on sensitive skin.
Block out harmful raysNo oily residue tooGet that sunny D
Didn’t make me break out!
Excellent product. Goes on evenly, does the job!!I use it everyday!
I loved this moisturizer. I mixed it with my Jojoba Oil and it worked great. I had to stop using it when I started Tretinoin though, as it would sting.
product as described
I used several times and same result: stinging burning of all areas I apply it to. (Face, neck, arms) I don't have sensitive skin either!  Once the stinging went away, it eventually melted/ran and it got in my eyes until I washed it off. Got more acne after using it am 3x a week for 3 weeks(ish).Avoid.Not a good alternative!
Really good coverage and no greasy feel, didn't feel heavy either. I'm a fair skinned red head and loved it.
I've never had this issue with any other spf product, but for some reason this one really bothers my eyes. I guess some gets in my eyes if I sweat or rub them and it burns sooo bad. Otherwise it works fine.
I’m on Accutane and this is a great lotion to u Se
Absorbs well, not as thick as many others. I found it does help keep you more clear. Its my new face & head go to!
Exellent product!
Reasonable price.
I wear this everyday and have not experienced a single breakout or sunburn in the 4 months I have been using it. I work outside 10-12 hours a day in extreme heat and it stays on.
I love this sunscreen. I use everyday and my skin is never oily or greasy. Leaves a nice matte finish.
I have oily skin and this sunscreen doesn't make me have breakouts or even get oily during the day.
Great sunscreen.  My skin always had a tendency to breakout & this is the one sunscreen that does not break me out & gives great protection.
i really enjoyed using this product until i found out that it contains oxybenzone. this is a very well known carcinogen and even the cheapest sunscreens no longer contain oxybenzone these days. can’t believe this is still on the market.
sun protection for my face without the greasy, heavy feeling.
No odor, not greasy. Works well. Did not irritate skin.
Bye to unprotected skin
Does what it says, screens your face from the sun and doesn't make you break out.
Works as advertised.  Our sons use this, since they use benzoyl peroxide.  Does not cause acne and is very gentle.  Good product from Neutrogena.
Great, light formula that doesn't leave a greasy finish like a lot of other sunscreens. No clogged pores or pimples after using this sunscreen for a week.
I love this product, every other sunscreen I breakout with.
I have sensitive skin and this didn’t make me breaks out
Worked well, didn't leave me face super oily. Its light weight and works well for hot texas summer days
Some stuff makes me break out, and being in your 30's, that is definitely not cool.  This stuff applies easily, keeps me from becoming burnt toast, and doesn't make me break out, ever.
Caused my face to break out in a rash after using it for 3 days.
The sunscreen dries quickly and isn't greasy like others I've tried, but this sunscreen irritates my skin--makes it feel like it's burning. Would not recommend for those with sensitive skin.
Causes a bit of a burning sensation when I first apply it but it goes away. Not sure if it's just me or not.
Just a little too thick--But still good!
Not a huge fan of this product.  The sunscreen is pasty and white and doesn't soak into the face very well.  It works, but we won't be buying it again.
The most important for me is that it absorbs very well
My skin soaks it up amazingly and when it’s hot I don’t sweat it off.
Works great
Not heavy on my face. Does not cause breakouts. I love It and it works fantastic.
I find that this product will burn your eyes if you sweat or get into the water.  Perhaps if neither is a concern for you it wouldn't be a problem.  It is true to its labeling and it didn't break me out, but the burning was a deal breaker.
Nothing bad to say!! Doesn’t leave you greasy or with wired white patches!!
Love this, has dry touch and doesn’t leave the white residue
I use this on my face and neck, I've stopped breaking out. Isn't only either.
Good price. If you or your kiddos are prone to acne, this is one that is recommended by dermatologist.
thinner mixture makes for easier put-on the face, etc.
Not for me.  While it worked well as a sunblock, they should remove "Clear Face" from the product. I was at the beach for 4 days and my face broke out so badly. My husband even said it looked like I was a teenager. Very disappointed in a product that has "Clear Face" in its name.
Very liquidy, but dries quickly, so It has cut my face routine time down. So far no break outs. And not a really strong smell either. Thumbs up from me.
This product dried out my skin and caused more acne. I don't think it's the formulation that actually caused acne, it just dried out my combo skin too much, causing acne. It definitely doesn't feel moisturizing even though it can leave a greasy film by the end of the day.
Goes on nice, doesn't leave an oily feel on my face and keeps me burn free!
This goes on very smooth with only minimal white streaks that seem common with higher SPF face creams. I genuinely feel this does a great job for my sensitive skin, great sun protection and doesn't block pores. Definitely recommend it!
Not greasy, and no breakouts. Forget I'm have it on, no sticky layer you feel all day.
Protects with no break outs and I have super sensitive skin. I love it
Product as described and arrived quickly.  I would purchase again.
The product gave my finance pimples and marks. Also, the skin started to burn immediately after applying the sun screen. It’s bad that Amazon is selling such products and we have to a face a lot of stress before marriage.
I liked its good for sunscreening but Not moisturizing.
Goes on nice, doesn't leave my skin feeling like something is on it, and have yet to get a sunburn while using this!
This was what I have been looking for all these years.  I got a nice high SPF in a lotion that did not make my skin breakout.  It takes a little bit to rub it in, but smells nice and does a great job  protecting the skin.
Great
I break out easy with sunscreen and I never have a problem when I use this product
Unfortunately, this still broke me out.  I have oily and acne-prone skin, and after wearing this for a full day (12ish hours) I had small red bumps all over my cheeks.  As I have learned from research online, this was probably due to the product's use of chemical SPF; physical SPF (titanium dioxide, zinc oxide) is more forgiving, and I will be looking for a new SPF with those ingredients.  Hope that last bit of information helps!
i searched for a higher level SPF sunscreen that would not cause my skin to break out. I used it on my recent vacation and it did not disappoint. I came home without sunburn and skin that was blemish free!
Absolutely love this sunscreen for acne prone skin.
bought this for my husband who works outside on occasion and he actually uses it!
Have sense of burning after apply
Nice skin care
Very liquidy and not thick, which I was afraid if. Lasted me a long time because a little bit will spread all over my face for a clear coverage.
I bought this after contemplating making my own sunscreen, but after further research, I decided against it. I've always been a fan of Neutrogena and this doesn't disappoint. Leaves the skin soft, protected, and in its natural skin tone (no whitening effect). I would buy it again!
Says no oxybenzone but then literally has it listed at 4.5% in the ingredients, super misleading. For those wondering why you should care, it’s a skin irritant, a hormone disruptor and is literally classified as a hazardous level eye irritant. Pass.Sad I noticed this way way after purchasing it but still thought I could help someone else!
I have combination/acne prone skin and this sunscreen worked great.  It never felt greasy on my face,  it gave good protection,  and i didn't breakout! I'm officially a fan!
This is my favorite sun screen; goes on smoothly, not heavy or sticky.  Does not seem to affect my pores.  Does the job.
I have acne prone and sensitive skin. Every time I put this product on, my skin would instantly start burning. It’d calm down in about ten minutes but I would obviously not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.
After a week of using this product, I had to stop all together due to the burning sensation this cream gave me, and it wasn't a slight burn. Eventually it got so bad I had to stop and rinse it off as soon as possible due to the pain.  I am not sure if this is a counterfeit or what. also as someone with a darker skin tone this stuff leave one hell of a heavy white cast, more so than previous mineral sunscreens.
It is very smooth and doesn’t dry up my skin.
I just use this one, works perfectly for my face.
This is the best sunscreen I have ever used.  Non greasy and does not smell.
It goes on light, and leaves a slight white cast on my medium skin. However, it pills, which is super obnoxious.
The formula really isn't greasy, and it doesn't leave any residue on my skin.
I have been mixing it with my moisturizer in the morning. Not greasy at all. Feels like I'm not even wearing sunscreen!
I have sensitive skin, and it kind of burns around my lips and eyes. But it's better than most sunblock.
I like it
This is not a 3 pack, only 1 comes.
Just perfect!
Good! :)
Bought this for a vacation just in time...unfortunately that meant I could not return when I received 1 bottle even though it was advertised as 3 bottles. Thought the sale when purchased meant I got a great deal, but turned out to be too good to be true and not a great price for 1 bottle.
I have very fair skin and I do not burn with this product.
I tend to breakout along my chin when wearing facial sunscreens - none with this.  Highly recommend.
I always wear it under my make up. I like it ..it does not leave face greasy and it protects so it's doing what it needs to do. I would buy again.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Doesn't cause breakouts like a lot of other sunscreens do. Non-greasy and easy to apply.
Item was recommended.  Works very well
I have acne prone skin and always use this cream. Totally recommended
Doesn't clog pores or feel heavy and greasy.
no breakouts so far, so i really really like this product, its not greasy it does the job!
Fast and no worries purchase
Doesn’t leave any greasy residue on my face, which is prone to breakouts. Definitely recommend.
Great protection. Does not cause breakouts.
Make my face a little white
Good product
Doesn’t make me break out.
Won't make me break out. Literally any other sunscreen does, so this is huge for me. I also have extremely sensitive / dry skin and it won't irritate my skin.
Good product, absorbs into skin quickly, dry to touch.
Don't workout with this or your eye's will burn! This is intended for day use
Love how this turns matte after half hour n does not burn my sensitive skin
I like everything
A fine product with a great sun protection. But, its a bit heavy on the skin and prolonged application can eventually lead to a bit oily skin.
Like does not make white layers
Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or cause pimples. SPF rating seems optimistic.
I bought this for my son who has very fair skin and severe acne.  He said that it is a bit on the watery side as far as consistency.  But overall, he is pretty happy with it!
I use this stuff every day, doesn't give me any breakouts. Nice price here on Amazon too.
I’ve never had a skin reaction quite like the one I had with this sunscreen. I’ve been on the search for a good sunscreen for daily wear, and saw really good reviews for the clear face one. Tried it and wow... it burned and tingled at first but I didn’t see any swelling or redness. So, I kept it on my face until the redness and dryness kicked in toward the end of the day. Not sure what ingredient it is, but will never purchase this again. I advise a 24 hour swatch test before you put it on your face.
Even though it says it won't cause breakouts, it did for me unfortunately. I got more pimples popping out than usual. I think I'll stick with my Japanese brand sunscreens. On top of the breakout, it stung my eyes when working out. Too bad since I actually like Neutrogena's other products. But everyone's skin is different so it might work for others.
Perfect sunscreen for the acne prone/those with sensitive skin after laser treatment.Wear this everyday and it's changed my skin. I used to be consistently red. This calms my skin down and protects me from UV rays.
Expiration date 05-2021 which is 2.5 years from now. Excellent.
No noticeable difference in acne prevention
GREAT sunblock and did not give me breakouts at all! Easy to use and will take longe to be done
Really nice. It does not make your face as white as other sunscreens. My face looks normal not white and greasy. I don't mind wearing this every day.
Will not break you out!
It was definitely easy to spread.
Very good, light and easy to spread I wear on my face daily. It lasts a while too, so get it! :)
Excellent sunscreen for faces that doesn't sit on the skin.
Most sun protection makes my face break out, but this did not! No sunburn and no zits - I highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin.
great to wear under makeup
I have been using the same sunscreen lotion for more than 6 months now. Very light weight...Love it.
Perfect for face. Leaves no white spots. But this one
Only sunscreen I can use on my face without breaking out.
This is a light sunblock lotion that does not ball up under makeup. It feels a little greasy at first, but after a minute or so it dries to a soft, almost powdery finish. Does not break me out. Love it!
I went ahead and applied this product on my face... a minute after I felt extremely burning and got rashes all over my face... 6 hours later its still very itchy. Please learn from my mistake.. this was definitely not a safe product for me.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Goes on light, not thick or greasy.  Does not make my skin break out.  Love this.
Product arrived in a timely manner.  Totally satisfied. Sunscreen applies in a smooth and non-oily manner.
Non greasy with good protection. Dries quickly.
I have been using this sunscreen since last year but somehow it always irritates my face and my eyes. I'm not sure if it's because I put on too much. But it definitely doesn't break me out, I'll give it that.
I use Banan Boat on my body as it is cheap but for my face I prefer using the good stuff, nothing but Neutrogena​ touches my face.
Let us be serious.  Use the best.  This is the best product.  It not only protects from the sun but is easy on the skin.  I have used it for years and will continue because it does the job!
My mom loves it. She uses every day. This sunscreen doesn't leave the skin white or oily.
Translate review to English
Been using this for several years and love the results. No burns, no oily mess, no dripping, no sweat issues, just good clean protection.
Really great sunblock for the face. I break-out really easily and even after multiple applications over many days my skin remained break-out free. Stays in place well even while sweating.
I have very oily skin and this sunscreen didn't feel oily at all. No complaints on this product.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Great for combination skin. No breakouts
Horrible. Very greasy, no matter finish as advertised. Made me break out all over my face and swell after three days! It took over a week and a very regimented skincare for my skin to get back to normal. I have very tough skin and I had a terrible reaction. Will never use again
When you apply the product on the face it stays sticky and heavy. I don’t like it
Love this.Just a bit oily.But I did not break out
Left my skin feeling tacky and clogged my pores. Sun protection is good though.
Translate review to English
Only sunscreen that doesn't clog my pores yet still protects! Comes off a little bit with sweat, but not too bad.
Good
I am very pleased with this sunblock.  It did exactly what it promised.  It is not greasy and I used it on my face - some days without makeup and other days under my liquid foundation.  I will definitely order this product again.
Feels so good on your face
I love this sunscreen for my face.  It's the first one I've ever tried that doesn't feel greasy or look shiny.  I can even put it under my eyes with no irritation.
Translate review to English
The product is really runny.
didn't even get a close to the equator tan with this stuff!  does burn a little in the upper cheek/under eye area, but it goes away.
This really does not break me out so I have finally found a facial sunscreenthat does what it says. I just had a BCC removed on my forehead so I am takingthis serious now.
lasts so long bought it months ago and still have it
This stuff wears great under makeup. It also helps stave off sunglasses tan lines. It also makes me feel like I'm not going to wind up with skin cancer on my face.
This is my favorite facial sunscreen. It works really well.
My holy grail sunscreen!!
I like that:- it is not as greasy (oily) as other sunscreens I have used.- it works well even in sweaty conditions
Great sunscreen - not oily.  However, it stings if you get it in your eyes.
I use it daily.
Works great but has oxobenzone
Effective and easy to use. Great product!
Report abuse
It is great
It's alright for the most part except it burns the eyes.
Very good. Almost disappears. Very little to no oil left on the skin. Gives good skin protection against the sun. Doesn't sting.
I’ve never broken out so obviously from a product. I am prone to break out on my chin but with a good routine I hadn’t had any issues in over a year. I used this once and got a few zits on my chin. Then the next time I used it I got about 10 zits on my chin. Funny that it’s labeled clear skin, it was very bad for my skin.
hasn't caused any break outs
Doesn't make me break out!
Just as good as the more expensive fancy face sunscreens.
Great sun protection
Very good for acne prone skin and sensitive skin. It does not appear to cause break outs or cause my skin to become red like some other sunscreens do.
Great face lotion. Great coverage and does not feel greasy
Translate review to English
Really like the product!
Best sunscreen on the planet. A must have
Its not oily at all and keeps my face from getting sunburns. I will definitely buy again.
The best sunscreen!
This is great for oily skin as it seems to control the oiliness and shiny face.
I'm used to SPF15 Oil of Olay for daily facial use, so using Neutrogena's product at SPF 30 was a bit thicker than I was used to. It goes on more like a sunblock than a lotion, but I'm sure it's more effective as well.
Doesn’t go on too thick.
doesn't leave your skin oily (and I have oily/combo skin)
I wish I had read the reviews on this before I ordered it.  I thought it would be fine, though, since I’ve used a Neutrogena moisturizer for years with no issues.  Do not use this if you have sensitive skin!  I used it one time and broke out in a bad rash all over my chest and part of my face.  It took several days of itching before it finally faded.
good
Great for Tahiti, but I would suggest using SPF 45 there.
great face lotion sunscreen for strong sun and non oily
This is a good product but my skin is a little too sensitive for this
Well the project is good, but on my skin is still getting through oil
I really like this sunblock because it is almost watery. I recommend applying sunblock BEFORE moisturizer because the watery consistency is more easily absorbed when you apply it prior to the (assumedly) thicker moisturizer. No breakouts.
Very good!
Not greasy, works well, stayed on even when sweating, did not cause breakouts or clogged pores.
Love that it doesn't look oily on your face
I love this sunscreen
This immediately gave me a chemical burn, it felt like my skin was on fire. I know that I may be sensitive but i have never had such a terrible reaction. I am still suffering and my skin is peeling as a result :-(
Does not dry out face. So far, so good.
Very good
I have tried several different types of sunblock. However, I have not found one that does not cause acne . Unfortunately, this one also caused me to have a break out.  I'm not too sure if it's because the product is oily but this sunblock has not worked for me.  I have not gotten a sunburn but I am still looking for a sunblock that willl protect my skin and not cause me to have a break out.
Great
Very good product.
Not greasy.  Sinks into skin.  Don't have to worry about breakouts.  Great product.
Works well
I have pcos and have had acne problems for a long time.... I was nervous about putting any lotion on my face but this worked well. Didn't notice it causing any problems at all!
Didn't make my very sensitive face break out and protected it from the sun in SUNNY Mexico!
Best sunscreen!
This goes on super light and protects my face all day.
Light and not greasy.  Absorbs well.
Super Runny! I haven't noticed it cause acne yet. I've only used it twice but it is so runnyyyyy.
I like it, but it is a little thick for my liking.
Such a nice smell , light and feels like moisturizer. Love it .
Blocks the sun and doesn't clog my pores. This lotion is exactly as they describe it. It's good for the long days outside without having to worry about getting pimples!
Excelent
Received product in excellent condition. Thank you!
This is great for sensitive skin like mine
Beautiful product that unfortunately stained and ruined three sweaters in first week of use. I could not see the discoloration until after they were washed and the stains set.. also stings around my eyes. Otherwise made my skin look really nice. Loved that it helped  smooth out scars and imperfections beautifully.  I was wearing product on my face and neck.I'm sure it does protect from the sun. maybe in a v neck,  bathing suit, or just applied to face the staining might not be an issue.
I was really looking forward to using this, as I'm moving to Nevada and will have to use sunscreen most of the year. However, I was really disappointed as it made my face red, stung my skin and left little white particles all over my face. I don't recommend if you have sensitive skin like I do. I should have read the reviews before buying.
Use this as part of a new anti-acne daily routine. No breakouts from this product in combination with a couple others.
Good
Yes
Don't get it ANY where near your eyes
Good leave my face moisturized
I tried another top rates sunscreen from Amazon and my skin broke out immediately. Neutrogena is always the best! My skin looks great and I feel my makeup goes on really well over it.
This is very good sunscreen for specially oily skin.
Best face sunscreen I have used so far. I use it daily and have no complaints.
Great
I would not use this anywhere near your eyes. It burns very very bad.
Allergic people DO NOT USE.I’m allergic and this product gave me a bad allergic reaction
what I paid was less here on Amazon than what I would have paid in a drugstore BUT the price is still high - you're really just paying for the brand - I would rather go to a drugstore or Trader Joes and pick up cheaper sunscreen that will do the same things and perhaps might even provide more protection
Great sunscreen! No breakouts or oily feel!
Love the sunscreen. Great for your face when it is prone to breakouts.
Light, clean, and didn't make me break out.
My face was perfectly clear until I had this sunscreen on for two hours. I applied shortly before I went outside to do some gardening for a few hours and washed it off after I was done and immediately noticed the irritation it had caused. I’m now breaking out across my forehead, nose and chin after using it and I also got slightly burnt. I used spray sunscreen of the same SPF over the rest of my body but only got burnt on my face.

Had terrible breakouts from this product even though it says it's for acne-prone skin. Unfortunately I had to leave my face alone for a WHOLE MONTH to repair the terrible cystic acne that I got from this product (I've never even had acne so deep in my skin before). I switched to Paula's Choice sunscreen after such a terrible experience and it is like night and day. I guess you pay for what you get.
Waste the money
Never again
Definitely helps with acne prone skin.

Great price when I ordered this.  I use this for my entire body not just my face.
Excellent sun screen -- fragrance free, non-greasy, and doesn't irritate my skin which is pretty sensitive. I just bought the 100 SPF version to try. Highly recommend Neutrogena's sunscreens.
I love this. It's not greasy and slightly mattifying. Works well under makeup. I feel like I'm not even wearing any lotion on my face.
This is the best block I have found for the face. Goes on dry, feels light, great protection for hours after application, even when swimming. I like it better than the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer.
I really like it because it does not leave that greasy felt on your skin. When applied on your skin, it stays clean and pretty much non-noticeable. I highly recommend it.
As good as my more expensive one.
Neutrogena Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid-Lotion Sunscreen SPF 55 3 oz (Pack Of 3) - even though I ordered this since it was a Pack of 3 description, I only received one 3 oz bottle.
This sunscreen does not break me out.
This is the only sunscreen my husband can wear on his face because of his sensitive skin. It covers well, doesn't burn, and isn't greasy.
the only sunscreen that I use, wonderful coverage and protections. must reapply as recommended.
Nice sunscreen
I strongly recommend it.
Excelente!
nice
Excellent sunscreen for everyday...SPF30 is a good compromise...
Don't buy product's with chemical SPF (for your face especially), as it protects your skin chemical compounds breakdown and create free radicals.Even Neutrogena has better products, like this one
This doesn't sting my face like most other sunscreens and it doesn't leave me feeling oily and gross.
I wore this every day in Mexico and experienced no breakouts. I'm extremely happy with this purchase. Thank you Neutrogena!!
Safe sunscreen for acne prone skin.
LOVE! not greasy, and excellent coverage.
Love it and it hasn't broke me out
Great coverage for face and chest
I bought this because I suffer with rosacea and was looking for a sunscreen that wouldn’t cause breakouts, this caused a flair up before the end of the day.
Great sunscreen.  I use it consistently.
Very good sunscreen.
Worked Great! Didn't irritate my skin and my face didn't burn.
Works well and doesn't make my oily skin greasy.  Will definitely buy again.  No overpowering sunscreen scent.
I will continue to purchase this product for the rest of my life.
✔️
Great sunscreen, doesn't make you oily or breakout at all. Hurts a bit if you get it in your eyes but that is to be expected. Will buy again!
As expected.
I break out with most sunscreen and I tried a lot of them including la Roche Posay. I used it for a week and it still didn't break me out. Wow.
Love it!
As a sunscreen this works amazingly well, however it makes my face brake out bad and all over.
perfect
Good!
Not easy to spread and feels like rubbing chalk on your face. Doesn't rub in easily either so you walk around with a white face.
I have sensitive skin and when I use this sunblock my face feels like it's on fire and becomes an angry red for 5 - 10 minutes after application. While it remains true to its word that it hasn't caused any breakouts, I can't use this product without physical pain. So I've abandoned this and am trying out other brands geared towards sensitive skin.
Absorbs very quickly and completely matte. No greasy or powdery residue, and little scent.Goes well under makeup..
This sunscreen does not make me break out and I have very acne-prone skin. It feels very light on my face too and my face doesn't look like an oily mess.
This product is a waste of money. I should have trusted the previous reviews more. Shortly after you apply this sunscreen it has flakes that makes you feel and look disgusting. It does it regardless if I apply anything above or below the sunscreen or nothing at all. Such an expensive sunscreen that I will not waste my money on again.
Great product
😊
love this product, doesn't make me break out, and is not heavy like most
No negative skin reactions, I'm downnn hahaha
Smooth, stays great under make up.
I don't think it's protective...says water resistant but I think it washes off.My kids have been wearing it from 3-5pm and still getting burned.
I have bought this before and didn't use it a lot and recently I bought it again, this time it irritated the sides of my face and caused it to peel. I thought it was just me but then my wife was using it and it irritated her face too. Don't know if it's been made differently or if I got a bad batch. I won't be buying it again.
This sunscreen is really oil free and with a very light texture. It won't leave you White like a ghost. Really like it.
good
Works as promised!
works well
This sunscreen is great. It is light and doesn't make me break out after using it.
Doesn’t work! I used this sunscreen to go for a walk in the bright Florida sun for 50 min. My face is all burnt! What on Earth is that? This is extremely upsetting and I would recommend you stay away from this stuff. It obviously does not do what it claims.
I should have read the ingredients before purchasing. I do not like to use chemical sunscreens. If you don't mind using them then this should be fine for acne prone skin.
This sunscreen flakes so easily it looks like i’m exfoliating my face every time i put it on. it’s supper unflattering and even the lightest eyebrow itch will make you look like your face has dandruff.
Nice and light sunscreen.
Love it !! Super good and doesn't cause any breakouts !
The price is low.
clear like wear nothing. Exactly what I want
Nice and light, not oily, works great
I have never suffered from acne, pimples or anything similar... but guess what THIS got me like  a 13 years old going through puberty.
I think it is ok, send it to my dad.
I use it for running outdoors. The sweat drops naturally contain the lotion from my forehead and when they get near or inside my eyes, it hurts badly and induces crippling tears for half a day! Far severer and longer than any other facial sun blocks i ever used.
Works great on acne prone skin.
So far so Good...Transplant Patient,need the Protection for Just driving around...
Pretty good
I love this product so much. Doesn't leave your skin looking shiny or greasy. Great for acne prone skin like mine, long lasting. Great for wearing under makeup. Wouldn't buy any other brand.
I look for three things in my sunscreen, 1) Sun protection 2) No white cast and 3) Affordable. The only thing good about this sunscreen is that it's more affordable. I wear sunscreen diligently and reapply every 2 - 3 hours but with this, I still got a tan so the Sun protection is not as effective as it claims.
Excelente
Sun Block
Not as light or clear as I'd ideally prefer but does the trick
We love that it doesn't cause us to get break outs like some other oily sign blocks.
Love it! Acne free!
This has become a popular sunscreen between myself and my husband.
Rub on ....not sme
It sting my eyes! The whole day my eyes were uncomfortable. But besides that it was... Ok? Looking for another sunscreen because I cannot keep using this one
Good sunscreen without making my acne worse. My dermatologist recommended it.
First sunscreen I've ever used that didn't break me out!
Product works well to block sun and protect face but the ingredients cause concern with carcinogens.
I wish Neutrogena would make a suncreen for people sensitive to avobenzone and other -zone chemicals. I knew I was sensitive to the -zones but Neutrogena seems to be a reputable and affordable brand so I thought I'd try it. It doesn't go on greasy, but it stings my face so makes me sweat and then my face is oily and shiny from suncreen dissolving or falling off.
Worst crap I have ever put on my face. I broke out immediately after one use and this was the worst break out I've had since I was teenager. So bad that coworkers asked me if what was wrong with my face!  I threw this stuff in the trash. If you have sensitive or acne prone skin don't believe the lie on the label. You will NOT have a clear face of you go anywhere near this product. Awful awful awful. Negative 5 stars is more accurate than 1. Amazon needs to implement a 0 star rating at least.
Love this product.  We all have very sensitive skin and it doesn't burn or make my eyes water at all.
Not too strong a scent, doesn't cause any skin problems, and I feel better going out knowing I'm wearing it.
came unsealed. these products always have to come sealed, it wasn’t even in a protective plastic bag, it just came in the bubble amazon package by, the product itself. I always check if the product has a seal but this one did not. Most likely has been tampered with and/or counterfeit.
Not greasy. Looks well.
I have oily acne prone skin and this made me break out so so bad. I returned it, by far the worst sunscreen I’ve used so far.
Good
I thought this sunscreen was better than other products and worked better until I found out the rating of this product on ewg.org. This sunscreen is very poorly rated in terms of its efficiency to protect the skin from UVA and UVB and toxicity. It contains a number of harmful chemicals, such as oxybenzone. It's funny that this product is advertised as not causing break out when it obviously contains chemicals that might cause some harmful long-term effects
Great product. Not oily or white!
Works great and less irritating that other products
Works as represented, particularly for sensitive complexions.  The least-greasy sunscreen I've ever used.  Costs more than some, but worth it.
Good if you're pale, not good if you're not. Leaves a whitish cast on the face and I cannot use it as a woman of color.
Good!
Unfortunately, I broke out all over my chin from this product...Funny, because it's advertised as "clear face". I'm disappointed and I won't be using it ever again.
My all time favourite face sunscreen. Not greasy at all and have good coverage.  An excellente product.
This has been my favorite for three years now. Doesn't break me out and it stays completely matte through out the day
Maybe it's just me but it burns my skin when I put it on my face. I can't use it.
Great product
I'm a skin cancer survivor. This works great on my oily complexion.
I did not like this product. The consistency of the sunscreen is very unlike the regular Neutrogena lotion. It did its job as far as preventing sunburn, but is not worth the price and is inferior to the regular lotion.
If you have sensitive skin please don’t  buy this. I got a really bad rash on my face from it my face is peeling and before this my skin was good really good I always take care of my skin but this product messed up my skin
i like it
Very good
I found out it still made my face break out then I found out I was allergic to one of the ingredience and I cannot use it anymore. When I read clear face I assumed it would work obviously its not as great as I thought. So now I have almost a full tube that I don't know what to do with.
Used daily on a 5 days beach vacation to Gulf Shores. Never got burned on my face at all and no break out
Not enough to moisturize dry skin, sometimes it becomes flaky + don't use if you already have acne.. use only to prevent acne.
Excelente
I was looking to switch my sunscreen since my usual brand is twice the price for half the size. I liked Neutrogena products in the past and thought this would be a great alternative to what I use currently. It doesn't clog pores which is nice. However, after a day of use my face broke out in these dry red patches. It completely irritated my skin
This sunscreen did not apply well and caused white beads all over my face that had to be wiped off. I do not use any other products on my face before sunscreen. I went to the store and bought the same item and it did not do this. Save your money!!
It broke me out bad. I even got a big nodule and I hardly EVER get those. My skin was pretty clear for me and now I’m all broken out again. On top of that it made my face super oily and greasy.  Would not recommend.
Nice
Love it.  It's the only one that doesn't cause my face to break out.  Still feels a little sticky.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
This burned my eyes and caused extreme swelling in one of them. While I was on vacation. I obviously didn’t apply this to my eyes, but definitely do not apply this and then touch your face. I believe I had an adverse reaction due to pre existing sensitivities but do be careful!
I like it a lot, it doesn't burn my face.  I would buy this again.
Great for hypersensitive skin.
Love this!
Love!!! Not greasy and does not leave a white paste.
exactly as advertised. protected on very hot sunny days with no breakouts, etc.
It makes me break out
Leaves a mega white cast
still makes me break out,  but doesn't feel greasy
It's okay
Chemical burns! I tried to use this on my 8 years olds face.... she started screaming it was burning and I wiped as much off as I could.... with 24 hours, her entire face was peeling (and no, she was not sun-burned).
Oily and made me break out. Sits on skin funny. Not a good product.
Its amazing,a clear,not heavy cover on your skin,with no smell.skin care is very important to me so im so(!!) glad i bought it. :)
Love the texture of this stuff. Doesn't make my skin greasy or breakout and love the high SPF.
Great quality very easy on skin
Good
It burned 4 peoples faces and left red blotchy rashy marks everywhere. Do not buy this!
Works well
When it came to me, the bottle was covered in sand and had been opened. GROSS!
Make sure to spot test first. I am not easily allergic to chemicals but this one made me break out in a rash.
Non greasy
Great sun screen product, not to oily, good over all.
Excelente
Endocrine disrupter: contains oxybenzone
This is the best sunscreen lotion for me.  There is none better that I know about!  Nothing else compares.
Does not sting in eyes, does not look oily on the skin. Great buy!
LOVE IT
This product really fits my needs;  the sunscreen if definitely effective.
Creates long lasting matte effect on the face. This keeps oil from building up during the day.
Excellent!
It's not greasy.
I wear this everyday and my normal/sensitive skin does not show any irritation!
Very light and smooth on the skin, no heavy residue, easy to spread. Hopefully protects as well.
Great for my Oily and dry combo skin. No break outs as promised. Has a soft pleasing sent.
I always get neutrogena sunscreens; they are light and easy to apply.
Note that the title is misleading. This does not come in a pack of 3. I just got one 3-oz bottle.
Tried to use it for sunscreen but when applied caused face to burn so had to quickly wash it off. Had to throw it in the trash.
While it does protect from the sun, it still makes my skin break out :(
Left a white film on my face.
I don’t like it!! It cause burning to my eyes (even when I don’t put any there) and I feel my face is burning when I apply this!!
Great product non breakout too! Wore it in Punta Cana didn't get burnt at all.
love this stuff.  It doesn't make my face break out when using it.
I have oily skin but it didn’t suit me.. did not like it
The smell is not pleasant but its not bad either.  I have been using it for  days, seems to provide protection but it burns for about 30 seconds after application. Will provide update soon
Love it! mate finish
it feels nice, but both my children got really burned with it. They are not fair skinned at all and have never gotten burned like this.This maker has been on the news for the SPFS not being correct, and I believe it.
My go to for sunscreen.
This product made my skin SO oily. I tried using a little bit less product every day but the outcome was still the same. I ended up breaking out. I like Neutrogena and have had success with a few of their other products. But this one's a fail.
If you love yourself do not buy this. Never had a reaction to something like this before. Lol the bottle title is such a lie.
nice
Only sunscreen my husband will use. I prefer a mineral based product, which in my mind is the only true sun block.
Sound is good....but a pain to connect!  You have to keep turning itBack on manually to connect...So you use it for a while...do something else...then want music again...gotta go to it and turn it back on...
The whole point is to be able to use this product and NOT breakout.  I broke out within days of first using it.  I won't be giving it a second chance.
I purchased this for a cruise hoping it would do as it claims, "no breakouts". I broke out in whiteheads all over my face. I have oily skin and sometimes am acne prone. Took me a week to get rid of the bumps.
Neutrogena helps kee my face cleat
Makes your skin feel powdery
The best sunscreen. My face does not look oily
I will no longer purchase Neutragena products since the company is not certified cruelty-free.
It doesn't have a white cast but it does leave white residue, which imo is worst than white cast
a little heavy
Nice sunscreen!
This is advertised as SunBLOCK, not sunscreen. Actually when I bought it, the picture showed it saying Sunblock, although I see now the picture has been changed but not the title of the product. Sunblock and sunscreen are very different and this is not what I bought.
It had no cover and the it was opened. (not sealed)
this is good sunscreen, no fragrance. but it burns my skin after five minutes on my face. nowhere else...just on my nose and cheeks.  i'll go back to using the natural, and white, titanium dioxide baby stuff, for my nose and cheeks...
Best sun block ever!
This stuff breaks me out badly. I have to wear sunscreen daily. Oddly enough I found the Neutrogena in the yellow bottle (not advertised for face) does not.
I like the texture!!
Works so well, goes on easily and leave a matte finish.  This is my go-to facial sunscreen from now on.
Very easy to apply and dries basically instantly
It helps dry pimples!
On the front this product boasts of being oxybenzone free, but it contains avobenzone, which can stain clothes, especially around shirt collars when it mixes with perspiration. Amazon will not let you return it.
This sunscreen seems to work well, but caused a painful burning sensation on my face, particularly around the eyes, as soon as it was applied.  The pain continued for more than an hour, until I was able to wash it off.  My kids complained of the same problem.  I will not be buying it again.
My favorite face sunscreen hands down. Not greasy, doesn't sting in the eyes and doesn't make my face break out!
My never-ending search for an inexpensive, non-white-face, tears free facial sunscreen continues and another one in the bin. :-(
I would not recommend buying this product at all if you have oily and sensitive skin , every time I use it my face becomes more oily and my skin breaks out.
Love the 30 SPF block, Hard to go wrong with Neutrogena, have other products, but the SPF isn't the 30...(less). Shipped quickly. Would buy again.
Doesn't cause breakouts and I am 100% prone to breaking out esp with sunscreens. highly recommend this!
No sunburn - broke out  my cheeks though ):Combo Skin - Fair toned- Female - in humid enviorment
You need to wear this stuff and this is a  good one.  Not too thick.
it was causing breakouts and stings your eyes very badly when accidentally gets in
I have used this sunscreen in the past and have favorable results
It came open, if I couldn’t leave any stars I would. Very unsatisfied and very unsanitary. Gross & disgusting
bought this item 12/18/14 it has an expiration date of  6/2016 the neww one which i just received on 03/3/16 has an expiration date of 07/2016 this doesn't give me much shelf life that is why the low rating
this is amazing stuff. probably going to use this for the rest of my life.
My doctor says do not use less than 50 spf sunscreen. This works great!
Good product!
Not oily, definitely didn't cause breakouts. I feel better using this on my face than traditional sunscreen
The best on the market
I had melanoma and take covering up seriously.  This product works best for me.
Makes your face burn which is exactly what I didn’t want....
great coverage!  highly recommend.
Finally a sunscreen that does not feel gross, and I am not allergic to -what's not to like!
This morning, my skin was clear.  Now it’s bumpy and angry.  I haven’t had anything more than a stray pimple for probably a decade!  I’m so mad.
Great sun protection without oily face or breakouts.
This says a pack of 3 but there was only 1 in there.
Made my skin burn. I don't have sensitive skin and this thing is definitely not safe. Id rather spend my money in high quality and waste it on this cheap stuff.
It made me breakout. I don't have acne, I just get really greasy in the summer time. Disappointed.
Great sunblock for your face. My husband uses it on his lips and bald head too. Non greasy, too
This product is really fakeSmell like gasoline
Worked great.
Light non-oily facial spf option
This does not leave my skin feeling greasy and doesn't make me reek of sunscreen.
Not going to use since there is no seal, how weird 😒🤦🏻‍♀️
Good stuff
I have sensitive skin and this sun block is scent free, moisturizing and really works well.
It came as expected,has a nice texture,and is good so far
Very sticky.. not like it
Protects from sunburn, good consistency, not greasy and doesn't make my face shiny, works good under makeup.  You'll be happy with your purchase.
This is the best sunscreen I've found to use on my face. My skin is already naturally oily, and this product is perfect.
Goes on evenly & doesn't feel greasy.
Great for people who break out easily.
Light and does not make me break out.
okay
Came with the plastic wrapping already ripped open on both sides, can't tell if it's been used or not but I don't want to take any risks
I used this sunscreen for years until I bought this one from amazon....I don’t know why but I gave me an allergy in my face.
This is a wonderful moisturizer, as well as sunscreen. It doesn't cause any breakouts and I have tried many creams.
The product arrived only as a single, not a pack of 3
love the product. Does not cause skin breakout!!
good product
does the job
The lotion’s too seal was broken, it was all over in the package when we received it.  Will be throwing it away, what a waste.
Neutrogena's Clear Face Sunblock is a great product.  It is one of the few that does not make me break out.
This lotion is great !!!
The product burned my skin and left red, irritated bumps on my face.
Didn’t come wrapped in anything at all besides the shipping bag. Completely open and exposed, i can’t use it because I’m concerned it’s been tampered with.....
doesn't absorb well. Leaves a white mask on the face
Not good for sensitive skin. Irritating.
This sun screen stings your face like no other. It's extremely painful such that it has to be removed.  Worst if all it can't be returned!
This is the worst skincare product I have ever purchased. It is not moisturizing and does not protect you from the sun. My advice, use what you are putting on your kiddos.
Works great.
This damn sunscreens burns my face, I don't know if they changed the formula or what because I never had issues before
This is one of the few sunscreens that doesn't make my face breakout. Love it!
Every single time I've used this, I've woken up with a face full of acne the following day. Extremely irritating for my skin.
Goes on and doesn't feel too oily, but it does feel like it burns a bit. It did protect me against the sun. But after using it for a week itdid start causing whiteheads like most sunscreens do. So no, it is not clear face for me, Disappointing...
Leaves my skin very tacky and wet looking for about an hour after application. I can't apply my powder foundation on top without it looking cakes. The smell is plastic and chemical. I'll be using on beach days only to use it up and continuing my search for a decent facial sunscreen.
I think it works just like any other sunscreen out there.As for the burn, dayummmm it hurts.  Definitely not made for your face.  And DEFINITELY don't itch your eyes unless you've washed your hands beforehand.
perfect
I have very sensitive skin and unfortunately this broke me out horribly. It felt nice underneath my makeup, and I think it even made my skin less oily throughout the day. However I only wore it twice and after the second day my face was covered in painful acne.
It burns my skin. After applying this sunscreen, the top of my fingers became extremely dry. Imagine what it does to your face.
I picked this sunscreen up at my local grocery store. I LOVE how it feels on my skin and as far as I can tell, it does a fine job protecting my skin from the sun.My biggest issue is that this stuff stings my eyes like CRAZY. I have pretty fair skin and am prone to burning quite easily in the summer, so I'm no stranger to sunscreen and its risks. I have pretty sensitive eyes, so I've mastered the art of NOT getting stuff in my eyes when I'm putting it on my face. I don't know what it is about this stuff, but every single time I've applied it, my eyes start stinging and watering non-stop for at least 10 minutes. I wouldn't say it's debilitating or anything, but it's a major inconvenience. Since I started using this product, I have tried a few other sunscreens (none of which are designated as facial sunscreens) and my eyes have been fine.I really want to like this product. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and leaves no residue besides my tears 😢
Does what is described
Does not cause breakouts and gives great coverage! I would highly recommend this alone or with makeup as a daily sunblock.
Be careful not to apply this close to your eyes. This product will sting your eyes badly! And you can not return this.
Didn't get any where near my eyes, but when I perspired slightly it ran into my eyes making them water and burn. Will not purchase again.
Love this stuff!  It's non-greasy and doesn't make my skin break out!
Not sure if it is even safe to use.Product arrived unsealed in a brown envelope with no packaging slip.Like someone had already used it and just pulled it out of their medicine cabinet and mailed it to me.
Great for acne prone skin!
Works great!  Soaks right into the skin, doesn't leave any white residue.
Great, non-greasy SPF
I loved
This product made my face feel like it was on fire.  I discontinued use and will be returning for refund
As expected
Unhappy 🙁 Customer
Too thick and sticky.
Very nice. leaves no residue.

Worked great.  Not greasy and stayed on after being in the water.
Hi there,today when I went to use the Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion that I ordered back in February i realized it smelt funny and when i looked at the expiration date it had expired in 2007. This was very disturbing as now the window to return it is gone. Please take a look at your products and make sure they are not expired!!!!!!
Great protection during my vacation.
The best stuff available - imo
Package opened. Looks used.
This sunscreen provides excellent protection without clogging my pores! It has a clean and dry feeling and a neutral smell.
watery???
TI did not like the runny and super thin texture.
Love this stuff, I've been a faithful user of it for 10+ years.
I use this every morning on my face and neck. It is nice and light and non greasy. Love it.
Omg I began breaking out more. It burnt when applying my skin did not look healthy. I’m so disappointed I was really excited about using this products
Really stings your eyes. This is is a face cream. They need to do better.
Absorbency was great. Will it again
Works as described.
Works great and applies easily.
Burns when it gets in your eyes.
Feels very greasy on my face never did soak in. Made my eyes itch. Would not recommend.
I break out after using this thing
Whiteheads everywhere! WTF! I broke out after one use. Never again. And I got sunburned!
On time & as described
This stuff broke out my face and was very very greasy. My foundation was sliding around my face by the end of the day.  :(  I have tried Elta MD UV clear sunscreen for my face, and found it works much better.
Very light texture, not greasy. Easy to apply under makeup.
love it, but post fee a bit expensive
Rubs in well, no mess!
I purchased "Neutrogena Clear Face Break-Out Free Liquid-Lotion Sunscreen SPF 55 3 oz (Pack Of 3)" however, only 1 single 3 oz tube arrived.
This gave me millia after 2 days of use, with no other new products.
Don’t plan on sweating or getting wet while wearing this. It BURNS your eyes for days
I can't say it did not make me breakout but I did breakout less. So 2 stars for that
It doesn’t play well with any other products. All I used was a toner and serum and this left little white balls on my face. It’s definitely a no go for me
As advertised, this did not clog my pores and cause acne.
Completely non-greasy and makes my face feeling very soft.
This product made my face break out. I have a clear face. Suncreen tends to do this to my face.
excellent, doesn't run or get in your eyes.... works well in medium sunshine
Goes on very easy and not oily.
The ingredients in this product are not as expected.
This is a chemical sunscreen, which is NOT recommended to apply on face skin. It burns and causes break outs. I do not recommend.
I have very sensitive skin and this product burns like crazy when I apply it. If you have sensitive skin or eczema, avoid at all cost!
Perfect size.
Sometimes I have issues with SPF products stinging my skin, even if they are marketed towards sensitive skin. This is one of those products for me.
Item arrived without a seal. During this pandemic, that is certainly far from okay.
Love it!
Product is fine.  However, I ordered a 3 pack, as stated on website & email receipt, I only received ONE.
ok
Beware, may be quite old. I had to return my order. I was not happy.
Came with no protective seal/shrink wrap around the cap. Sketchy.
This breaks out the skin and makes it very oily! Not worth the money at all.
Loved the product. Doesn't cause breakout for sure.
The only sunblock that won't cause me breakouts.
My favourite sunscreen
Fine, Just what my dermatologist said to use.
Made my face burn, and I don't even have sensitive skin
Just ok.
I really like it.  Not shiny, doesn't irritate my eyes.
Nice sunblock for face! Very light without smell.  Good product!
Came quickly works great
Best sunblock around. Not greasy, no sunburn.
The bottle leaked everywhere in the package
Leaves white residues after application so had to wipe it off... 😩
Great
good
Vary good
great product
Feels great, non-oily.  Easy application.  No zits afterwards!
Thanks
Broke me out 🙁
Annoying that it says pack of 3, but yet it’s actually only one tube... 🤷🏼‍♀️ False advertisement for sure!
The only sunscreen I use on my face. No breakouts!
Great! No breakouts. No sunburn.
I bought two but one of the is used
Non-greasy, great on my sensitive skin!
SPF 30 is great. SPF 55 irritates my skin. I could not use it.
This product makes your face feel tingly and burns. Do not use!
Love it.
Oily, sits on top of skin, caused breakout and can’t wear makeup over it.
I found this product to be too watery
No safety seal on product
nice lotion for the face
work good with me , no acne outbreak
I broke out....
It is too watery, but it works well.
Very light non greasy.
Buyer be aware; I only received 1, when the title clearly says pack of 3. :/
as described, no surprises
Love it! Non greasy!
This made my face burn, and I don’t even have sensitive skin. I wish I could return it. What a waste of money
Caused acne
Too greasy and never stays on face.
great. not greasy.
The product was advertised as a pack of 3, but I only received one.
Ummm it says pack of 3 but I got 1 😒 Buyers be aware
Ripped off. I could have gotten the 1 bottle at my local Walmart for less!
No idea if it's any good.  Product arrived leaking.  Returns not allowed.
My Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid came opened with the safety seal removed. I will not use it on my face. I'm sad that I waisted my money.
Works as advertised!
Works so well :)
This was advertised as a pack of 3, I only received 1 item.
This item description is for a 3-pack. Beware, you will only receive ONE.
True breakout free
Non greasy
good product
I bought it on 2018/09, after used 2month relized this one expired on 2016/06!!!!
This was advertised as a Pack of 3, however only one arrived.
Not oily..truly noncomedogenic
I would love to rate this high but after seeing gruesome photos of neutrogena's animal testing in china, I can't. I am ashamed for buying this product.
This is not a 3 pack.  This is 1 bottle.
Light!
Great!!
Good
Not Sun Block as immage shows. Received Sun Screen.
Clumps up can not be used under makeup just horrible sunscreen
WRONG REPRESENTATION - ONLY  RECIEVED 1 TUBE IN PACKAGE
did not like it.  broke out and burned my skin.  I am Medium complexion and never burn :(
Great for oily skin
This sun screen chemically burned my face very badly and caused it to blister for weeks. Never use this or any neutrogena product. They are the worst type of money grubbing company that pumps there products full of cheap sludge.
Works pretty well.
very good!
I started breaking out one day after wearing this sunscreen even though it says "Clear face." Extremely disappointed as I had high expectations for this sunscreen and I live in Miami.
Good, fast ship
The 55 made me break out. I threw it away and went back to the 30spf same brand.
Nice product!!!
very good
I just got it today, but when I look at the expire day, its 6months later. And!!!it looks like it had been used before....the seal is gone, and there is some lotion seep. I won't buy it from you again.
Only received one
Didnt get what was advertised
Feels like my skin is on fire when I apply this.  Horrible. Made me breakout too
I got three pimples from using it for three days. Plus I got sunburnt.
This sunscreen worked well for me, until it didn’t.One day, I put this on my face right before heading out. It stung like a MOFO. I also accidentally applied some too close to my eyelids, and boy my eyes stung like hell. I moisturize my face before putting on sunscreen and have never had a flare up while wearing sunscreen until out of nowhere I had a flare up. It sucks since Neutrogena products get hyped up so much, and this one didn’t do the job.TL;DRIf you have ECZEMA and SENSITIVE SKIN, AVOID.
Just not the right formula, but it could work for someone else's skin type.
I don't know what it is about this sunscreen but it really stings my face when I put it on. Not good for sensitive skin.
Unfortunately this was really bad for my skin. It clogged my pores and made me break out worse than I ever have in years. I can’t recommend it.
not as promised.
Still greasy, doesn’t soak into skin just sits on top.
This is still too greasy if you have oily skin. Clogs pores not breathable at all.
Leaves white residue on face.
Product I received is expiring in 6 months. The new one has 3 years shelf life.
I quit using this product after a few days because my face started to break out. Read about Neutrogena before purchasing.
Still causes acne for me.
My daughter suffers from cystic acne. She wears sunscreen year round and purchased this from a local drug store. About 10 minutes after applying she began to feel very itchy and in a few hours had blisters on her face. A few days later she used it again and the same thing happened.  I used it and immediately felt a burning sensation. I didn’t have the same reaction she did but I won’t be using this again.
broke my face out. not with just blemishes, but also an irritation type of rash
I got burned and I broke out. Super disappointed. Returned.
Broke out with these. Not happy
Expired 3 months ago. Not happy at all
It definitely didn't burn my skin (especially around the eyes) but I kept getting white heads on my chin for a couple days after! Yuck!!!
Makes me breakout
It's okay
Translate review to English
it irritates my skin
Ingredients are not good. It contains hormone disruptors.
I got this at Walmart, but I have to review this product because it is AMAZING. I have sensitive skin, and it does burn a bit around the eyes when you first put it on, but it's only slightly uncomfortable, and only for around 5 minutes. It's so worth it! It doesn't cause redness or any visible signs of irritation for me...my face actually looks calmer and more even toned after I put it on. Other facial sunscreens I've tried are Cera Ve Facial Moisturizing Lotion AM with SPF 30, and the Cetaphil Mattifiying Moisturizer. They were heavy and made my face oily. They made my skin feel hot and they burned and stung, especially upon second application (silly me). AND they both gave me a weird rash that made my skin feel rough, along with some pimples. Not Neutrogena.This is the real deal. No shine, guys! No shine or greasiness or oiliness. I'd go out and say that it's mattifying. It is truly a liquid. I turned it upside down, and it dripped out of the bottle without me squeezing it. It's white, but it spreads easily and becomes clear. It absorbs very quickly.  I can't wait to put it on in the morning, and I have to stop myself from putting it on at night. My skin feels baby soft after I smooth it on my face. It's silky! It's honestly probably the silicones, but I don't care. Let's just stop and talk about how great my face looks after wearing this everyday for two weeks. I have combination skin that is usually quite dry in some areas, but also oily in the T zone with some weird bumps, blackheads and the occasional pimple. This sunscreen has made my face permanently super soft, and it cleared up the bumps I had on my skin (which I think were keratosis pilaris, and which I have struggled with for a long time). I had redness that also disappeared...this sunscreen seems to have a brightening effect. Guys, I had some fine lines starting , and they're gone too. Reading the ingredients, I don't really see how it's giving me all these benefits, but it is. I'm moisturized, not flaky, and I even have fewer blackheads. It's craziness. If you're usually not satisfied with how matte your sunscreens are, or if you're sensitive to most chemical facial sunscreens, you should try this out. It's a winner for me. When it runs out, I'm buying another bottle. I have only one complaint, that I don't think it's actually waterproof. I swim and it runs into my eyes...it does sting. But it's still the greatest non-shiny facial sunscreen that you can actually wear without having to cover up with makeup.
I tried this since it is new and claims to be matte.  For the past three years, I have been very loyal to the Ultra Sheer Liquid SPF 70 formula (US), which I love bc I think it really disappears into the skin and leaves no shine on the surface (perfect under make-up, too).  You should see my review of the Ultra Sheer -- I should be a freaking spokes person, I think it's so great...  Having said that, I find Clear Face (CF) to be JUST AS GOOD.  I will write a breakdown of the products in an easy-to-read form:- Liquid light texture: BOTH feel liquid light on the skin and disappear completely, leaving no shiny residue.  Both are easy to wear under make-up, however I find the CF rolls-up into those pesky balls when you rub it in a lot.  This doesn't happen to me every time, so I'm thinking it may be when I layer too many serums and lotions underneath.  When I use CF on its own, this doesn't happen.  So, it may be the layering or the serums themselves that are the problem.  This has never been a problem with US.  Note, CF feels a tad thicker in the hand, but disappears just as finely as the US liquid.- Finish: BOTH are completely matte.  I wear sunscreen every day, like a good girl (!!!), and I wear both under make-up and alone with ZERO grease problems.  I have combination skin, but I think all skin types would like this "next to nothing" look.- Reactions: I don't have very sensitive skin, but it does easily dry-out if I use acne products on a pimple I get every now and then.  Both CF and US are chemical sunscreens.  That doesn't bother me, but I know some people can't tolerate that.  If that's an issue for you, try the Pure&Free versions (very good physical sunscreens, but they leave a slight white cast).- Price: These are about the same price, but the CF is 3 oz. while the US is 1.4 oz.To be honest, I'm not sure why they launched CF when it is a dupe (albeit more affordable) version of US.  I think that with the new FDA regulations that came out (e.g. can't claim to be more than 50+ SPF, can't be called sunblock, etc.), Neutrogena might be phasing out the US in favor the new CF?  The ingredients lists are very similar, with the major ingredients being nearly identical.  It's a bit confusing to me from a consumer/marketing perspective.  Hope this is useful.
Unfortunately, it burns my skin.
This facial sunscreen is the truth. This sunscreen does not feel oily as soon as it soaks in it doesn't look/feel like anything is there. I have searched high and low for a good facial sunscreen as i have extremely acne prone skin and this sunscreen is wonderful.
First Amazon review ever (I think...)!!! I didn't buy this on Amazon, but now that I've tried it and know it's sold here, I will. I have VERY VERY VERY VERY oily skin. The kind of skin that you powder excessively at 7 AM and is completely oily by 9 AM. Nothing has ever worked at controlling the oil, and I doubted anything ever would. I bought this just because I thought it wouldn't exacerbate the oiliness of my skin. Lo and behold it actually mattifies my skin more than any product ever has. I don't need to powder again until about noon, five hours is a lot for someone with skin as oily as mine. Granted I am quite shiny by then, but not as shiny as I am without anything on my skin. I do really enjoy it, it's only been a couple of weeks, but I'll keep using it and update this if anything changes! Oh, my skin is prone to acne as well, but I've noticed no new breakouts while using this product.
To be honest I didn't buy it here, I bought it at Wal-Mart.I have really sensitive combination skin with acne. Most things make me break out. I bought a sunblock moisturizer from Aveeno but it was making me break out. I researched the best brand of sunblocks and Neutrogena was rated first by most pharmacists.It does not feel like most sunblock, all thick and greasy and gross. This feels very thin and creamy and feels like it dissolves and blends in very fast and almost effortlessly. So far my skin has not had any extra breakouts. This lotion makes my skin feel very soft and smooth. I've never had a sunblock like it. I really enjoy it. I would give it 5 stars but it does irritate my eyes sometimes but I think every sunblock will do that.I would definitely buy it again!
Matte finish on my face when spread; disappears and gets absorbed by my skin easily after a minute. I like that the consistency is not too thick nor is it too thin. It is not harmful and is not irritating to my skin. I am usually sensitive to products and I usually feel the burning sensation from others but this did not do that to me. If anything, it would probably burn if there are openings on your skin. Also, I like that it is non-comedogenic, which means it does not clog the pores.If there is one thing that I would like for this product to improve on is it's little smell. IT DOES NOT SMELL A LOT, but it does smell. Actually, I was first amazed when I first opened it and smelled the opening because I thought that I wasn't smelling anything...however, when I smeared it on my face, I started smelling just a little sunscreen smelling cream. Don't get me wrong, it does not smell as bad as the other products but this one still has the smell. I just want to get it out there so people won't expect that this has zero smell. If I would rate the smell from 1 to 10, 10 being too strong of a smell; I'd say this is at 2. So yeah, not bothering at all.This product is a chemical sunscreen, and if you are a follower of skincare you know that there are two types of sunscreens: chemical and physical. This Neutrogena sunscreen is chemical and therefore needs to go before your moisturizer. It needs to touch the skin to activate. Physical sunscreens are the ones that could go ON TOP of your moisturizer. Both have their pros and cons, and I just feel it needs to be mentioned that this one is a chemical sunscree; and by as science dictates, it needs to go on your skin as the first layer (after cleansing/washing of course) before your other facial products.Go ahead and try this. I do recommend this.(PS:[...]Thank you.)
It is good as an emergency resource.
My face stings every time I’ve used this. No skin conditions that I am aware of previously. I use other brands and my face is fine.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
I've been using this product for about two years now. I had stopped using sunscreen on my face because of my breakouts. But since using this product, I feel more confident on using it daily. I wear it under makeup, when I run and on my hands.It's on the dry side so I use it with my normal moisturizer and it works just fine. The only thing that I don't like is the smell, it definitely has a "chemical" smell to it.This is great product for the price. It's something I will always have in my makeup bag.
So far I've only used this product once.The feel is nice, not too oily, not too dry, you basically don't really feel it which is important as I've experience a lot of other sticky and oily feels with sunblock. The smell is not bad, it's nothing fancy like citrus or strawberry etc... It just smells like sunblock, but the smell is not overpowering either, it disappears after a little bit. I would recommend.
Doesn't leave a greasy feel or texture - though I dust it with loose powder before I use my powder compact foundation.  I haven't gotten a sunburn while using this - though I use it for day to day life when I'm going to be spending time outside - not for the pool or beach.
I have not experienced any pore-clogging like I did with another Neutrogena Sunscreen I used.I am a woman of color with toffee skin tone and did not experience an white cast, my daughter has chestnut/dark chocolate tone and did have a cast however.
A little greasy and not very moisturizing but that's okay since it's a sunscreen not a moisturizer. Amazing sun protecion and overall great.
I like this product because it doesn’t cause my acne-prone skin to breakout and doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin, I just wish it was matte and came in an Spf 70 or spf 100.
Doesn't work for me was a face sunscreen since I have oily skin; BUT a similar consistency, finish, and smell to the $20 Rosay-Poche Athelios sunscreens.  Might be a good inexpensive alternative!
I had the same lotion, but with SPF 110.Pros:- non greasy- doesn't cause acne- doesn't smell like sunscreen- acts as a primer under my makeupCons:- really thick- burns eyes if contact occurs- melts off with sweat/ water, not for exercise.I thoght this lotion was perfect until I took a break from jogging yesterday to use the restroom and looked in the mirror to see I was sweating white water off of my face! This conserns me because not only did I loose the sun protection but I looked like a weirdo in front of these cute guys jogging shirtless. *sigh* life is so unfair.
I love this sunscreen! I'm very fair toned and get the occasional breakout, like those big one or two pimples at a time that take up a good majority of your cheek or nose kind of breakouts.. the big honkers if you will. I slather a pretty moderate amount of this on my face after I cleanse and moisturize and kind of pat it in real good. It takes away the shine of my moisturizer and gives me a matte finish that makes you ready to go even without foundation! (I don't have the oiliest of skin, mind you). I love that it has such a high SPF, it keeps sunburns at bay when I'm out for a long bike ride or a walk with the dog. The first day I used this sunscreen I put this on my face, shoulders, neck, and back, and went for a bike ride and the got a mild burn on my arms (of course the one place I didn't put it). I considered it a good test for functionality of the product. So, you don't always have to use it on your face, it is a sunscreen so you can put it where ever, but i suppose if you're prone to back acne or chest acne this would probably be a good suite for you to use in those areas as well. This product has never broke me out, even when you start to sweat. I will be repurchasing this product for sure.
This doesn't feel greasy and is pretty good for my sensitive skin
I WOULD give it 5 stars, but the one thing that would make it perfect would be if it mattified. It doesn't mattify. My face is oily and this doesn't control it. But my face doesn't breakout so that's what I care about!
For protection against the sun since, even in winter, it is important to protect your skin against skin cancer.  Mine had expired, so decided it was easier and less time-consuming to buy it on Amazon.  As far as moisturizing goes, it has a dry feel since I have oily skin and it does not leave your skin feeling oily.
Am early 50's.  Skin is drying out and wrinkling due to age, but also has breakouts (how lame is that!?).  Have tried many sunscreens for my face and neck, and even end up using kid's, heavy-greasy, SPF30 when I have nothing else.  BUT!  I stumbled across Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30 sunblock, and now I'll use nothing else for my face and neck.  The lotion is lightweight and spreads easily, and is not greasy, oily, or shiny.  Dries into my skin quickly.  Has the standard "sunscreen" smell (which they probably could do better on... which is why it got only 4stars) - but is not bad.  Package is small (for my purse and car glove box).  Cap lid closes tightsly (no sunscreen explosions!).  And after months of use, NO BREAKOUTS.  Love this product!
I bought this after reading good reviews on amazon. It doesnt leave those nasty looking white stuff on your face once you apply it on or makes your face looking greasy afterwards. It's like a light moisturizer. This also didnt break out my sensitive face like it claimed to be but the only downside is that stings my face a bit right after I put in on my face.
Extremely
I have oily/combination skin that’s become super prone to breakouts. This formula is easy to put on and there’s no shine. I especially like how it gives my skin a matte look and feel. It’s rare that I find exactly what I’m looking for when it comes to my skin.
It has silicon thats why cause acneDont use it If you have acne
This is my go to sunscreen and moisturizer.  Does not cause any breakouts or sensitivity.  Tried others, always come back.  Use this everyday under my makeup.
LOVE this sunscreen. I don't know if this has any scientific basis, but it seems to me that I stay lighter with this sunscreen on under the glare of the sun, rather than tan if i don't wear it. It's just a personal preference because my facial skin goes a weird orangey shade in the summer otherwise that I'm not fond of. Additionally, like the name suggests, NO BREAKOUTS and no heavy or greasy feel. I wear it under my makeup as a primer, because of how moisturizing it is.
It doesn't make my skin feel oily like others, it's easy to spread and doesn't make me look like a ghost. It also doesn't make me break out.
Dries quickly, has a matte finish. Great texture, not greasy at all!
I'm really impressed with this product. It actually lived up to my expectations. I can apply Clear Face SPF 30 fairly liberally, and it still dries to a matte, nongreasy, nonsticky finish. I can easily apply mineral powder over it without the makeup grabbing. Just be sure to wait about 15 minutes for the product to dry. Clear Face has hardly any smell. And although I'm prone to clogged pores (I'm in my mid 40s), my complexion hasn't worsened since I've started using this sunscreen, which is amazing. I usually can't put any creams or lotions on my face without seeing an increase in bumpiness. I highly recommend this and will buy it again. Note: I always have a problem with sunscreens running into my eyes. I find that by skipping my temples, I don't really have that problem anymore. You can use powder with SPF on that area instead.
Great sunscreen lotion for me! If your scared of skin reactions just apply a pea size on your arm, wait awhile and see if you have a reaction or itching
Was happy that this product does exactly what it says. it is also oil free and disappears into the skin in seconds leaving no annoying white marks. Very good for acne prone skin.
I have combination, caucasian skin and since this sunscreen uses chemical (rather than physical) blockers, it goes on my skin every single morning as the very first product before my primer and makeup.  For most of the year it's moisturizing enough to wear in place of a regular face lotion, though I still use a high quality night cream.  It feels light and non-greasy as long as you make sure to give it a few minutes to absorb before applying other products. This costs several times less the "designer" sunscreens that you'd get at a department store beauty counter or dedicated cosmetics store like Sephora.  The only small drawback is that if I'm working up a SERIOUS sweat outside during the summer, it can sting my eyes just a tiny bit, though that will happen with almost any product.
My biggest worry with sunscreen for the face is the white residue it can leave. This sunscreen doesn't leave anything once rubbed in! Is great protection, especially for everyday wear. Would definitely recommend.
I'm currently using a mix of actives to fight my acne (benzoyl peroxide, Retin-a) so I was looking for something that wouldn't make me break out too obviously, and a lower SPF for indoor quarantine use, but this stuff is not good for sensitive skin. It burned slightly when I put it on and leaves skin feeling dry, even with using a moisturizer first. If you're currently using actives to fight another skin issue and need something super gentle, this is not a good bet.
This is the only facial sunscreen I've ever used that doesn't cause breakouts. It also makes the skin matte which lasts all day and reduces the shine on oily skin. However, this product is so incredibly drying that I can't really even use it as a daily sunscreen which is what I bought it for in the first place. I guess it does sort of depend on your skin type but I have extremely oily, acne-prone skin and this made my skin visibly dry and scaly within a week. It's a good sunscreen, but be wary of how drying it can be.
Edit: 10/15/19 - I’m taking two stars off because this pills. If I touch my face at all during the day I am a flakey mess! I really like it for the first couple of hours until it “dries down”. Oh well. I usually give my failed sunscreens away to my lighter friends.I am African American and I have struggled to find a good drugstore SPF for my face that doesn’t pill or leave a white cast. This is it. It’s a chemical sunscreen so I think that has something to do with it. I will definitely be repurchasing!
I did not buy this at Amazon but I love it so much I had to write a review and my recommendations. First:  I have had very oily/acne-prone skin all my life. My skin is also very fair, and sensitive, and I live in South Florida. Non-chemical sunscreens are too thick and make me break out. Most chemical sunscreens are too oily AND they burn my sensitive skin, especially at high SPFs. I find that with care (using a very mild cleanser) this product protects my skin from the sun, while making it matte and oil-free for hours and hours without causing any breakouts. It's great under foundation and I don't have to blot or touchup all day, while a lot of other primers and sunscreens (even so-called matte ones) cause a major grease-attack. I love to experiment with new products, but I am sold on this one. The appearance on your skin is natural, smooth, and looking a just-washed matte.To recap:  is your skin oily yet sensitive? BUY THIS IN SPF 30. Wear it every day. Even if you have darker skin or live in a less-than-tropical climate. Skin cancer is no fun. I have had small pre-cancers removed - with either freezing it or cauterizing. Yes, it hurts as much as it sounds. The freezing left me with white scars and the cauterizing with pink marks which lasted for months. Skin cancer hurts, skin cancer is ugly, and skin cancer kills. Don't be a victim.
Great product and fast shipping
This sunscreen is the only one I've found that has not made me break out or irritated my skin, even though I have tried more expensive sunscreens by LaRoche Posay and Andalou Naturals. It is light enough to use with oily skin and has a slight mattifying effect. I have medium brown skin and although it does cast a white tint on my face on initial application, I feel that it sinks in sufficiently after half an hour so that it's not longer noticeable. It is the only physical non-tinted sunscreen that does not cast a long-lasting white tint on my face.
My absolute favorite sunscreen.  I hate wearing sunscreen because of the oily feeling.  Not with this sunscreen.  Feels like regular face lotion.  Amazing product.
This stuff works like a dream. Sunscreen almost always gives me a rash, and this stuff left my skin in great shape. Highly recommended
i’ve been crying and tears eyed from this sunscreen for the past 3 hours. avoid getting this anywhere near your eyes- it burns it stings)’:
Best sunscreen I have found for my face! As other say, it is light, disappears on the face, and feels matte. I have acne, so I use a salicyclic treatment and a treatment to reduce scarring/ red marks-- both say that sunscreen is necessary because they make your skin more sensitive to the sun. So I love this sunscreen because, as far as I can tell, it hasn't provoked further acne.It can sting a little, and I thought it might be due to small abrasions on my skin from rough-handling*. So I became more gentle when I washed, and I used tissues to dry. After that, I felt less of a sting.*(My dermatologist acne brochure says: 'Excessive washig and scrubbing will not prevent or treat acne. Too much scrubbing can irritate your skin and make acne worse.)
I have very acne prone skin, but this doesn't cause me any breakouts at all.  I've been using it daily for years to keep my face from tanning.  (My face is really prone to darkening way faster than the rest of my body... I think it's because of the acne medication I use.)
I've used this stuff for years and it's wonderful. I used to have drier skin, but it has changed over the last few years to oily. Either case, i's been nearly impossible to find a sunscreen that won't clog my pores. I LOVE this lotion! I will probably never find something that will be 100% effective, but this is definitely the closest thing to it. I use it most days as a basic sunscreen, not strictly for the beach.
I would recommend this UVA and UVB protecting sunscreen to anyone and everyone i know. I recently replaced my daily moisturizer with this sunscreen and it has worked wonders. I have oily skin and acne prone skin, i also wear makeup most of the time. This sunscreen leaves me looking extremely matte, even when I've been outside in the heat for hours! It doesn't break me out or leave a white residue on my skin. This product has exceeded my expectations.
We have very sensitive skin and break out in hives with most sunscreens.  We were pleasantly surprised that we can use this sunscreen not just on our face but also our body.  California Baby was the only other sunscreen we could use before this one.  Even "sensitive" and "for babies" sunscreens don't work for us.  Love the convenience and good price overall.
I love this sunscreen. I am very acne prone and oily, this does not make my face break out even more or become more oily, it's not greasy at all. I also use it for my arms and I like that I don't feel that I have something on my skin. If you have oily skin or hate the feeling of greasy sunblock, get this one!
I love it. You look like if you have not applied anything / no greasy sensation at all
My favorite sunscreen for face.  Non-comedogenic, unscented, not greasy, not thick.  Perfect product in my book.  I've tried others and came back to this.  It's my second tube and I'll not be buying anything else as long as this is available.
I love this product
As a dark skinned person wanting to wear more sunscreen more often *and* not wanting to walk around with a layer of white on my face, I'm currently buying and returning many many products like this that advertise as being sheer on "all skin types". If you have dark brown skin, save yourself the trouble and stay away from this. My default over the past few months has been Black Girl Sunscreen (leaves absolutely NO cast) but it leaves my skin greasier than I'd like so I'm trying to find an alternative.
Some of the best oil free face sun screen.
This is one of the few that doesn't irritate my skin and make me break out. I have really sensitive skin with rosacea. It doesn't even make me break out when I apply it before running. The sweat and everything normally irritates my skin to no end. This product seems to be very mild yet effective.
I wanted a sunscreen above SPF 30 that I could wear daily, but I hate the greasy feeling and oily shine that most sunscreens leave. I also wanted something that wouldn't make my dry skin flake! For a while I had been using
I ordered it as it has good reviews, but sadly, it turned out to be gone off, smells like a expired dairy! Of course, I'll never buy it! Save your money!
I finally found a sunscreen that doesn't make me feel like I have lotion on my face. My skin is extremely oily, and I can't stand to put any sort of lotion on it. My dermatologist has been getting on me about using a sunscreen on my face, though, so I tried this product in hopes that it would work for me. I absolutely love it and wear it every day. It absorbs immediately after applying and does not feel like you have anything on your face. I've not had any noticeable sun exposure since I started using it, and I sweat like crazy when in the hot sun. I highly recommend it for all skin types, but for those with oily skin it's a godsend!
I read the reviews for the lotion online and I bought this from my local Duane Reade in my area. Not a fan of the price cause it runs like 12 bucks, but it's definitely 12 bucks well spent.I have terrible oily skin, especially on my nose. My nose is the most shiny even without applying anything to my face. I've tried aveeno, st. Ives, olay, clean and clear, dove, cetaphil, biore, and so many more face lotions but THIS, I can say for the first time in my life, I've found something that does not leave that greasy, shiny residue look. Not right after I apply, not 30 mins after I apply, and not 5 hours later either. Finally I have a matte look w/ a moisturized feel and the protection to boot.I am very happy I found this and I would recommend it for oily skin types.
I usually have clear skin, but anytime I wear sunscreen I break out in little bumps all over my face.  Using this product, I get no bumps or irritation.  I am very fair skinned and prone to burn, but this works as advertised.  I wore it in the Bahamas, on a day when it was hotter than Hades and was walking around outside for several hours on a tour.  It stayed on despite the sweating.  Neutrogena sunscreen is the best and this is no exception.
Met expectations
This product burned the eyes while swimming. It also stung when I put it on my face. It did prevent sunburn but my face still  broke out pretty badly.
The only facial sunscreen that works for my skin without feeling oily or too dry.
The smell reminds me of paint. Not sure it's any better that my normal sunscreen when preventing breakouts. Not worth the extra money or carrying around two sunscreens.
I have spent hundreds upon hundreds of dollars trying to find an SPF for my face that would not cause my severe acne to flair up. My dermatologist told me this was great and should try it.I LOVE IT!! That you neutrogena!
I love it
We love this sunscreen for our faces. Provides excellent protection without giving face a greasy look/feel
I was so scared to try an everyday face sunscreen because my skin is so oily and prone to breakouts, along with being sensitive. However, this stuff is great. It doesn't make me shiny, even under a full face of makeup. I wore it on a trip where I got more sun in a week than I've had in the last year. I didn't get a bit of sunburn, or any color at all. I will buy this sunscreen again and again.
I finally found a sunscreen I like! I needed a sunscreen I could wear while attending a three-day outdoor event. I wanted to be able to wear make-up over it, and be able to reapply it without making a mess or feeling sticky. I also have very sensitive skin. This sunscreen was perfect! I skipped my regular (non-sunscreen) moisturizer and used the Neutrogena Clear Face instead. It rubbed in easily, didn't leave my skin looking white and ghostly, and dried to a matte finish. After a few minutes, I could put my face powder right over it and I never felt like I was wearing sunscreen. Hardly any scent at all, no skin irritation, no shine. This is the one to buy if you've been frustrated with greasy-feeling or smelly sunscreens.
Excellent product
Let's just say that normal sunscreen burns, breaks me out, makes me feel like my skin is under attack. Gone for really expensive, aggressive Sunscreens in the past to protect face, and I've tried......really tried for 4/5yrs - and one day, I walk into walmart, look @ this product, remember that growing up, I never had a single problem with Neutrogena, even with my oily t-zone, and dry "rest of the face" - I picked this product.Its been 3 weeks now, no spots, no break outs. Hell, I don't even remember I have it on. Even sleep with it on........  You don't know how bad I've wanted this - so it's great "finally" to have something for protection.As a side effect, it finishes with a "matte" feel, so the oil production is reduced.So acne prone, sensitive faced people like me, be happy. Be very happy.
I purchased this from a chain-store - not Amazon. I adore it. It is effective; non-greasy; it does not make me break out; the scent does not linger; it does not contain zinc oxide therefore it does not give my skin a white caste; it is the only chemical sunscreen I have tried that does not sting or itch; it feels light; and the finish on my skin is pleasing with or without makeup. I now consider it a must-have for me.
This is the only sunscreen lotion that doesn't make my skin itchy.
Did not get sunburnt and did not break out. Love this sunscreen!
I'm ordering this from Amazon because I can't find it in a store any longer. I used this last summer and loved it. It is non-greasy, leaves no visible residue, and does not make my face break out. The other Neutrogena sunscreens are good, but this one is the best for me.
Makes me break out and my face pasty white.  And I live in AZ.  Watery.
The sunblock works but it runs down too easy with sweat and then burn my eyes.  Also, I needed to reply too often to really enjoy the pool. I prefer to use the stick bars.
After using this product for a few days, my skin became extremely dry. I had to switch to a more gentle face wash and facial serums while my skin barrier healed. If you have dry sensitive, I would look for a different sunscreen.
I don't have acne, am over 50, and think this sunscreen is Neutrogena's best yet (and I've tried them all including the baby versions).  Within seconds of applying, you have a smooth, matte finish that's either ready-to-go or ready for make-up.The texture of this sunscreen leans towards that of a liquid but it is not as runny as their Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunblock which I thought was very runny and messy (and shiny!)  I have only used the Clear Face spf 30 so far but have the Clear Face spf 50 to try now that summer is here.  I'm wondering if the higher spf might translate into a shinier finish...
This ruined my skin. I've never had bad acne and this caused my forehead to break out in hive like little bumps all over it!! It's terrible acne, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.
I have bought this product quite a few times. I wear sunscreen every day, but I also suffer from oily, acne-prone skin. This sunscreen is truly THE best. It goes on smoothly, and it leaves no shine behind at all. I do not believe I have ever broken out from this sunscreen. Plus, makeup goes on top of it perfectly - it works just as well as any other moisturizer under makeup. And it protects from the sun well. I put this on my face and my boyfriend's during an all-day music festival in the dead of summer (it was 97 degrees that day) and neither of us got sun-burnt (we reapplied often of course)!
The COSDNA profile on this sunscreen looked pretty safe for sensitive skin. I was heading to a pool party and decided to take it for a test run. It pilled a bit when applying, felt slightly heavy/greasy, and left a small amount of white cast (but not nearly the amount of a mineral sunscreen). Within 4 hours, I began feeling some tingling/itching around my chin. When I finally went to wash my face after the party, my chin was broken out in about ten small blisters and the rest of my face was flushed red. Sensitive skin users should absolutely patch test!I would take white cast over this reaction any day! Back to Innisfree's No Sebum sunscreen.
Most sunscreens cause my face to break out and they feel greasy to boot. This stuff keeps my skin clear, doesn't dry my skin but feels powder dry to the touch.  Great alone or under make-up. I keep a tube in my purse all the time.
I have very dry skin so I made sure I have lotion on before putting on the Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen.  It works as intended protected my face from the sun.  However after a week of daily use, my face becomes irritated.  All of my facial skin still stings badly even after I'd stopped using the sunblock for 3 days now.
BURNS EVERYONE!! DO NOT BUY!!Called Neutrog.'s customer service today for refund. Took our kids hiking with another family, before heading out we all applied sunscreen. Within seconds, everyone was complaining of burning faces, men included. We compared sunscreen tubes and discovererd we had both bought the same Neutrogena Clear Skin Spf 55 sunscreen. Sad to see hundreds of bad reviews online (CVS, Target, Amaz, Walmart...) discussing same burning problem & these reviews are over a year old. Neutrogena has clearly been made aware of this issue and has done nothing to rectify it. I purchase this Neutrogena products monthly and use daily, and will stop buying everything if they keep this harmful formula on the market. Neutrogena is a Johnson & Johnson brand.
Great! Not greasy at all...absorbs quickly.  Love this!!
I've used this product for years, bought a fresh bottle a couple of days ago. For the first time, this product totally bombed for me. It made me break out with huge, painful, bumpy zits that I haven't had in many years. I don't know if they changed to formula or something, but it's taking forever for my skin to clear up even though I stopped using it. I will look for an alternative. Neutrogena- if you cheaped out some ingredient, go fix it now.
I really wanted to like this product. I have very fair, acne-prone, skin. I put it on 20 minutes before going bike riding. It proceeded to melt into my eyes and burn my face. It works fine if you aren't sweating or going into the water.
Finally, a sunscreen for the face that feels clean and doesn't leave a sticky mess!! It feels a little sticky at first, but it absorbs into the skin nicely, but after about 5 minutes, you forget that you put anything on!
my foundation only had spf 6, not enough. tried several different moisturizers with higher spf and they all made my face too oily, causing makeup to wear off faster and causing me to break out. then i came across this awesome product and now i have found what i have been looking for for so long! Perfect consistency, non-greasy. DOES NOT MAKE MY FACE PRODUCE OIL AND PROTECTS ME FROM SUN!!! thanks neutrogena for an awesome product!! the advertisement is true: you finally dont have to choose between clear skin and sun protection!
Burns my face.  I had used this product for years.  Along with the newer packaging, I assume is a new formula.  I finished the last of the old tube 2 days ago.  Yesterday and today my eyes and face burn until I wash this off.  I just now ordered Aveeno.  It gets good reviews with claims of no burning.
My skin breaks out after using it...but it might be just my sensitive skin.
I really wanted to like this product. It applies like a dream, and goes great under make-up. However, it burns my skin horribly. I have acne prone skin. It makes it sting and causes under the skin, cystic break outs for me. I think I am allergic to one of the chemical sunscreen ingredients.My boyfriend loves it though. He never gets acne at all!Depends on the person and skin type
Totally love it!
I just got mine today, it was the last one in the store. It must be popular? idk anyways the other sunscreens by neutrogena stung my sensitive acne prone face a bit, but this one barely tingled :) I love how it has such a high spf but has such a light texture! such a breeze to apply and it doesn't feel heavy either! I almost can't believe its really spf 50! I think this may be the best sunscreen I've ever used!!! oh and the flip top cap is really convenient. BUT i'd like a pump...
The lotion feels so good,really dries matte which is important for my oily skin.
I would not buy it again!
I struggle to keep my skin clear and have had NO issues whatsoever with this product.  I am really happy to have found something that works!
Light smell, not whitening and very light.
I have used many sunscreens over the years and don't even have sensitive skin, but hoo boy. This stuff really burns. I even awaited 20 minutes to see if it would subside but I had to wash it off.According to other reviews I am not the only non sensitive that had a reaction to this. Please do a spot test before applying. This stuff hurts.
Great product for the face. It goes on great before foundation (primer) and is non greasy and absorbs easily too.
I have a major breakout every time I use this! Of course everyone’s skin is different but it’s frustrating that the product says it won’t cause breakouts and it does. However, the sun protection is good and it’s easily easy to rub in.
Full disclaimer, I didn't buy the product, but I did read the list of ingredients which clearly listed oxybenzone despite the title of the product which says it's supposed to be oxybenzone free.
I’ve never had this happen before, but when I put this on, my skin became extremely itchy and uncomfortable. It’s so red and I have no idea how to fix it. I don’t recommend.
I really like the fact that this is a sunblock designed for acne prone skin...HOWEVER, I find that it doesn't really mattify skin or keep oil at bay, which are two major things for me. Usually after I apply it my skin looks pretty shiny and feels a little sticky-ish. This sunscreen is more on the runny-ish side and does have a stronger 'sunscreen' scent when it first goes on, but it dissipates fairly quickly. I don't consider myself to be someone who has sensitive skin, but this sometimes stings my face a bit when I apply it. I'm not quite sure why this is, but it could be that I exfoliated too much or my skin is on the drier side in some areas. This sunblock does make good on its promise not to break you out, and it does have a light feel for a sunscreen. I usually wait ten minutes before I apply any makeup, just to make sure it's fully absorbed. It doesn't pill up when I accidentally rub or itch my face, which is also nice. I probably won't repurchase this, I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Elta MD sunscreen, but I'm thinking I should have just shelled out the ten extra bucks for the better product.
This product claims to not cause breakouts but that is exactly what happened to me. I do not have acne-prone skin and have not broken out badly in my life until I used this product. I do not recommend purchasing this. My sister also experienced a similar break out Due to this product.
I have oily/combination, acne-prone skin and wanted to like this product. I tried it on a clean face, with and without a moisturizer, but every time it still burned my face. I wouldn't recommend it for sensitive skin, although based on the other reviews it's worked for some.
This caused a rash on my cheeks after one day of use. I am not acne prone and have never had an allergic reaction to a sunscreen. After one day of use my cheeks started to burn and I developed scaly, itchy bumps 24 hours later. My friends who also used it had similar reactions, along with face swelling and severe sneezing. I highly recommend testing this on a patch of your skin before using in the sun. I do not have sensitive skin so this reaction was extremely out of the ordinary.
Caused me to break out with whiteheads after only one use in spite of following it up with face wash and exfoliating.  If you’re looking for non-comedogenic sunscreen, look elsewhere.
I would give this a zero rating if I could. This sunscreen literally left my face patchy, red and not to mention it burned like crazy. For someone who’s never had acne or any difficulties with my skin this was very disappointing to encounter!!
Excellent product!!! :D
I've been using Neutrogena Face Sunblock on my face for years but I always break out from it. I thought I would give the clear face product a try. OMG... it burns like crazy!! I like the actual product. It goes on thin and clean and doesn't create a build up like the regular Neutrogena does, but I can't get over the initial burning it does to my face. I have very sensitive skin so I thought maybe that was why. I made my husband try it who doesn't have sensitive skin at all. He was screaming! It honestly burns your face so bad. It's like putting alcohol on an open cut! I wasted my money on this product and Neutrogena let me down!!
This is great for people who have oily skin and do not want to feel like they are wearing anything on their face.  It absorbs so well and feels so light that you will not want to put another sunscreen on your face ever again!  This just feels great and light and has great protection.  I am glad I tried this one!
oh my god I have never had such a bad allergic reaction to anything in my life. The irony is it's "break out free." I have SLE lupus and was on vacation and they did not have the brand I like available so I picked this up. After going swimming I reapplied this on my face and my whole face started BURNING , stinging and got red immediately. Adding soap did nothing. Water burned. It felt like it was a chemical burn. I've been dealing with a horrible rash and outbreak all over my face for 3 days after using this and had to get a steroid cream. This stuff is trash with horribleIngredients.
So I actually bought this at Walmart rather than amazon but I wanted to leave a review to warn you guys of possible contact dermatitis. From looking at the ingredients I think that either the cinnamon or cedrus atlantica bark extract is to blame. Both are basically astringents but can also be sensitizing to the skin, and I’m pretty sure were the cause of the rash that appeared around my eyes the next morning after using it. This may not happen to everyone but just beware that it can cause an allergic reaction.
I've never had cystic acne in my life but I had it after I used this. It may still work for you. I guess my face just hates any kind of sunscreen.
with all of the wwarning about the sun-we must take care of our skin.This produce is not greasy and applies easily.No offensive odor.
I was looking for something that doesn't make a white streak. This one spread easily and doesn't make a streak. Love this item.
excellent
After using this suncreen for the past three years, I had a reaction over the weekend. What looked like a minor sunburn has turned into hives and little blisters on my neck, chest, and back the morning after a day at the beach. Kind of a bummer because this worked for me for many years. Be careful using this.
Didn’t work, I got burnt on my face!
It burned my skin when I put it on. This sunscreen is just not for sensitive skin. It didn't pill, wasn't heavy feeling and didn't leave a white cast on my skin. It just turned my skin bright red. I'll have to try out the sensitive skin edition.
This thing stings my face like crazy, and the sensation lasted a white. Very disappointed.
I was so hopefully about this product! I have been looking for AGES to find a sunscreen that doesn't make you break out worse after using it. Unfortunately, I must be allergic to something in this, because this caused me to have a horrible, itchy, bumpy rash all over my face, chin, neck, and ears (where I used it). The itchiness is driving me CRAZY. My skin didn't get burned while using this, but I caution others to try it out on a small patch of skin first for a day or two before using as your normal sun screen. Trust me, a few more pimples from your normal sunscreen while testing this product somewhere else is MUCH better than the torture that is this rash all over your face for days...
After loving the Ultra Sheer version of this product for my arms, neck, back, etc., I thought I'd give the Clear Face version of this a try. Much to my dismay, my husband and I both felt a lot of strong stinging sensation on our faces. We had no obvious face irritation (he hadn't just shaved, and I hadn't washed/exfoliated my face that day) and were shocked at how much discomfort this sunscreen caused! We had to reapply a couple of times since we were at a long baseball game, and we experienced the same stinging sensation every time. My husband does admittedly have sensitive skin, but mine has never had any problems. I'm not sure what ingredient could be causing the irritation, especially since I have never had trouble with Neutrogena products before. I will be sticking to the regular Ultra Sheer for my body and look for something gentler for my face.
While I loved the liquidy texture of this spf and the feel of it on my skin, after an hour of use my skin had rough itchy patches of red for a couple of days. My skin is sensitive and this unfortunately is not a good formula for it.
I took a chance on such a reputable Neutrogena product this summer and it has caused me to break out and I never have breakouts. For 8 years I have used Obagi sunscreen with zinc but since it's $26 a bottle and Summer in Texas, I am applying 2-3 times a day and wanted to have a quality backup face moisturizer for the afternoons and evenings. There are 4 different sunscreen ingredients so I have no idea which one causes it but I am very disappointed in this product. (My skin is very normal and I have never had significant problems with any facial products.)
I didn't get a burn on my skin while wearing this, but OUCH my eyes burned!! The slightest sweat or seaspray made my eyes burn for hours. Tried 3 different times and all 3 times I wore it my eyes burned!! OUCH!
I have acne prone skin and I thought this would be the perfect sunblock since it said 'clear skin' but it broke me out... Also, I'm using retin a and thought this would protect my skin in the sun and it honestly didn't do a thing as far as sun protection...
This made my undereyes burn like hell when I first put it on. Sooo disappointing because I heard so many good things about this product and was really excited to try it. Idk if this was a faulty product or if they're all like this?
Every time I use this sunscreen, I am usually at the pool. I run it on my face and it works great. But then after I get out of the pool to reapply after about 2 hours, it burns VERY bad. I have read many articles on how Neutrogena sunscreens have lots of chemicals and toxins in them, and the pool I go to is chlorine. I am just assuming that after having the chlorine on your face, and putting this sunblock on, somehow the sunscreen reacts with the chlorine in the water and burns REALLY bad for about 30-45 minutes. My 2 sisters and 1 friend have used this and complained about how it burns them too, so I don't think the problem is my skin. I have used this sunblock for about 2 months and threw it out 2 days ago. I hope this review is helpful to you. :)
So, I bought this whole at the beach because I have fairly sensitive skin and I had gotten a slight burn the day before from just using my normal sunscreen. After applying it, I then got to experience a burning sensation that was absolutely horrid. I would have preferred no sun screen and a sun burn over this feeling. It wasn't greasy, as it claimed, but it left my face feeling like I had poured alcohol over a fresh wound for several hours. I will never use or buy this product again.
My 8 year old has had a huge reaction to this product twice! At first I thought is was the chlorine in the pool. The 2nd time I use it, it happened again.  She has developed huge blisters and red patches on her face from using this product. She has been in a lot of pain!!!  I do not recommend for children or people with sensitive skin.
Contrary to the label it made my skin very oily and  broke me out really bad. I had small little white pimples and red rash I've never seen before in my life. I do not recommend it, it is not worth ruining your skin.
Good texture and even application- but it burns terribly- and continues to burn hours after application. Would not recommend - I don’t even have sensitive skin!
I originally used Neutrogena's original sensitive skin sun screen and that was great but made my face feel oily.  So I switched to this product, the Clear Face version, and my skin broke out like it hasn't since I was a teenager!  Now I use Ocean Potion Clear Zinc Oxide face sunscreen and I don't break out or feel oily.
since this only available on Fresh Cart, I will buy it elsewhere. last week it was a football mouthpiece. amazon thinks they are locking us in, but ill go elsewhere
I'm so broke out from this product!  Once again, I tried a sunblock that is supposed to not cause zits.  Now I look like pizza face.  Seriously, I want to cry, scream, hide in my house, etc.  I can't believe this...but I'm going to get the Qing Outdoor Flap Hat sold in sporting goods on Amazon.  You have to look at this.  It's crazy AND I'm going to look crazy while mowing the lawn, but l am at the end of my rope.
Did not like it, made my face super oily. I have acne prone skin.
Bought this sunscreen for a vacation with my husband.  Developed mild/moderate sunburn and windburn on face/neck after reapplying every 2 hours.  After getting burned, reapplication of sunscreen the remainder of vacation resulted in severe burning sensation on both my husband and myself.  It has some ingredients which allow for quick drying, but cause a severe burning/stinging sensation on irritated skin.  Would not recommend for vacation use/heavy sun exposure but maybe as an everyday sunscreen for mild sun exposure and only if you don't have irritated skin to begin with.
Most likely would have done its job, but I took it off right away. It stung so bad, completely unbearable! I had to rinse it off with cold water, and I couldn't even see for a few minutes. I wouldn't recommend this if your skin is already burned.
Caused the worst breakout i've had in years. This was the only new skin care product used this summer so it's definitely the cause. Not matte at  all, nor does it absorb easily into the skin. If you are prone to nasty blackheads and other types of congestion, avoid at all costs.
Cause an allergy so be careful.
FEELS TOO GRITTY!!!
Worst product ever! My skin literally peeled offffff from this sunscreen! I have acne prone skin and am currently using the proactiv which dries out my skin but once i put this on my skin was peeling and this broke me out. The texture feels like water, the smell is horrible and you can still smell it once it's on. I don't like this sunscreen at all.
It immediately started a burning sensation on my face and turn it red on its first use. I will be returning to the store.
Not for sensitive and oily skin
Caused me to breakout after two applications. Definitely shouldn't use if skin is sensitive/acne prone.
My wife and I decided to try this as it is a light weight sunscreen.  This much is true, it is not as oily as other sunscreens.  We tried it at the beach in Wildwood New Jersey and we both got sunburn.  Im a pro at not getting sunburn and I reappplied after going in the ocean and after sitting out for hours.  Did not help.  We switched back to our old brand the following day and we did not get sunburn.
I keep getting burned while wearing this.
Caused a breakout on clear skin. I do not recommend.
Don't use if you have Rosacea, turned my face bright red and really itchy.
It clogged my pores and made me break out
Upon application, this made my skin burn. It also feels greasy but I find that all products with sunscreen do.
I live at almost 9000 feet, and the UV rays up here are fierce! I started using this on my face every time I go outside to hike, walk or bike, because I noticed I was starting to get the dreaded brown spots. Augh! However, with religious use of this, I haven't gotten any more. I'm not a fan of the ingredients, but other physical barriers haven't been as durable during exercise, and they also caused my pores to block. As soon as I'm back inside, I wash my face, so hopefully that helps a little.
I like this sunscreen for my oily - combination skin especially during the warmer months. It goes on easily and seems to effectively protect my very fair skin from the sun. My only wish is that it was actually clear coming out of the bottle rather than white. That being said, it doesn't leave a white cast on my skin as so many sunscreens do. It seems to moisturize without being greasy. It hasn't caused acne breakouts at all.
I have combo skin! This makes my face look oily initially if I put the customary amount. I have to put some mattifying moisturizer to not go out to the world looking like a greaseball! It does dry soft and silky thanks to the dimethicone but I feel something still missing! I will repurchase while I hunt for my holy grail sunscreen! I love the fact that it’s water resistant and affordable.
It's nice to have a sunscreen specific use for your face. It goes on really easy and it doesn't take ten minutes to rub in like the cheap stuff. A little bit goes a long way. It is not greasy at all and doesn't clog my pores and doesn't cause me to break out like so many other sunscreens do. I will keep buying. I haven't used it while running or doing outdoor activities that cause me to sweat. So in terms of sweat proof I can't say. But as for general purposes outdoors I love it.
So far the best sunscreen for face I have tried.  Goes on smoothly over other moisturizers and serums without pilling.  Protects against sunburn and doesnt feel greasy after it is applied.  I also use it to protect my tattoos on my arms, and I like that it actually is sheer and doesnt cast a weird white residue sparkle or glow on them.  I don't think it is very moisturizing by itself, but it pairs nicely over other lotions.  A little stingy if it sweats into your eyes- but not any more so than any other sunscreen would.
Love this product. I live near the beach and decided to give this brand a try for a few days. I put it on without makeup on top. It was moisturizing and blended easily. It didn't leave white streaks or stickiness.No sunburn! I did try this today under makeup. I would suggest sunscreen then powder to prevent foundation from sliding.
So far, it works for me. No smell, white or sticky residue left behind. Applies smoothly and moisturizes without looking or feeling greasy, absorbs quickly. I apply a thick layer and pat it onto my face, also apply to my neck & upper chest. No breakouts so far and makeup goes on smoothly over sunscreen. Good investment & great buy.
I used it yesterday and very shortly after applying my face started to burn and tingle. I have pretty sensitive skin but this have never happened to me before. I will give it one more shot but a bit scared now ...I like that it has high SPF and does not leave white residue so hopefully I will not react to it any more ....fingers crossed. I have melasma on my face so I need something that works  well and was so hopeful about this product.
I like this product as it is highly rated without being pricy. This is not oily, applies easy, and living in florida supports my fight against cancer
I have combination skin and this is amazing. It dries down and you don’t notice it in your skin at all. It can be a bit tricky to use if you wear makeup on top since it dries to a satin finish (not fully matte) and can rub off or make you look cakey.
First of all it burnt a bit when I put it on.Be careful not to get it in your eye it hurts bad. It aggravates my rosacea on my face & after an hour in the car I burned anyway. It works better on my arms & chest for some reason. I would not use it on the face but great for neck / chest arms if you are only going outside for an hour or so.
I use this everyday as my moisturizer. It blends evenly & doesn't leave white patches like some other sunscreens do. I love that it is not oily. I just have to not get it too close to my eyes.
Works great as stated, did not break me out which I was thankful for because most sunscreens do break me out. Doesn’t leave a white car either which is nice Nothing else to say it works great!
I loved this product and will definitely use again. Worked in the hot Florida summer with one application and plenty of ocean swimming.  Everyone liked this product that used it on our trip.
It is now one of my favorites. It gives a lot of  sun protection, also long lasting and works for any occasion.  It is not oil and does not give you greasy texture you look really good. It is easy to spread.
it’s ok but there’s a lot of white caste so i have to use very little at a time me having a somewhat darker skin complexion than most people. Also, when you sweat, the sunscreen comes off to the point where your sweat is white. the other sunscreen i used before this one (purito centella sunscreen) didn’t have any white caste and didn’t come off when i sweat. It’s ok but there’s better out there. I will definitely be returning to the purito one.
This sunscreen spreads on very easily and gives lasting protection even while playing sports in hot, humid conditions.  But what makes it even better is that I don't get white residue on everything I brush up against.  The person who details the interior of my vehicle loves it even more than I do, because now it's much easier to clean.
I like too see where I’ve applied it and then it goes invisible. It doesn’t smell like SPF and feels good on my skin.
This sunscreen is so light and quickly absorbs into the skin.  I mix it with my moisturizer in the morning, and it doesn't leave any white streaks or just sit on top of the skin like some other face sunscreen products.  Perfect.
I use this sunscreen on my face every single day! It has a nice powdery finish, is never greasy, and has never made me breakout. Love it!
Excellent sunscreen and as advertised. I've used the sheer dry one for almost two decades. Glad I decided to try this. It's even lighter which is great for my face and neck. Will continue to buy.
I was looking for a sunscreen where I can put together with my make up and this is perfect. It is sheer and it doesn’t feel like I have a sunscreen on. Even so I sweat, it doesn’t feel sticky at all.
I use this daily. I’ve bought it twice now and will continue to use. I’m African American and this does NOT make me ashy!!! Yay!
This is a great sunscreen if you have sensitive skin. It does it’s job without breaking you out, no terrible smell. I do reapply per directions.
I lovvvvve  this, inlu thing my face is greasy and I think it add to it too ( although the normal ones are extra greasy for me) but I still love it
Love this product!  Very lightweight, not greasy like other face sunscreen.
This is perfect and not greasy at all. Love how it doesn't smell bad, too.
Really good! Not so thick and feels light on face.
Non greasy. Good protection
It is great for real.
causes no breakouts for me, essentially unscented,, and it is an effective sunscreen
It is not easy to spread on your face.
Good
Really good sunscreen. Doesn't break out my face.
Works well
Best sunscreen for my skin. Non greasy.
This is always my go to because i have sensitive skin.
Great product quick shipping
It’s very good, no oil at all.
Love ❤️ it
works well
Easy to spread and non-greasy, which is the most important thing for face sunscreen.
very useful
This product claims to be "breakout free" but unfortunately that's just not true. This past year I had been experimenting with different products and FINALLY found a skincare routine that resulted in clear, glowing skin. I had been using the same routine for months and decided to try this sunscreen since it was cheaper than the one I was currently using.When I first applied it, I was honestly impressed by the lack of white cast which is so common in high SPF sunscreens. Although that feeling soon vanished as my face began to burn and itch like crazy. I should have washed it off then and there, but I really wanted to like this product so I decided to keep it on for the rest of the day. The next day my already dry skin was very irritated... My cheeks were red and I started seeing little bumps in places. Since I hadn't changed anything else in my skincare routine, it had to be a result of using the sunscreen. Maybe this sunscreen just doesn't work for dry skin? Overall I would not recommend...
It is very liquid For this don’t like me, this causes you to spread quickly.
I’m always hesitant about sunscreen for my face because I’m extremely prone to break outs. This works excellent, with no break outs.
My face is super sensitive and usually breaks out or gets red. However, this sunscreen left my face feeling smooth and worked really well on my face. The tube is a lil small but, a little goes along way and the price is not bad. I put on everymorning before i go out, seems to be working good.
This works great when I add it to my moisturizer.  What I like most is that I don’t have break outs when using it
The cream went on easily and was absorbed quickly.  I like te way my skin feels, the cream is light weight and my skin feels moisturized.
Effective sunscreen
I like this product as a sunscreen product! It’s not quite a moisturizer but if you’re looking for a facial sunscreen on top of a moisturizer then this works great!
In fact, it actually leaves my skin smoother after I wash it off than before I had put it on! I am very pale and burn very easily. I used this on my face and shoulders and didn't burn. I did gain a little bit of a shade difference, not what anyone other than someone as pale as me would call tanning, which is exactly what I was looking for. I was on a beach for about 2.5 hours, jumping in and out of the water, never reapplied, and didn't burn. Highly recommend for traditional Irish/German skin like mine! I can't speak for anyone else's skin types.
Works great on sensitive skin and I like the way it makes my skin glow!
This sun teams goes in so smooth and doesn’t break me out
THE WORST PRODUCT EVER!!! I used it for 3 days only applied once a day and my face got a sunburn and also have a bunch of breakouts on my skin which normally doesn't happen! Also im surprised how i got a sunburn if i dont even work outside! My face feels so rough and dry! DO NOT BUY THIS

Wanted something that would give me protection without clogging my pores. One of the products recommended by my dermatologist.  Good price too!
I bought about 20 of these for each of the faculty, staff, and priests at my school as a last day of school gift at the end of the last scholastic school year. They loved it. I love it. It fits in my purse well and I use it on sunny days to protect my face and hands. My dermatologist actually told me I'm supposed to wear sunscreen daily even on cloudy days. She has immaculate, flawless skin and she should know, but I don't bother putting it on daily.
It’s a great product. I love the spf number. Although it’s been a while since I bought it and I’ve noticed the price had increased
ok just want to say I love this product it's lightweight and smells good.
I liked the sun protection, although it takes time to spread, it was good and the face turned a little white but it was okay.It is so good like moisturizer.
When I put on my sunscreen I usually put two fingers worth, but I was questioning if it was too much. It eventually rubbed it but left me with quite a bit of whitewash afterwards..and during the day I noticed that I began flaking? I’m not sure if it was because I used too much but I feel like there could be better options. Try it for yourself, this was my experience..
I’ve been looking for a face sunscreen for awhile now and finally found the one! I work outside for hours and this helps my face not getting sun burnt. I apply it twice a day once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Works great! Will definitely buy again.
It says clear face, no break-out, but it has given me the most break outs since I’ve used this
This is the only sunscreen I will use for my face!
Great product for a great price! Light and fresh.
Can leave white residue on all your clothes after wearing and can have a weird feel to skin but very lightweight. Don’t know if it’s helping with breaking out from sunscreens or not
This product is awesome, easy to apply and doesn’t cause me to breakout!
I recommend. Very good product
I apply sunscreen 3 times a day working an outdoor summer camp. I was starting to break out from the Kroger brand, and with OCD/dermatilomania, its hard for me to leave the acne and scars alone. The less break outs the better. I haven't had any new break outs since using this, now I just have to get rid of the other scars lol

Love this stuff. Only one that I will use on my face. Not oily and long lasting. I have rosacea and it keeps my red cheeks calm.  I recently gave some to my son that works out of doors and never used sunscreen because of acne. He loves it too.
This is a wonderful product. I have used it for a while now and have had ZERO issues with acne and sunburns. My face is moisturized and protected.
The box was damaged. I wanted to give it to someone as a gift, but now I cant do that
This sunscreen has very minimal white cast, but I would recommend not buying if you have very sensitive skin (burn near eyes, even with little/no sweat). I have sensitive skin & have found that even combining with a very gentle moisturizer helps very little anyway. It isn’t heavy though, and the white casts faded after like 2 minutes. Other than the burning sensation, this sunscreen is great.
I spent years finding a sunscreen that wouldn't make me feel gross or look shiny. This is perfect! I swap between spf 50 and 55 depending on which is cheaper at the time I purchase. Definitely recommend!

Good product
I live this sunscreen. It is the only one that don’t give me acne.
Good value & easy to spread. Not greasy.
This is a great sunscreen! It's very lightweight and gives my face a nice gloss without looking too oily. The only things I don't like are that it sometimes leaves white residue (when applied over a moisturizer. It may just be because this sunscreen and my moisturizer don't mix too well), and gives my face a gray-ish tint (I'm naturally tan, with a yellow undertone). I'll be trying other sunscreens in the future, but for now I wouldn't mind going through my whole bottle!
Not for my skintype. Gave me a bad allergic reaction and ashy look.
Not greasy at all. Great protection & didn’t cause breakouts like most sunscreens do.
You spread it on your face, for an example, and it immediately absorbs into the skin.  Out in the sun, it doesn't mix with sweat and get into your eyes, attract dirt and sand to your skin, etc.  It's a real winner.
best I've ever used
Great for the beach, needed high protection for my face but oil free, highly recommend
I love the way spread in my face, non greasy and smell so good!! 👌👌
I think using this for years And Inever break out. It goes on smoothly and gets absorbed quickly.
Used on my face
Non greasy, won’t block pores, very good product
Excelente producto
I've used many sunscreens and so far this is my favorite.This sunscreen doesn't leave any white residue and it's not oily.It spreads very easily and gets absorbed on my skin pretty quickly.After few hours of applying the sunscreen, I found tiny white residues on my sunglasses' nose part and my eyebrows. It's not a big deal to me since I use sunscreen for outdoor activities only.I strongly recommend it!
Product came without any box/ seal on the tube itself. Not sure if it’s all like this
Feels sticky and slightly greasy but other that it’s ok.
Translated from German by Amazon
I have oily/acne prone skin and this sunscreen has worked well. Easy to apply, doesn’t leave my face greasy and doesn’t cause breakouts.
Love this product as my skin is quite oily and other sun blocks cause breakage. This one keeps my skin oil free and no spots. Sun protection also incredible. This is the second time I purchase this product. It lasts a few months and I put it on everyday. It’s a must have for me.
I've loved this product and have used it nearly every day since last January. It's lasted a long time, doesn't cause any skin irritation and blends well into my skin/doesn't leave a cast. The only unfortunate thing, is the price. Paying nearly £20 for a bottle of suncream seems excessive, even if it is good stuff.
I got mixed and akne prone skin.I got this product specifically for the no akne part...i got pimples not a lot but more than beforewith others.Also the smell was really bad and the cream was heavy and oily.I looked like I bathed my face in oil or like my brother said he could see himself on my forehead.
I have the worst face skin. It's oily, red, full of filaments and small pimples. As soon as the sun hits my face, I turn into a crab, a painful one. I'm also a guy, if that's relevant.This cream has been better for me than any other cream in my 20+ years of life so far. It doesn't clog any pores, it's easy too remove if your want to, with water and a bit of soap, its doesn't smell, and it has NO ALCOHOL so it doesn't dry your skin.I live in Europe and this is the second batch I buy of it.And no, even though you shouldn't use sun screen that's older than some months... I can guarantee that after more than one year it still is very effective at blocking the sun. My face can feel a huge difference at the end of the day compared to not using any cream. I'm pretty sure it also has some kind of moisturizing effect, because for a few hours after I apply it, if I stay kiiinda protected from the sun, my face feels much lighter and radiant.
Wanted a facial sunscreen for a summer holiday that would help with my problem skin. I have spot prone skin, and the standard beach break combination of sun lotion and sweat makes me break out terribly so that every time i come back from holiday i look worse than when I went! Ordered this and was surprised at how quickly it came given that it was shipped from the US. Was pretty pleased with this. Had a small breakout but nowhere near what I usually get from when I have tried both a standard suncream and also spent a lot of money on a suncream from a very reputable skincare/makeup company. This may have also been because i sometimes mixed it with my body sun lotion, so it was definitely the best option I've tried so far. Once applied it stayed matte on my generally oily face which i was impressed at. No thick, oily residue that lasts for ages and makes skin shiny. For this reason I actually was able to test this out under makeup before my holiday without a problem at all as it is more matte than many daily moisturizers I've had. Rubbed in well. Occasionally after repeated application it had a quite a tingly feeling but i would liken this to the feeling you get applying a spot cream. My only concern is that as a US product there is no indication of UVA and UVB ratings that UK products give you, hence why I mixed it occasionally with my body suncream. Even so, I would definitely recommend this and will buy again, particularly as it sits so well under makeup that i will happily use it all year round.
Packaging: came nicely packaged and not faulty in any way. The tube has a matte feel which is convenient when having sunscreen covered fingers as it prevents it from slipping out of your hands.Ingredients: compared to other sunscreens, I found no major harmful ingredients in this product and a handful of benefits aside to the obvious uv protection. You can use an online cosmetic analyser to see more info on thisHowever, this sunscreen does leave a white cast behind. To counter this, I can kind of blend it in if I don’t use too much - but then again, I’m white so if you are someone with dark, black or brown skin you may want to avoid this and look towards a sunscreen in a gel form or liquid spray
I’ve probably tried about 20+ different sunscreens in the past two years. Chemical, physical, combo, high-end, drugstore, asian, european, american - you name it, Ive probably tried it. Every single one broke me out somehow. I’ve tried to figure out what ingredient breaks me out but with no success. I bought this with a pinch of salt, I found it strange they can almost guarantee it won’t break you out. I’ve tried the ultra sheer dry touch which didn’t break me out but stung so badly around my eyes. This one doesn’t contain as much fragrance and doesn’t sting at all. This one doesn’t break me out at all. I’m not sure how they do it but it just feels like moisturiser. It will be a sad day when they stop producing this as it’s the only sunscreen I’ll use from now on. It’s slightly shiny but I just apply a matte powder on top and I’m ready to go about my day. Absolutely exceptional Nuetrogena. It also has HELIOPLEX technology meaning it won’t degrade in the sun like other chemical sunscreens would needing to be reapplied every two hours.
I used to like it until warmer weather arrived. The warmer days meant the product moved around the face, getting into eyes, which did not happen during colder months when it stayed put. It stung my eyes so bad especially at the end of the day, as if I was cutting onions, literally watering eyes. And the stinging stayed long after washing vigorously with makeup remover!Also having done a bit of research into chemical sunscreen, I discovered that it was contributing to my dermatitis! Now using 100 percent mineral based sunscreen ONLY!
Seems to work well in protecting against sun damage and preventing skin outbreaks. Does feel light and thin but very oily at the same time and leaves a noticeable white cast that requires a lot of work to rub in. Not sure if it would be suitable for darker skin tones since I am paler, but the white cast could be an issue if you're not pale.
I bought this for a specific reason: I needed a suncream that would go in hand luggage, and it must not cause heat rash. Up until now the only one I could find that didn't bring me out it horrendous rash was Clinique spray (too big for hand luggage, and rather pricey). I'm happy to report that it's so far so good with this.If you have to use oil free suncream, you'll be used to having to reapply regularly (particularly around where clothing or bag straps might rub away from skin), and it's no different with this, but when I applied properly, I didn't burn and most importantly, no heat rash. This is such a big deal for me I'm giving this 5 stars for this fact alone. If you're lucky enough to be able to use oil based suncreams then I expect you will find this substandard because of how easily it rubs off, but if you get heat rash from oil based creams, then I highly recommend trying this.
I've really struggled to find a face sunscreen that didn't clog my pores or make my face go really oily, and so far this has not disappointed! It's really lightweight, soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft but not oily or greasy. The only thing I'm struggling with is the amount to put on - it spreads really easily and when I've put too much on I've noticed that I get it forming into little white strands that I can just brush off but if I dont they stick to my skin.
I haven't tried this product with make up over the top, when I used alone over my normal skin care it was ok and not greasy at all - not to be too fussy but it could be a little chalky if you were to put more products on top
I will get straight to the point.Item arrived dirty, I mean actually dirty, half of the tube (see photo) was covered in something that looked and felt like mud. This was not a transportation issue as the delivery box was clear inside. On top of this, the product was open and it was unclear whether someone had used it, or did who knows what to it. For a skin care product, this doesn't inspire the minimum level of confidence or trust. How is one supposed to put this on their face after this? especially considering the nature of the product.Very disappointed, come on guys!!
I have VERY sensitive skin and would never normally dream of using normal sun lotion on my face. However after reading the reviews I thought I could trust this not to cause me to break out in a reaction.Well, that was justified, as I've had no adverse reactions at all. And it's a cooling, easy-to-use lotion that sinks right in, leaves no reside and is fine underneath make-up or other mousterisers.However, despite applying it every 2 hours as stated, whilst it's stopped me from burning, it hasn't stopped the melasma that I get at this time of year, the blotchy brown skin that is worsened by sun exposure.So, it's fine for normal use, but as a complete sun block, I don't think it works.
It doesn’t leave any whitecast but I thought it would be great for my oily skin as it’s oil free but it does make my face greasy.
It isn't available from the UK only USA.  I purchased this product and the delivery timescale was only 2 weeks, although it advertises it could be longer.  There were no customs charges either (for receipt of international goods).  Its a white fluid but blends in clear and smooth with no caking.  Brillant sunscreen and I would definitely buy this again.  I have acne prone skin so I use it on my face, neck and chest.I do prefer aromatherapy or organic products but the facial sunscreens for acne prone skin are fairly relatively expensive (£40+) for 50ml.Previously I used La Roche Posay Anthelio AC anti-shine matte fluild 50ml facial sunscreen (£16) but I found it very time consuming applying it. You had to be careful how much you apply.  I found it made my face whiter once applied and it caked around drier or hairier areas on my face, such as upper lip, eye brows and hairline.  So I wouldn't recommend this product and I wouldn't use it again myself.
This is a great sunscreen if you don't have sensitive skin. It blends really well into the skin and sits lovely under make-up. However, I had to wash this off after only a short time because it stung like crazy! I assumed that being Neutrogena it woud be good for all skin types, but sadly not.  I guess  it is because it is a chemical suncreen, rather than mineral based. Hence why it blends so easily, but reacts with sensitive skin.
I thought I had found the perfect facial sunscreen. It's non greasy, doesn't bring me out in spots, looks and feels matt, sits well under makeup and doesn't cost the earth. However, to my great dissapointment I have found it makes my eyes water and sting so badly and persistently! I don't put it on my eye lids but around the eye and forehead but somehow, maybe sweat?, It always migrates to my eyes and its very uncomfortable! So dissapointed because I thought this was the one.
Was sceptical at first because I have oily combination skin in and easily break out. I bought this based on online information not personal recommendation so wasn't holding my breath on on its ability to be compatible with my skin. I have been using this for a week, no breakouts,don't use primer anymore because this mattifies my skin for over 8 hours, absolutely brilliant product can't recommend it enough for Asian oily combination skin prone to breakouts and temperamental. Will definitely be buying this product again it is so worth the price.
Cause reaction on skin, hot and slightly stinging. Might be a problem for sensitive skin. But it is true that it is not greasy at all.
Horrible to my skin. I have combi skin and a bit sensitive. I used it for a while, everything was fine but one day I felt like my skin burns. Don’t recommend.
Excellent product very soft,  clear you'll not see goast face , just a smooth clear face ,,,I hate that it is more expensive than a grait French product as La Roche Posay or Vichi,, the price is the only reason I may not buy it again .
10/10 would buy again. The formula is not greasy at all, it absorbs into the skin quickly, there is no white cast, it does not smell of anything and it does not dry out the skin. I have oily skin so this product is perfect, plus you don't need much; a little goes a long way!
Wearing under makeup it’s not bad. Has an unpleasant smell on first application.Makeup sits ok until about 4pm when the shine starts to show through. Happy enough for the price but was hoping for more!
But expensive innit
It's nice but I ve too sensitive skin..... I use it every day it gives a glow but I feel like burning slightly... It's ok though I don't mind
It absorbs really nicely and seems to work pretty well at the beginning especially since I have acne prone skin and break out very easily until after a while I’ve noticed that touching the skin seems to make the suncream rub off in small pieces on certain areas of my face which can be really irritating as you can see small white bits on your face and have to try and dust it off without causing more cream to rub off.
As soon as i put this on my face, it started stinging! I tried it a few times with no luck so ended up chucking it which is a massive waste of money, especially considering i have used much cheaper options before and they did not irritate me. For reference i have sensitive dry skin
Does not have seal or box, just came in the bag and looks like someone already used it, I only had it delivered today. Very disappointing
Bought for my daughter who is fussy about sunscreens on her face. She says it's the best she's ever used and doesn't feel greasy like most.
the product is ok for me. im east asian therefore my skin isnt white---its more like light tan. the smell is just right,not too strong - smells good actually. its not sticky and doesnt leave white marks when u spread or use it properly HOWEVER the only thing i didnt like about it was it made my skin dry especially to my nose area.. so i strongly recommend you to use moisturiser first then apply this after. so far this is the best face sunscreen ive used.
Great product and it didn’t break me out which is great. It does what it claims to do. However it ended up adding up to £19 including the postage which I think is a little steep for the amount of product you get and it being drugstore. But apart from that its a good product
This product is exactly what I wanted high spf and lightweight, although I am very pale so would probably leave a white case on anyone more tan than me. Also sometimes it is a bit too harsh for my skin and makes it sting
after heavy research and reading reviews. I bought this product for my face for protection but want something that wouldn’t clog my pores and cause me to break out (acne skin that is under control and want to keep ornaments that way). This I can confirm does exactly what it says. Won’t break you out and great protection from the sun. Very happy with it. It is a little thinner in terms of texture to normal sunscreens but you get used to it. Just rub it in and you don’t get any white on your face. Fab product.
I have dark skin and most sunscreens leave a white caste on my face however this sunscreen does not.It moisturises and doesn’t sit on the skin however it stings alittle when applied but this goes away in afew minutes.One application lasts me the whole day and my skin looks fresh and nice at the end of the day when I wash it off.
I have oily skin and this is fantastic at keeping my skin matte. It lasts all day and I haven't had any breakouts. So glad I found this!
Cant belive i thought this one would be good. Its a gd consistency dont get me wrong and gave my skin no irritation or rash. But it started pilling and i felt my face then looked in the mirror. Absolutely awful. Thankgod i wasnt going out or my makeup might look like the rocky horror show. Will never buy rhis one again what a waste of my money
I have rosacea and this didn't make me break out. It is a fairly light product and I pat it onto my skin to let it sinks in, doesn't really need rubbing in like some thicker sunscreens. I'm very prone to sunburn naturally, and I'm on medication that makes me even more sensitive to sunburn than normal, and I have not been burnt with this on.
This product is amazing. Because i am black (light-medium skin tone), i was worried it would leave a white mask on my face like the other sunscreens do but this one doesn't. It blends right in and doesn't make my face look oily. This product is good if you have sensitive and oily skin. It really doesn't clog pores too and its not heavy so your skin can really breathe. It's also a great sunscreen, i used it when i went on holiday to Africa and i didn't burn or change skin tones. I am so happy i found this product. Its worth it for the price too cause i've been using it everyday for the past month and it hasn't run out.
I have tried various sunscreen products over the years that I can wear under my make-up.  This product is fantastic.  It goes on and sinks into the skin without leaving and shiny residue.  Mineral or cream foundations go on as usual.  I used this product last year and sat on the beach (in England) when it was around 82f.  I did not burn at all when usually my face goes bright red.  I will be looking at other Neutrogena products to buy as I have been so impressed with this.
I first bought it on holiday in Las Vegas as I ran out and it was great. I went to the Canary Islands and used it all over. Apart from a really mild patch of prickly heat (after a week of using it) it was great!
This is the best spf I've ever usedDoesn't clog pores
I would give 5 stars - non greasy, light, pleasant to skin, etc. but when i apply it i get a tingling burning sensation around the eye area for a bit, it goes away but is quite strong and unpleasant. the directions dont say avoid eye area, it's specifically for face, so i would expect it would be suitable for eye area too. on the other hand, many effective creams tingle when applied but this tingling is quite strong! maybe i'm doing something wrong... i dont really have a sensitive skin....
I really like this brand and this is a great product for your skin. I have dry skin and it feels really nice
Received this product properly sealed. Thankful for this, I hope this really won’t make my skin breakout. Been using it for few days now and I have noticed that I am not having breakouts.
I was looking for a face moisturiser with good spf but I struggled finding something that did the job well. Now I mix in a pea size amount of both my moisturiser and this cream and it does the job well. My skin is smooth and grease free all day.
Delicate on my sensitive skin
Been using this for a few months and put on everyday as I have some hyperpigmentation. Really good, and although a bit thick consistency, it has not caused any breakouts. Overall, will carry on using it, and have even got my teenage daughter onto it.
I have used this product for the last two years and it is excellent.  I cannot recommend it highly enough for offering protection to your skin and stopping break outs that occur so regularly with other face sun lotions- give it a try you will not be disappointed!
This product was recommended by Dr V on You Tube hence bought it. Really pleased with it.
It's so important to protect your skin against any sun damage and this is perfect! Super light, non greasy, absorbs really well and no breakouts what more could you ask for?!
10/10 doesn't make me get spots and is so light weight!!
I love this  product! I am an Indian lady and this is the only stuff that does not stay white on my skin. It vanishes completely but protects my hyperpigmentation from getting any worse. I know it works because my husband is white and has been using it when he goes to play golf. He usually comes back burnt and red but not with this stuff. Happy days all round.
I really struggle with acne flare ups from SPF products but have had no problems with this after using it everyday for weeks!
I’ve tried various creams over the years and always had problems with breakouts, until trying this one about 4 years ago, now I always use this and basically dread the day it’s discontinued or something!  Definitely recommend this cream.
Didn't have much use for it last Summer but it seems as thought it will be OK. Would have preferred one with a slight tint to it as it looks rather white on my face.

Fantastic high factor cream that I wear under my makeup everyday! Very light and non greasy doesn’t cause spots or oily skin, has no smell to it and lasts ages. Perfect
I dont understand what this sunscreen contains, but this made my face feel very strange. I had a numbing feeling after putting it on. That scared me so much I decided to not use it anymore. Be aware if you have sensitive skin, as this might not be good for you. Honestly, I dont have that sensitive skin and I still reacted to it somehow. Another thing is Neutrogena was just criticized for claiming that they offer high protection. Most of these dont offer that high protection, so for instance here it says 55 but you only get 30-35 in reality. Dont be fooled.
In love with this product 😍
Really good option if you are looking for a good SPF it's cheap , It is not soo lightweight but it is just perfect enough for my even prone acne skin ! i recommend this to anyone !
GOT ACNE? use this! I use this spring through autumn. Love it. Not sticky and smells fresh. Wish it didn't have a scent but it doesnt irritate or block your pores. Highly recommended to me by my Derm. Only problem, it makes the skin look a little dewy at the end of the day, which I love, but if you hate having oily looking skin, I would look elsewhere.
Not sure whether it works with acne prone skin as I still have milia type spots after three months of use. I have continued to use it as I use Differin gel every night. After cleaning, toning and moisturising I wait 5 minutes and then use sunscreen. Initially it does burn for a few minutes causing some redness but then stops. Don't think I will re-purchase as my skin feels greasy afterwards.
Very lovely product, i suffer from acne breakouts since the age of 14 and am now 22, this product doesnt seem to clog my pores, lovely product. Also it doesnt leave a white look on my face and im a fairly light skinned Asian.
I've had loads of disagreements with face SPFs and tried so many others, but this one is definitely my favourite! It blends into the skin nice and quick so your face doesn't look oily or greasy. So nice to apply as well, it's such a lovely product and hasn't irritated my sensitive skin. Used it every single day and near the end of my bottle so looking to repurchase!
Its amazing, makes your skin feel velvety. No oiliness whatsoever
The best sunscreen for oily skin ever after I have tried 20 or more different branches for oily skin. It leaves no white mark whatsoever. It absorbs quickly to the skin as if there was no sunscreen applied.I have recommended it to all my friends and acquaintances when we talk about skincare and make-up.
This ended up causing a horrible rash that looked like burns on my skin. It contains cinnamon bark which can be an allergen. Not easy to blend into face and can pill.
Light and easy to apply. Makes my face super shiny so some powder or foundation is a must!
Very good
don't get this because it leaves a white cast and is note nice on the skin at all. I recommend you invest in the biore sunscreen
I had a similar product from Neutrogena a few years ago which I felt worked much better. I found this went on quite thick but left my skin matt which was good, however didn't prevent any breakouts unfortunately maybe it was just bad timing on my skin would probably try a different product next time
I love the this lightweight sun cream. Came quickly
This is the third time I've bought this product.  Husband had skin cancer and has to use protection all year round.  He also suffers with severe acne, to the point where he has such greasy skin he gets abscesses under the skin.  Uses this with faith.  Not at all greasy.  No smells. And disappears straight into the skin.  Never causing breakouts.  Fantastic
Love this productI always suffer with spots when on holiday from the suncream I use on my faceThis product is well worth the moneyNot one spotEasy to apply sank in well and skin felt smoothNo residueNeed to reapply after being in water
I always purchase this product before going on holidays as I feel it works best. I have acne prone skin and I find normal sun creams oily and cause my skin to breakout. I wear this everyday on holidays and it works great. It leaves a nice matte finish so I often wear it alongside my make-up. Great product.
Yes, they are right!!! If you see that people say this product is really matt, that's true! I am south-east Asian and my skin is easy to get darker, using other product just make my skin oily and prone to acne. No doubt with Neutrogena products, it is the best on the market. Easy to apply. So happy to find this one! Very recommended!!!
I'm really pleased with this product. I really struggle to find sunscreens and moisturisers that don't make my skin really oily, but I've been using this for about a week and my skin has been far more matte than usual. This may mean it's not ideal for people with dry skin, but I would thoroughly recommend it for anyone with combination/oily skin.
This is the only sun cream that agrees with my skin. I've tried different products, all specifically for the face, mostly those available in Boots, and all left me with greasy skin and therefore spots...after just one application.So I went without mostly, which is a bad idea.Until, my face tanned by several shades, but not the rest of my body.
Light sunscreen, does blend well, however, sometimes it does oxidise
Love Neutrogena products and again this one didn't disappoint! It is never very easy to get some of there products and a lot seem to get discontinued but I hope they keep supplying this. Doesn't break me out ever though I have very oily skin and doesn't feel heavy. Great for extra protection in summer and I use the 30 rest of the year.
I started using this product recently. Honestly, I am disappointed in this product.On the first use everything was fine, but over the course of a few days I began to feel a stinging sensation when applied. The stinging developed into a burning sensation and eventually I had to stop using the product all together. After I stopped using the product; the redness on my face went down and my acne reduced. Furthermore, I found that I had small chemical burns (confirmed by my GP) dotted around my face that weren't present before using this product. I was sceptical if this was even the true account for Neutrogena and I believe- now- that it isn't, I also believe that the product was counterfeit.I implore you do not buy this product.
Really Good for face protection against the sun - It is a little strong, so maybe find a lower factor one from neutrogena.BUT... Finally I have found a sun-lotion that doesn't case my acne to break out.Cost is high, but spot-prone skin individuals like myself will happily pay to have a product that helps.
Fantastic! At last I have found a face sun lotion that doesn't make you look oily and greasy. It is so light that you can wear it all day and every day, not just when sunbathing. I first came across it in USA and am so pleased I can get it in UK on line,
This has really worked well on my skin luckily, I normally have issues when it comes to face creams, but this one is perfect for me! I use a little bit every morning and sometimes through out the day, depending on the heat and sun, and if im actually in the sun which isn't always the case. But overall great product.
Great for oily skin, the only drawback is unpleasant smell of product but once applied the odour disappears.
One of the best facial sunscreen I have used. Very good to normal to oily skin
Great protection from this product
I had high hopes for this, as it is called clear face and announces twice on the front that it will not cause breakouts.  However, it did.  Really bad acne from which I am still recovering two weeks later, after a thin application removed after a few hours when I could get to a tap - I could feel the spots starting!  As far as I am aware it protected me from the sun, but it certainly did NOT do what it said on the tube.
Beautiful and non greasy, the only sun screen product I have found which never creates spots.  I found it first in the USA and was delighted to be able to obtain it in the UK.
White cast.
although it states that it is oil free, my face became greasy within an hour of application, I hope it didn't affect it's effectiveness.
It's the only SPF I can use in my face without braking out! At first in might sting a little, but that will pass. I use this every day. You get perfect protection with a layer of rosehip oil first then this on top. Got a milky and non greasy consistently and perfect under makeup!
Not actually a liquid , creamy in texture but rubbed in ok and did not look white .
Am having to revise my previous review. Absolutely loved this sunscreen, previously was using spf 55, but when ran out bought this one to last through spring. Took me a while to realise that what was happening with my skin was caused by this sunscreen. My usually greasy combo skin became inflamed, red, and began flaking off in very embarrassing noticeable large scaly patches.it literally looked and felt like I had been burnt! Be warned this may be a fake product! Also, no seal on the tube, which I should have taken need of in the first place. God knows what I had been using on my face i dread to think.
I really like this product, not too thick. Its really good for those who suffer from acne or sensitive skin, only sunscreen I have tried that doesn't leave breakouts.
I use the product as directed and without fail the product pills and leaves white residue all over my face. It looks like someone's had at me with a dry exfoliating brush, to be honest. I can't say anything for the UVA/B protection, but if it can't properly absorb into your face I don't see how this product could be any effective in that regard.
Took this on holiday in 36 degrees C plus heat and it worked brilliantly. It wasn’t greasy and you can put bronzer etc on over the top of it. It lasted all day for me.
I hate sunscreen its greasy and sticky and makes the sun a misery for me. However my skin is near enough blue and I really do need sunscreen. This is the first sunscreen I have found that doesn't make me look like I have been basted! Seems effective and most of all I can put it on and not be irritated by it.
I bought this sunscreen cause it says breakout-free. It is a nightmare for me! Since I use this sunscreen I have painful red pimples all over my face. I don't recommend it at all. It is a waste of money and it ruined my skin.
FINALLY I've found a sunscreen that doesn't leave a white/grey cast.  I am a black woman and it has been a nightmare trying to find a decent sunscreen. Well ladies (and gents) THIS IS IT!!!  Stings the eyes so be careful when applying near the eyes. Perfect sunscreen.
None blocking pores product. Easy to apply and doesn't leave any whitecast or grease.The smell is quite strong during the day but it is not unpleasant. I like it.
Love this product!  I first discovered the factor 50 and to be honest, it took a while to rub in.  This one is much thinner and absorbs much quicker.  Love the matt finish, I use this as an everyday moisturiser and it sits well under make up
Translated from German by Amazon
but I do find that it's not very gentle, may cause problems for very sensitive skin.
Great sunscreen and easy to apply
Very good !! I have bad acne breakouts with suncream as they're too greasy usually. However after lots of research on face suncream I found this one. Leaves my face matte and grease free and doesn't cause any redness either. Very impressed and glad I bought this.
Not for me unfortunately. Strong unpleasant smell,sticky residue, can cause breakouts. Three stars for the effort and the fact that Neutrogena is an overall reliable company.
My skin is very prone to breakouts. Having tried this sunscreen for couple of months now, it didn't give me any breakouts. It doesn't leave my skin greasy at all. It perfectly does the job for me and will definitely buy it again.
It doesn't break me out. So that is great. :) Maybe everyone's skin is different. So give it a try and if it breaks you out just stop using it.
it works!!! I thought it was impossible because my skin is prone to acne but this is the first sun cream that doesn't cause my skin to break out.
So far so good, doesn't leave my skin greasy and I haven't got sunburn. It's a lot more watery then I expected after using normal sunscreen but I'll be buying this for my acne ridden 14 year old.
Very light and great to apply. Didn’t burn during a three-week holiday in the sun. Definitely recommend this.
I have acne prone oily combination skin and I suffer from cystic acne. This sunscreen is brilliant ... No breakouts or oilyness. And certain no white cast. Will and have always kept buying!
Excellent product and service
Neutrogena products neve disappoint and this seller delivered super fast. The cream is very light and quite runny. Unlike every other sunblock I have tried it doesn't feel greasy on my skin. Time will tell if sunblock related break-outs are a thing of the past but I am hopeful.
Product stings eyes and acne. Completely horrible to use. Doesn’t leave a matte finish. And balls up on skin. Truthfully had better sunscreen from Aldi at half the price. Don’t waste your money
Expensive but worth it if you want a really good sun cream for a spot prone skin
It didn't clog my pores. it is not super matt though.Will surely purchase again..
I have used this product for years, it’s an excellent non greasy sun protector.
Not overly impressed - caused my eyes to sting.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Great for Acne skin, the best
didn't work for me its not the worst ive had but I did have a breakout with it
Always had skin problems when using moisturisers however this one is very light prevents breakouts and is an excellent spf.
Excellent product if you suffer break outs using sun lotions. It's dries quickly and I can put on make up within minutes of applying the product.
Was ok, not as good as i thought and still white residue left but better than burning
Exactly as stated
Fast delivery good quality great communication  good packaging very happy customer thank you
This product stung my face when applied. I asked my husband to try it also I case it was just me but he had the same stinging feeling. Very uncomfortable and had to wash it off immediately as it felt like it was burning.  I have only just returned from holiday therefore have missed the return date for this product but I would still like to return it for a Refund. Can you please advise.
Bought as a new product but it arrived unsealed and had leaked - I won't use it as can't guarantee quality and there is no option to return the product.
seems good,
I like the way it is sooo light
Burning sensation when applied, but works fine. Matte finish
feels good on face and non greasy. will buy more
Great product!! Doesn’t leave your skin oily and doesn’t cause break outs.
I have really bad acne, and I have break outs with most products. Nothing with this, really impressed! This is my second purchase of this.
does the job
cool stuff
Excellent  Matt coverage and ideally for oily skin.
Good product. Not greasy!
Turns white on your face if you sweat even just a little bit. A pointless product really, aside for use anywhere apart from the face.
Worked great for me, indeed I have oily skin so i didn't hv any problems with this at all
Really good for your face if you're prone to reacting to sunscreen - non greasy and effective.
I’ve realised this product actually makes me burn! Concerned it’s fake. And it still causes spots.
Good high coverage but greasy
I really really wanted to like this but I jmy experience with it was not good at all. I have oily skin so I break out fairly easily but I really never had this kind of results before. My skin got all red and bloated as if I had an allergic reaction to it. Not sure if it was a defaultive batch but not willing to give it another try to find out.
Original product and a very nice sunscreen
This product is misleadingly marketed. When I put it on my skin (which is usually largely fine), my skin broke out really badly. I got the worse spots I've had in years.  I stopped using it and it cleared up.
Doesn't break me out and leaves me with a beautiful finish!
Good product.  Not oily or heavy at all.  Does not cause skin breakouts.
This is the best sun lotion ever. It doesn't leave any white residue at all. I think found my best sunscreen
Lovely sun lotion for face, didn't feel greasy and dried quickly. Will always use this brand from now on
leaves a white tint, you have to rub in it to try cover the tint which makes it undesirable for spf especially if your going to be regularly applying it
Works great on my sensitive skin. Light and easily absorbed.
A good product
Easy to apply and doesn't leave me looking like a pale face. So fr has been excellent at avoiding sun burnt faces
Great product. Does not feel oily or greasy or make your skin break out!
Good product.
This product is amazing. The best I have found during my whole 65 years!! Will never be without it now.
works well good protection for my husbands sensitive skin
Excellent for black skin as it absorbes into skin without leaving white residue
So far so good
Great for those with allergies to other sunscreen lotions or creams.
Balls/flakes when applied on top of anything else.Stings my skin.Doesn't absorb in properly.Not a nice smell.
Amazing. Best sun cream I've ever found for my face. For once the packaging doesn't lie. No breakouts!
Have just started using it and so far very pleased, non greasy, absorbs into the skin quickly
Bought this for my holiday to Thailand. All face sun creams make me come out in spots. I had high hopes for this cream due to the reviews. Sadly it was just the same as all other lotions apart from it wasn't greasy on my face. Didn't work for me sadly but i do have a real problem with my pores blocking.
Wouldnt recommended. Never reacted to a lotion before but this one made my whole face come up in a bright red rash ironically feels like sun burn. Its day 2 and its still not gone.
Has a white/blueish cast on darker tones.
Great stuff!
great product didn't come out in spots lolthank you
Excellent. Not sticky.good spf and should be fine under makeup
Mmmmm - this clear face liquid actually gave me spots! I am very prone to break outs with new products but as this is specifically designed not to block pores I thought this wouldn't happen - sadly  was wrong.  I persevered for 3 weeks then gave up - 5 weeks later my skin has finally settled down!
Great value especially for sensitive skin.
Caused a reaction.
Really good does exactly what it says!
Best sunscreen for fair skin types
great
Made me break out almost immediately so won't be repurchasing!
Too thick and still felt greasy
very impressed with this face sunscreen,better than any high quality brands i have bought before.
Translated from Spanish by Amazon
Made my skin sting and get loads of tiny spots - way worse than regular cheap stuff that I put on my body!
full strange ingredients and very sticky on the skin
This is great for my skin as it doesn't give me spots like other facial sunscreens. Would definitely buy it again.
Great
It gives you a blue tint on your face after application, its very thick, I don't recommend.
Brilliant product! No spots, clearer skin than usual and no sunburn, yay!
This is excellent if you need an oil free lotion due to skin problems.
love love love it!!!
irritated my face, when it drys it creates flakes.
Good product.Easy to apply but can't find it here in France. And for the order very fast shipping. Many thanks
Great, non-greasy face sun cream
came on time good product
Super fast delivery! Very happy with purchase
Really great. I love it!
Did not cause break outs
Worked well, thanks
Not greasy good for face
Good
Great
great

I would gladly have a white film of sunblock on my face than skin cancer.  I was recently diagnosed w/precanerous sun spots on my face and have had to go through getting the spots frozen and also using an ointment that has similar effects.  The results of this have left my face temporarily red, scabbed and wishing I had paid attention to the warnings of sun damage.  If I only knew then what I know now.....WEAR SUNBLOCK, all day, every day.   Who cares if it leaves a white film on your skin, that means it's working. I recently got a compliment from someone saying they liked my highlights on my face....I told them it was sunblock.  Wear it and stop complaining about the white, thickness.  I wish I would have.
Excellent product! Easy to apply & easy to rub in (I need to rub it in so I don’t have white  stripes). I like this much better than the liquid versions as it does not get in my eyes.
Been using this product for 5 years 365 days a year. Great protection.
I love this chemical-free sunscreen!  It is easy to apply and provides excellent coverage.
Love this product! It's the real deal! It seems sticky coming out of the tube but it applies smoothly and easily! I use this between moisturizer and foundation, allowing for a couple minutes drying time between layers. I strongly recommend this  product!
My skin is sensitive,oily with large pores and fair.This sunscreen protects my skin completly from UVA  radiants(skin-aging) and UVB.I wear it as primer,the BEST primer ever!!!I use a loose powder after sunscreen ,and the result is very smooth and beautifull!!It is amazing!!It isn`t greasy like the others physical sunscreens. Don`t change this formula!!
It is good coverage for a fair complexion but does leave a light film that is white; it can be covered easily with makeup.
Very effective for sunscreen and does not feel greasy. Recommended by my dermatologist.
I am really surprised at how this product performed.  We have always been Coppertone fans, but you won me over with the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc home testing.   Bye, bye Coppertone, Hello Neutrogena :)
i loved how this went on, I love that it is for sensitive eczema prone skin.  I felt safe putting it on my daughters very delicate skin.  I usually have problems with finding a good sunscreen for her
I am very fair skinned and have tried many different sunscreens. Neutrogena is by far the best. Most sunscreens ar so greasy and don't have a pleasant smell. This one isn't greasy at all and is virtually odor free, while providing the protection I need. This will definitely be my new go to sunscreen.
I really like this sunscreen. I like that it was not greasy at all, and it barely had a scent to it.It was very easy to apply, didn't seem to wear off easily like some sunscreens do, and it was very long lasting.It provided great protection from the sun, and comes in a form that I like. It was also very easy to dispense from the tube. I also liked how it has an SPF of 50, and it did not irritate my skin.
Super skin protectant this stuff is fantastic ! I will be buying more
Amazing!!! Dissolved in my skin rather quickly. The smell was soft and fresh while it last all day. There was no oily residue or anything left on my skin.
I really think this is the best sunscreen I've tried Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry Touch SPF50 is fantastic, it is non greasy and really dry touch and works well for hours. The kids and I love the non greasy dry touch texture,  and it's thick, it doesn't run down their bodies when I apply it. It is my new choice for sunscreen and everyone should get some. It is also affordable and you don't have to use as much as traditional sunscreen, so it lasts longer. I have always trusted Neutrogena and this products gets my trust as well.  We love it. Thanks Home Tester Club for the opportunity to try this for free.
I have suffered for years trying every product out there! This lets me actually go out in the sun and enjoy it rather than burning and blistering. I it light and not greasy and I will definitely go buy when my sample runs out!
This is fantastic, I'm in phoenix, Az.  and last week it was over 120° here.  The whole  family used this and we all loved it!  it was non greasy, light weight and did not melt off  (non of that dripping into your eyes!)  It made you skin look and feel wonderful.  And no sun burn!!  This is a must have!
This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. I live in Florida, and run outside. and can depend on this sunscreen to protect my skin. Other sunscreens I have tried have turned white and runny on my skin as I sweat. This lightweight, non-greasy formula keeps my skin dry and doesn't rub off no matter how sweaty I get. I can sometimes be out in the sun for two hours, and this product has kept me protected. I love that it is mineral based. I feel like I am using a quality, natural product from a brand that I can trust.
My daughter needs sun protection and she has sensitive skin and Eczema and I want her to be protected, With the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry Touch SPF 50. and also accepted by the Eczema Association  Not only does she get the protection she needs, but it is hypoallergenic and great for her skin issues. I trust Neutrogena and I feel that they are leading the way when it comes to caring for skin .
I really felt safe wearing the Neutrogena sunscreen with the SPF 50 it was very lightweight and it was soft my skin! I will definitely for sure by this from now on I really respect this brand and product!
THIS SUNSCREEN WAS ABSOLUTLY AMAZING. I loved it so much and it had amazing coverage while being gentle enough for a baby. I know the product may cost more than other sunscreens but the price is definatly worth it!
I really enjoyed using the Sheer Zinc Neutrogena Sunscreen! It has a nice light , fresh scent! It is easy to apply, not greasy or messy! And it seems to last! I have FAIR skin and did not burn!
Went on easily, not greasy. Lasted the entire time that I was out.
I think it was a great products.. did not leave me feeling oily.
Love this sunscreen, it provides good protection from the sun and it's not messy!
Neutrogena Sheer Zinc spf50 is a great addition to your beach arsenal. It goes on lightweight and doesn't feel greasy. It makes sure your skin can breathe. Better than my regular sunscreen and I'm glad I made the switch.
We use this sunscreen when we are out on the water fishing. It has saved us from sunburns and pain. The doctor recommended it for coverage to protect from cancer spots that came up. Since using it there have been no more scares and we wear better clothing to help protect us.
This sunscreen works extremely well. I like how lightweight and effective it is.
Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry Touch SPF 50 feels is a mineral sunscreen that feels great on your skin & is made with Purescreen® naturally-sourced 100% zinc oxide technology!
It was great.  All my children enjoyed it and I liked the feel
Loved this product. Feel good about my family using this.
Non-greasy. I wore it under makeup without any problems. I'm very happy with the ingredients and SPF. If I had any negatives, it would be that my skin is a shade lighter when I use it.   However, because I use it under my make up, it is not as big of a deal.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this sunscreen!
Great sunscreen. It's lightweight on my akin and not greasy. Works well. I felt protected the whole time I was in the sun!
The Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry Touch SPF 50 Sunscreen is great for those that have sensitive skin! It was not greasy after applying it and absorbed really quick into my skin. It left my skin feeling protected and smooth. The best thing I love about it is free of harsh chemicals! I will absolutely give it another try this summer and recommend it to all my family and friends!
It went on nicely. Didn't feel oily or anything. It also lasted for hours without worries.
Neutrogena Sheer Zinc gives great protection while in the sun.  I really like that this product is free of harsh chemicals and I can use on my sensitive skin.
Initially I thought I'd be putting on clown make up. It looked thick and, well, like the stuff lifeguards put on top their noses. But it went on smooth. I always start with my neck and work upward. My only problems were working around scars and my eye brows. That was easily solved after I used a little make up. I live in Florida where it's gorgeous, but very humid. It would be great if they could make this technology for hair VB products too!
I was offered a chance to try Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry-Touch Suncreen for free and I was thrilled.  I live in the desert and use sun protection year round.  This is non greasy (I could even use it under makeup), water/sweat resistant and has a pleasant smell.  Overall it's my new go to for a general daily sunscreen.
This is a very good sunscreen but I am not fond of the way it goes on. It is quite dry once on your face and there is pulling of the skin to get it to spread.  I like neutrogena products but I think I will find one not labeled “dry”. It needs to be easier to spread.
I'm a big fan of the Neutrogena brand, and I am also a daily sunscreen user. I tried the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc dry touch sunscreen and it was much more pleasant to use than other mineral sunscreens that I have tried. I would have liked it to rub in a bit easier, and I wish the scent was a bit more subtle.
Does a very good job of sun protection in and out of the water. It's great for small areas, such as the nose or cheeks that are susceptible to burning. However, because it's a zinc product I found it very difficult to apply a light coat evenly over a large area. I found it much like spreading ointment on a baby's bottom. I wouldn't have a problem pasting this on a child, but as an adult I want the sunscreen to be invisible.
It has a great sunscreen protection, and goes on smooth. I just didn't like that it made my face so white instead of blending in with my natural color.
Tried this because zinc based sunscreen is better for the ocean reef health and gentler on skin. I'm a die hard Neutrogena sheer sunscreen user of the other variety, as I can't stand the feel of sunscreen and the sheer is the best for that. The new sheer zinc is the best of zinc, but still leaves white steaks on your skin and feels much stickier than the nonzinc version. It is however FAR superior to the feel of other zinc products. So if you want zinc, use this. If you don't care about zinc, use the nonzinc Neutrogena sheer product.
This sunscreen does give good protection from the sun. However, I dislike the scent and the fact that it feels very thick and greasy and takes awhile to sink into your skin.
It is very nice, but I would've liked to have the spf higher
While I love the protection that the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry Touch provides I hate the feeling it leaves on my skin. It is hard to describe the feeling but it makes me feel like I have a coat of grime in me and it takes washing myself with exfoliating cleansers three times before I can get the residue off of my skin. Not only does the feeling feel grimy but the zinc opaque white film transfers to EVERYTHING. This sunscreen never dries down it just spreads and spreads. I was sent this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review.
I like that Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry Touch SPF 50 is free of fragrance, chemicals, parabens, etc.   however I did not find it all that easy to apply...it is very thick and was not the easiest to rub in!  After I applied it, I had to go wash my hand because they were covered in it.  I like the benefits of this sunscreen but not the application of it.
It worked excellent for sun protection on a 5 hour boat trip this weekend but my husband said I smelled like flonase...the allergy nose spray and it really dried out my skin.  A little bit goes a long way also.
Very thick and difficult to smooth into face. Pulls the skin. Very white on the face and you can’t blend it enough into the skin. When I sweat it gets even whiter. It’s ok for the body but still leaves a white cast.
sure it works but it irritates my eyes an extreme amount . sunscreen doesn’t usually do this to me. thank you for hurting my eyes and barely spreading across my face bc ur so dry.
has a stinky smell, otherwise its good, doesnt drip into my eyes working outside in heat when I sweat
It works really well, but it has a clay like consistency that makes it really hard to rub into the skin and spread around your body which can sometimes make it easy to miss a spot. It usually leaves a white cast, which I don't really mind but I wouldn't consider it sheer at all. All in all it works well, but the consistency is a turn off for me so I'll use what I have and try other mineral sunscreens.
I did a patch test with this on my arm and it was ok. And then after 2-3 days, I applied it to my face and neck and went out and drove for maybe 15 mins. Next day my face and neck was red, I guess I am allergic to it when it reacts with sunlight. I am also allergic to the Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen SPF 110 and Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen SPF 55. But since this one says it mineral based and all the positive reviews i thought this would work for me. :-( . I have used Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Water Resistant SPF 55 for around 6 years and I am not allergic to it but I started getting more acne so wanted to tryout something else. Not sure what ingredient I am allergic to. Also this sunscreen is not easy to apply.
This sunscreen is a great product it is the best out there for my wifes sensitive pale skin. The problem with this sunscreen is... I now can't get it off my vinyl boat seats. The seats look stained in spots and I can't get the stains out. I have tried a few different types of vinyl cleaners, simple green and dawn dish detergent with no success. I don't want to ruin the seats so I'm afraid to try anything else. Any suggestions to remove this would be appreciated.
I like neutropenia product but I didn’t like this one. After applying it, my skin feels dry and looks really white. It is also hard to spread since it has a thick formula
I bought this for body formulation and another for face formulation to use when I go running. I'm allergic to chemically based sunscreens and need ones that are mineral-based. Please have your R&D come up with something better. 1) These products won't rub into my skin. 2) They rub off on everything you come in contact with. 3) They leave a white cast. 4) They're difficult to wash off from your skin. Neutrogena, please make something better. PLEASE!
I wanted the extra protection of Zinc for my nose, but used it on all of my face, neck abd chest.  It didn’t dry clear for me and left a little pulled up residue that showed when it dried.
This product is on the list of sunscreens contaminated with benzene, a carcinogen.  When it is found to be free of benzene, I would buy it again.
I have used Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch SPF 100+ for several years with excellent results. When I saw one for sensitive skin I assumed that it would be better. I applied it in the morning and washed it off that night with no problem. When I woke up the next morning I had a horrible rash like a severe sunburn. My face was swollen and very hot to the touch. It's been 4 days now and finally back to normal. I did notify the company and gave them my info. I received a coupon for purchase that expires in a month. I would suggest that you test this product on a small area before putting it all over your face like I did.
My skin does not like chemical sun screens so I was looking for a mineral sunscreen. This product is described as “sheer” and “dry touch,” so sounded like a good choice for sun protection at high altitude. Well it is a thick white cream that doesn’t absorb well. It feels goopy and damp on my skin and definitely leaves a white cast. it reminds me of the white zinc that lifeguards used to wear on their noses. I honestly cannot believe that Neutrogena would create this bad a product. It’s going straight in the garbage.
Thick. White cast. Not made for deeper skin tones. Disappointing.
As a devoted user of Neutrogena products I am very disappointed in this one. A product labeled dry touch and sheer should not feel sticky 15 minutes later and turn your skin a sickly blue cast. I am sick of wasting money on products that are misrepresented. I feel like a fool for not having saved my receipt so I could take this back to the store. Don’t buy this product unless u want to look like an alien.
The product is extremely thick and leaves a heavy, white residue on the skin. Most unattractive!
Let me preface this review by saying I use numerous neutrogena products and love them all but this was a total disappointment.  Not sure why it’s labeled sheer because it is white and very difficult to rub.  It goes on thick and sticky.  I’m not sure how all these other reviews say differently.
I am allergic to chemical sunscreen, BP-3.I was excited to try this one with zinc, however, got a rash where I applied it on my hands.  Trying to figure out which ingredient caused this reaction.
I woke up right after an over night skin treatment with glowing soft skin and then made the grave mistake of using this horrid product. It left a hideous white film over my face and BURNED. It completely undid all of the treatment I did the previous night and ON TOP OF THAT was so sticky and greasy, it would not fade after 15 minutes. Basically everything it said on the bottle proved to be false.
It doesn’t fade away when applied to your skin.  I was very displeased with this product and normally I stand by Neutrogena products all the way.  I would not purchase this again.  Ever.
I do not have sensitive skin and I have never had issues with SPF ingredients before but this product is a bad combination for my skin. I bought this product because I was trying to avoid more toxic chemicals found in other SPFs but after using this for days, I think it would be better to go without. I broke out because of the formula. It's very difficult to fully remove from your face, even after a double cleanse. I have fair skin, but it did still leave a white sheen on my face. It's stickier than most mineral SPFs. Overall, I was quite disappointed with the product, and I would not recommend this to anyone.
I have used Neutrogena sunscreen for years without issues. Shopping one day and saw this new formula and it seemed great being that is contained more zinc and less chemicals however after my 1st attempt it will be thrown away! I didn’t even get to wear it to the pool! I coated down, let it dry for about 15-20 minutes then put on my black tankini, HUGE MISTAKE! My black bathing suit had white streaks all over it, it appear like deodorant streaks and would not come off of. Neutrogena, you have to do better, this is ridiculous!
I bought this a few weeks ago and got horribly burned at the pool. I thought it might have been user error so the second time around I was super careful. Nope. Got a horrible sunburn for the second time. I can't believe this is the price it is and didn't even work.
This stuff is awful!! Used it this morning & it doesn't rub well into the skin, ruined a watch band, and really doesn't come off. This stuff is going back....never again.
I have been using Neutrogena Dry-Touch sunscreen for years, so I was sure that the new Sheer Zinc product would be equally pleasant to use.  I was so confident, I bought two tubes before trying it.The Sheer Zinc Dry-Touch left a white film on my skin even hours after being applied. It did not wash off after scrubbing in the shower.  I could still see white residue in the creases on my arms 24 hours after showering.  I shared my second tube with my adult daughter, but she gave it back because it was too hard to get it to rub in./not show.
I have no idea what ingredient/s caused they swollen red itchy eyelids but TOTALLY returning this and not sure i will our hase Neutrogena products again
I bought two tubes. Threw one out and returned the unused tube. Very hard to apply as the lotion is thick. Even worse would not wash off with bar soap. I had to use Dawn dishwashing detergent! The lotion also rubbed off on the interior of my car. I couldn't be more dissatisfied. Went back to Neutrogena 45 shear touch that I love.
I bought this today at my local Hy-vee, thinking this would protect me from the sun. Usually I dont wear sunscreen, and almost never get sunburnt, but I wanted to try out this product.I did exactly as it told me to use it, and only went outside for 50 minutes, didnt sweat, and was mostly in the shade. But even THEN it gave me sunburn! Now I cant even put on any moisturizer because it just BURNS!
I'm getting really sick and tired of Neutrogena adding scents to their face and body products.  It is totally unnecessary and, more importantly, irritating to those of us who are sensitive to smells.  Get with the times Neutrogena.
I do not recommend this product and regret purchasing it! Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Face Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 was used on the first day of our vacation. I applied it to my face and body. In fact, I caked it on my lips and nose. I knew something was wrong within the first couple of hours. My lips burned so badly they blistered and I look disgusting. My arms and shoulders were red and sore and burned! I regret putting in on my children who also burned. It ruined our vacation and I did not go back into the sun for days. Take this horrible product off the shelves.
It feels really heavy, allows some protection but have to constanlty reapply.
This is a superior product designed for people with sensitive skin who also have are fair skinned. It is natural as well. I would highly recommend it!
It felt like leather on my skin and stuck to my skin so well that when I shaved it all got stuck in my razor and I had to throw it away. Although the skin protection was superb, I feel so improvements need to be made to this product.
"hi people welcome back to my youtube
channel this is nanny desai it's
officially christmas season over here
and you are gonna see this
christmas tree for rest of the video and
rest of the holiday season
and if i'm too lazy to take it down
until january so i guess in the videos
of january 2
so i can't help with it and i suck at
decorating trees so yeah
don't judge me for that so in today's
video we are going to review new to
china ultra share
dry touch sunblock with spf 50 plus we
are gonna
point out everything that has been
included in this sunscreen
and how does it actually works and is it
actually dry touch or not
okay so i've been using it for like one
year now it's it's a very nice product
but it has its own
drawbacks okay so first of all the one
thing that i love about this product is
that it's
water resistant and it's sweat resistant
it's the summer season i
am looking for sunscreens which are
sweat resistant and water resistant and
secondly it won't clog your pores
so i think it's a very nice thing that
it won't clog our pores
since if you are doing makeup or if you
are carrying other serums and stuff so
you need a sunscreen that won't clog
your pores moving on to the third point
it's oil free and it's paraben free now
talking about its
spf spf is our 50 and i think that's
this is the main point which
i see in a sunscreen that it's spf
should be above 50
then only i move on to seeing other
points because if the spf is lower than
50
the sunscreen is probably not of use
also it's stabilized with helioplex
which is that
it will provide protection from both uva
and uvb rays
as the content says it says that it's
dry touch sunlock as you can read it's
dry touch
sunblock i think it's actually dried out
but
i don't know if it's because of my skin
care or um
about what it does not feel as dry
i mean i've used la shield before and
this uh this is a slightly more
hydrating and
more gives more shine to my face which
is a plus point for me
so if you have somebody if you're if
you're having oily skin and if you
really want to
look for a sunscreen which has dry touch
i think this is not the one
because this provides a very nice shine
to my face this is um
not greasy exactly but it's really
moisturizing
and it really hydrates my skin because
this is not exactly matte
or dry touch i don't know why they have
included in it or it's just my skin that
it shines on my it brings a glow to my
skin
every skin is different so i just tried
it on my skin i've been using it for one
year but
yes it does give a very nice glow to my
skin as soon as i put it
my face glows differently i mean
i don't need a serum underneath it i do
not put anything underneath it when i'm
going out
even if i'm home this is the only
product which
which is the only sunscreen which is
non-greasy but
also gives a very nice shine so i think
if you're somebody
if you're somebody with dry skin or
combination skin i think it's a very
nice try for you
all your skin types can use it in
winters so it's not exactly dry touch
uh on my skin so you can try it out
yourself
so if you're somebody with oily skin i
would recommend uh
going with la shield or any sun cross
spf 50
or any such sunscreens but not this one
because those are really
really dry touch not this one you should
apply every sunscreen 30 to 40 minutes
before the sun exposure
so i think which is applicable you can
reapply the sunscreen after every five
to six hours depending on
how much you're staying into the sun if
you're somebody with issues like
freckles or pigmentation you should use
it even if you're staying at home
because lights from our um phone screens
our tv screens our laptops are also very
very harmful
for your skin and you should use a
sunscreen
even if you are not stepping out so
that's like a rule
so yeah i'd rate it again 9 out of 10
because it is so amazing
so overall i give 9 out of 10 to the
sunscreen because
one point that i noticed was that claims
to have
like a non shiny finish and it claims
that it won't bring
any type of shine on your face it's a
dry touch but it's
not exactly a dry touch it really brings
a very nice shine to my face
which i take it as a plus point for
myself but i don't know
but in general uh that's that could be a
plus point for some of you and that
could not be a plus point for some of
you
so yeah if you have oily skin you can
definitely go for this one
in winters but you have dry skin or
combination skin you can go
you can go with this throughout the
season so like for 12 months you
this is your goat this can be your go-to
sunscreen and i love this sunscreen
i think i would highly recommend it
thank you all for watching this was it
and i'll see you in my next product
reviews please subscribe to my channel
and follow me on instagram so this was
it for today and i'll see you in my next
video bye
Neutrogena sunscreen review for this summer
Hey guys! Welcome to my channel. Today I'm going to review and test two sunscreens
from Neutrogena: the sensitive skin one and the ultra sheer- dry touch.
Let's compare these at the same time.
I'm going to start with Neutrogena sensitive
skin sunscreen. As you can see, the consistency of the sensitive skin it's
very heavy and takes longer to absorb. One thing that I noticed, this is a
sunblock, so use it after your moisturizer.
Personally, I don't like it, it's kind of messy and greasy and you can keep white
residue in some parts of my face, even if I try my best to spread it well.
In general, this sunblock is not my favorite and I don't recommend it to use it on
your face, if you have acne or oily skin.
My next review will be the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer
Dry-touch. I can tell you how lightweight this sunscreen is, after I
apply it on my face (as you can see), looks and feels very clean, no white residue and my
skin does not get oily at all. Also absorbs very fast.
Reading about the active ingredients, the Neutrogena ultra sheer
is a chemical sunscreen, this means
you have to apply this sunscreen before your moisturizer and wait about 15
minutes before any sun exposure.
In my opinion, I totally recommend this one for
people with oily skin and acne problems. In general, I'm very satisfied about this
sunscreen.
And here you have the final review about these two Neutrogena
sunscreens.
Anyways! This is all I have for today
Thank you so much for watching! I hope you guys subscribe!
Thumbs up if you like this video!
And leave me a comment about your favorite Neutrogena sunscreen.
Mine is the Ultra Sheer! See you guys next time!
Pura Vida!??????
hello and welcome back to my channel i
have my headband on so i can apply a
sunscreen
and see how it goes i
think i maybe have applied this
sunscreen once but i haven't really used
it
um this is the neutrogena sensitive skin
mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 60
plus
um this has titanium dioxide and zinc
oxide in it
it doesn't really make any claims about
being sheer
um it is supposed to be for sensitive
skin
which honestly is probably better with a
mineral sunscreen because i feel like
those are the ones where i see
the most somewhat ridiculous claims
um i do have my quarter teaspoon so
um for your face you are
supposed to use a quarter teaspoon of
sunscreen
um is the general recommendation got a
little bit too much so that's about a
quarter teaspoon
you're recommended to put another
quarter teaspoon
on your neck and ears you don't want to
forget
those areas and also around your eyes
the amount of sunscreen you're supposed
to use to get the
spf on the bottle i believe is two
milligrams per centimeter squared
i feel like i should look that up so
that i make sure that i'm actually
saying the correct amount
but that's what i think it is
so with a non-tinted mineral sunscreen
generally i expect
there to be some type of white cast i
suppose um
since i do have a fair skin tone i
guess it is more likely that i can have
it blend into my skin
okay i got it all out of there this is
the extra that i
wiped off at the beginning
and honestly i might have a smaller face
than the quarter teaspoon
like recommendation is technically four
um
but for the purposes of video i wanted
to
show you what a quarter teaspoon looks
like
since that is the recommended amount
of sunscreen to use
and i'm just gonna rub this in for a
little while and then i'll probably let
it sit
for a little bit to see if it does sink
in at all
it is um like a nice
lotiony texture it has maybe a little
bit of a sunscreen scent
um but it's not like hard to rub around
or anything like that um
i don't feel it's starting to pill um
okay so that's the sunscreen on my face
i can definitely tell that some is on my
hands so
um that's something to keep in mind when
you're applying sunscreen is
um you know you want to get enough on
your face if you're applying it with
your hands like you probably are
um some is likely going to be on your
hands so that's part of the thing that
you want to keep in mind when you're
thinking about how much you're applying
um so again like i said a quarter
teaspoon might be a little bit much for
me um
i don't know it's hard to know exactly
how big my face is
um but i do really enjoy a lab muffin
beauty science i think is her channel
and she's actually like measured her
face and i think she found that she
needs less than a quarter teaspoon
by quite a fair amount so if you do have
a smaller face
or like a similar face size to that
i think that it's reasonable to assume
that the amount that ends up on your
hands
from rubbing it in may kind of cover for
the amount that you don't need on your
face
um but regardless it's always probably
better to
lean towards a little bit more than a
little bit less but she's all
she's also talked about that as well
obviously the best sunscreen is one that
you'll wear
and applying too much can potentially
cause a problem as well
um just because you know you're wasting
money at some point um
by applying too much sunscreen and
you're losing some of that um cosmetic
elegance of it sitting on your skin
so that may make you more or may make
you less likely to
use it um and i know she did a whole
video talking about like why you
shouldn't apply
too much sunscreen either and i can't
off the top of my head think about the
other things that she
discussed um i don't know if it's
potentially more likely for it to like
transfer off your face if you have too
much on your face
um but um here's the extra amount that i
didn't apply to my face because i
overfilled the
teaspoon so
it's definitely like a nice texture i
think if i
could rub it in with like a little bit
less rubbing in um it would keep a
little bit of a nicer texture because
it's
it almost gets a little bit more it
almost loses some of its elegance as you
rub it in i can't describe exactly how
so there is it
my two hands for comparisons you can
kind of see
the white cast on my hand um there
definitely is a little bit there for me
it's kind of like a pinkish
tint that i think is there on my skin
so straight off the bat
i don't know if this is a nano
zinc oxide or not in it
but the white cast doesn't look that bad
for an spf 60 plus
mineral only sunscreen um obviously like
this isn't a good like it's not good to
have white gas
but um it's not the worst
that i've seen i'm going to let it sink
in for a little bit i'm going to go
check the mirror and see if i have any
like streaks that i need to blend a
little bit better
and then i will come back and see what
it looks like in about like 10
15 minutes to see if there's any fading
of the white cast in that amount of time
okay so i have given this about 15
minutes to
kind of do its thing see if the white
cast
did dissipate at all and i went and got
a mirror
so this definitely does still have a
white cast
i think the areas that are the worst
i mean my hairline um so you know maybe
more caution when you're blending there
yeah i mean it's just kind of a general
layer of a
a light white cast on the skin so i did
look this up on neutrogena's website
it does say it's an oil-free sunscreen
lotion for sensitive skin goes on evenly
absorbs quickly and feels ultra light
um it does feel pretty light like i
don't know feel a noticeable difference
on my skin
it does still feel just a slight bit
tacky
but i'm not seeing it transfer to my
fingers really when i
touch my face and then look at my
fingers so
it might dry down a little bit more too
but that's about where it's at right now
this is not
marketed as a facial sunscreen on their
website
um but it doesn't say like apply to the
body
or versus the face either so do without
what you will
it does say water resistant for 80
minutes
paba free i'm not sure what that is if
that's parabens of some type maybe
hypoallergenic which i don't know what
that means in a sunscreen
oil free fragrance free free of dyes
oils and irritating chemical ingredients
but i mean what are irritating chemical
ingredients because
like there's plenty of things i mean
everything is a chemical i guess maybe
they mean
it doesn't have chemical sunscreen
ingredients not really sure
um what exactly they mean by about that
and um they are selling it for 11.50 for
three ounces
via the neutrogena website
honestly i do think that this is um
better i've been trying out the cetaphil
sunscreens they're
mineral sunscreens that i think are
maybe newer
to them and this one is not bad so far
i'll definitely keep testing it and put
maybe a pinned comment
with um how it is with more extended use
or maybe there will just be a
more in this video after i finish
talking right now
of me coming back and checking in on
another day but i feel like i could see
this working for people if you don't
mind having some of that white cast
and like covering it up with makeup or
maybe a tinted sunscreen
which definitely is an option
i do think the white cast on this is not
the worst one
that i've had and it doesn't feel drying
um
or like irritating in any way it doesn't
feel too heavy anything like that
so i feel like this could potentially
work for people
um if you want to put in the work for a
mineral sunscreen
it doesn't specifically say that it's
non-nano zinc but i don't think there's
any requirement
to say either way so
i'm not sure on that what i do like
about it is that it isn't
a very matte finish i wouldn't say it's
super dewy or hydrating either it's just
kind of
natural maybe leaning a little bit more
hydrating but
it just overall feels fine on my skin it
doesn't feel bad in any way
um so i'll definitely keep testing this
and let you know what i think
um after some more time but so far
it's not the worst
not the best so thank you so much for
watching i'm going to be doing more of
these drugstore sunscreen videos so
if you have any sunscreens you'd like to
see applied or hear more about
any pros and cons definitely let me know
in the comments or you can check out my
other videos that i've already done
reviewing skincare products like
sunscreens
if that's interesting to you i do also
do empties videos where i'll tend to get
reviews of a lot of products that i've
actually used up completely
or if i have used up a product partially
and i just can't get it to work for me
and i'm getting rid of it
um so if you like to see reviews of
things like that
you can go ahead and check those videos
out as well and i hope to see you
in my next video bye so i have tried the
sunscreen a little bit more
and i'll go ahead and apply some on my
hand and talk about
a little bit more information so when i
first
apply this sunscreen it can feel a
little bit heavy um
on the skin almost like it's suffocating
my skin a little
i get a little bit hot um just from the
feeling on my face like it doesn't feel
hot
uh just when i apply it it does feel
heavy but
after a little bit of time you know 15
20 minutes it feels pretty normal i
don't really notice it on my skin
the sunscreen throughout the day when
i'm wearing it
doesn't feel super heavy or anything it
just feels
um neutral and it does kind of have a
neutral finish as well
it looks a little bit shiny here but
that pretty much dissipates and it has a
neutral finish as i wear it during the
day
it does however have that white cast um
i find that if i don't do a good job
blending it in
it will be a little bit streaky so you
do want to make sure that you're
you know checking how well you applied
it and everything like that
um so you don't get a white cast that's
as bad
i think it looks much better if your
white cast is um smooth versus streaky
but overall you know this applies over
itself fine i don't have any pilling
issues
um it's you know not the worst
high spf mineral sunscreen that i've
tried um
just because it does have that neutral
finish and the white cast isn't
extremely pronounced um and
it feels fairly neutral on the skin
not too heavy um not too
dewy or greasy or matte everything is
just
pretty neutral with it so overall i
think this is fine i will say it's not
very sweat resistant
i don't know if that's different from
water resistance but if i sweat it will
uh become more white and run with the
sweat
to an extent on my skin uh but overall i
didn't have any issues
with using this and i'll
continue doing so and update you if
there are any changes
i plan to do a roundup video of
drugstore sunscreens at some point so
i'll talk further about it then
hi guys i'm anisha and welcome back to
my channel
today in this video i'm going to review
two very popular neutrogena sunscreens
which you can find literally everywhere
so one of these is a physical or a
mineral based sunscreen the other one is
a chemical sunscreen
we start off by knowing what exactly is
the difference between physical
sunscreen and a chemical sunscreen
and then we'll move on to my opinion
about these and what i would recommend
depending upon your skin type and other
skin issues
so let's get started so talking about
physical sunscreens they use
mineral chemical filters which are zinc
oxide or titanium dioxide or sometimes
both so how this works is it creates a
physical barrier upon the skin
and it reflects the uv rays so it
creates like a shield on the surface of
the skin
and whereas chemical sunscreens it use
chemical uv filters
most common are octane oxide oxybenzone
and
arrow benzone etc so what it does it it
absorbs the uv rays and converts it into
heat which is then released by our skin
physical sunscreens are generally
thicker they are hard to blend
and they will give you a white cast on
your face
also these are recommended to people
with sensitive skin or rosacea prone
skin etc
whereas chemical sunscreen will be
generally lighter
it will be easier to blend won't give
you a white cast which is a great point
and is recommended to people
with oily skin and usually deeper skin
tones so that it won't
give a white cast so more or less these
were the basic differences between a
physical and a chemical sunscreen
now let's move on and look at the
products the first one i have is this
the neutrogena shear zinc dry touch
sunscreen with spf 50 plus and pa
plus it is an 80 ml bottle which retails
for 850 rupees and this one
is targeted to people with sensitive
skin
so this one is a physical sunscreen or a
mineral based sunscreen and the mineral
used is zinc oxide
now zinc oxide is a really great
ingredient as it gives protection
against all forms of uva and uvb
rays and other environmental damages so
you will get a broad spectrum protection
also the other good thing about this one
is that it is fragrance free
and hypoallergenic so it will be great
for people with sensitive skin or
actually
any skin type for that matter the
downside though is that
that it is a little bit thick it's not
greasy but you'll have to take your time
to work it in your skin
the other thing is that it will give you
a good amount of white cast
though it is true for all zinc based
sunscreens you'll have to make it a
point
because we have indian skin tones and we
don't want to look like ghosts
the trick is to take a little bit and
apply it work it in your skin then take
another bit and work it in your skin
like you're layering your sunscreen
the other thing that you can do is if
you do wear makeup you can add a little
bit of
darker colored foundation or cc cream
with it so that it becomes a tinted
sunscreen if that makes sense and it
won't
give you a white cast that bad the other
one is the neutrogena ultra shear dry
touch sunblock
with spf 50 plus pa triple plus now this
one is 88
ml and it retails for 550 rupees
this one it says that it has helioplex
technology
which represents a breadth of stabilized
sunscreens engineered to deliver broad
spectrum protection
now keep in mind that this is a chemical
sunscreen
and chemical uv filters often provide
protection against either uva
or uvb rays they are also very weak and
photo unstable
so what would brands do is they would
mix in three or more of these different
chemical uv filters
engineer it to be stable and work
properly together
so that the product gives a broad
spectrum protection
i leave the names of the uv filters used
in this one on the screen somewhere
as it is a chemical sunscreen it will be
lighter on the skin
it will be easier to blend and it won't
give you a white cast
which is great but the problem arises
with the chemical uv filters
there are a few concerns well with
oxybenzone in particular so let's see
what these are
number one is that our skin absorbs
these ingredients
the traces of these chemical uv filters
have been found in human breast milk
urine
and blood now it is said that this can
be
potentially disrupt the hormones of our
body
but it is not clinically significant as
to what extent
but due to these concerns it is
advisable for women that are pregnant
or who are breastfeeding to avoid the
use of physical sunscreens
number two oxybenzone is allergenic and
can cause skin reactions such as redness
and itchiness
if you do already have a sensitive skin
it is advisable to
not use a chemical sunscreen and move to
a physical sunscreen instead
and number three it is believed that
oxybenzone and other chemical uv filters
can potentially harm the ocean
by damaging the coral reef now some
places like hawaii have even
banned the sales of sunscreens that use
that are formulated with these chemical
uv filters
now there is no such pan in india but it
is advisable for people that are surfers
diverse swimmers or just people visiting
the beaches to use a physical
or mineral based sunscreen instead so
apart from the debatable
chemical uv filters this as most of the
other neutrogena products
also contains undisclosed fragrance now
fragrance can give you a sensorial
experience
but it's not good for your skin and
especially in a formula like
sunscreen which you do have to reapply
every two to three hours
and in a good amount it's not good for
your skin
okay so once more let's do a quick
comparison between the two
this is a physical sunscreen this one is
a chemical sunscreen this has zinc oxide
this has other chemical uv filters
this one is cheaper it won't give you a
white cast
this will give you a white cast it is a
little bit
thick and this one
has no fragrance this one has fragrance
so final thoughts i have purchased both
of them and i use both of them
but if i do have to recommend you one i
would suggest you go for the sheer zinc
one
i know it will give you a white cast and
deeper the complexion
severe the white cast but again this is
safer
the formulation is better it is a little
bit thick but it's not greasy and it
will work on all skin types
i'm going to leave it on that and well
you can
make your own decision yourself you can
pick the one that better suits you

thank you and bye
hey guys so today i'm talking all about
neutrogena sunscreen
there are 52 neutrogena sunscreen
options to choose from right now
yes 52. that is super overwhelming why
exactly are there so many options
i went through every single one of the
52 options and reviewed the ingredients
i've personally tested a large majority
of these over the years
and then again recently in my research
for this topic and now i'm here to
decode all of the neutrogena sunscreen
options in this video
let me tell you of these 52 sunscreen
options there are really only a small
number that i actually recommend
and personally use and the rest i do
not recommend and i will tell you all
about it so watch this video all the way
through and you will easily understand
how to sort through these options and
ultimately
land on a product that's right for you
in your family now many of the things
that i will talk about and teach you
about
in this video today can relate to other
sunscreen brands as well
so what you learn here today will also
be able to help you pick out
the best sunscreens from other competing
brands but why should you listen to me
on this topic i'm a board certified
dermatologist and this is my lane
i have been researching sunscreens and i
talk about them to my patients every
single
day i believe sunscreen is an important
part of our daily skin care routine
so we need to find one that we like and
that we trust
and we'll use consistently if this is
your first time on my channel
welcome i'm dr marin locke better known
here on youtube as the budget
dermatologist

skin on a budget

you don't miss any videos
give them a thumbs up if you like them
and if you want even more content from
me follow me along on some of my other
social media accounts that i always link
below so come say hi
so neutrogena is one of the most
well-known and long-standing brands in
the skincare industry
specifically for sunscreen products i
love this brand
because it's affordable and widely
available
i believe that quality skincare products
especially sunscreens
should be accessible for all with that
said neutrogena has
way too many sunscreen options when
looking at their website right now
you will see 52 unique sunscreen options
to choose from so how will the average
consumer who hops on their website or
stops by the drugstore to grab some
sunscreen on the way to the beach
know which one to choose which one is
good for the face
which one is good for the body which one
should you use on your baby or child
and which one should you wear with
makeup and which one should you wear to
the beach or swimming or does it even
matter is it all just marketing on the
packaging
as a practicing dermatologist i get
asked these questions
all the time and patients ask me for my
personal recommendations
of brands as well as specific products
within those brands
so i really spend a lot of time on this
topic and
after reviewing all 52 sunscreens on the
neutrogena website
here is my breakdown of the hits and the
misses for you
but first the basics neutrogena offers
sunscreen
in three main categories you have
lotions
sprays and sunscreen sticks you will
have the most
options to choose from in lotions then
sprays
and the least amount of options in
sticks so this choice really comes down
to user preference
as a general rule myself and most
dermatologists recommend lotions
as these tend to be more effective
sticks can also be effective if applied
in an appropriate quantity and sprays
are generally the least effective as
coverage tends to be much less than
recommended so
deciding on this category is one of the
first steps in selecting your sunscreen
the other big choice that you have to
make is choosing between a chemical
versus a mineral sunscreen now i'm not
going to get
too in-depth about the formulation of
sunscreens in this video but instead
i'll just tell you a few key points
about chemical versus mineral sunscreens
just enough info so that you can choose
which one you prefer and ultimately
you will understand my final
recommendations okay so chemical
sunscreens
use chemicals to protect your skin from
the sun
they work by absorbing the uv radiation
in the harmful spectrum
and they convert it to low energy heat
which dissipates and prevents sun damage
compare this to mineral sunscreens
which use minerals to protect you from
the sun now the mineral sunscreens sit
on top of the skin and reflect the
sunlight
off rather than absorbing it you can
tell which type of sunscreen it is
by flipping it over and looking at the
back on the ingredients label
under active ingredients you will see
either chemicals
or minerals or a combination of both
listed here
so there are six chemicals commonly used
in sunscreens in the united states
examples of these include oxybenzone and
avobinzone which are really commonly
used
in our sunscreens and there are two
mineral blockers that are available in
the us
in sunscreens and these are zinc oxide
and titanium dioxide so both chemicals
and minerals are very effective
at broad spectrum coverage meaning they
protect against uva
and uvb rays so what do i recommend
chemical or mineral
here's the deal chemical sunscreens have
the most
controversy surrounding them for four
main
reasons that is alarming to the public
first
there is evidence from a study published
in jama which is a major medical journal
that chemicals in sunscreens
specifically oxybenzone
is absorbed into the blood in high
quantities when applied to the skin
for sun protection so this finding was
very alarming for the public and it
stirred up a lot of controversy
the problem with this isolated finding
is that we don't know
the true significance of this finding
yes
it is found in the blood but does its
brief presence there
cause any harmful long-term effects we
need more research to really understand
the full picture here
but nonetheless these findings have
really reinvigorated a war
on sunscreen especially chemical
sunscreens
second the oxybenzone chemical that is
found in so many sunscreens
is thought by some to be an endocrine
disruptor which means it affects the
hormones in our bodies this claim came
about from studies
done in lab settings we need further
studies to fully understand
and to clarify its association with
hormone disruption in children and
adults
but until then it remains approved for
use in
many products but this unsubstantiated
effect in human subjects with
topical use is enough to make some
people wary
about its use so rather than wait for
confirmatory studies
people are rejecting its use altogether
now as a better safe than sorry approach
and that's totally fine i get that third
chemicals
and sunscreens have been known to cause
allergic reactions
so many people find that they break out
into a rash when they use a sunscreen
there are many ingredients that are
commonly found in sunscreens that may be
the culprit for the rash
but the chemical sunblockers are on the
top of the list for the most frequent
offenders for that reason
many people will avoid chemical
sunscreens and instead
opt for mineral ones which have
less chance of causing rashes on the
skin and fourth
there is some controversy about
oxybenzone destroying coral reefs so you
will see
a new marketing push of reef safe
sunscreens
that are formulated without this
chemical so for all of those reasons
chemical sunscreens are controversial
and leads many people
to refuse them all together and opt for
only physical or
mineral sunscreens so mineral sunblocks
like i mentioned sit on top of the skin
they have only inorganic non-absorptive
blockers
in them that aren't likely to be
absorbed in the bloodstream in the same
way the chemicals are
and these minerals are far less likely
to cause rashes on the skin
so far it seems like mineral sunscreens
are slam dunk why do chemical sunscreens
even exist
it's because of the cosmetic appeal of
the chemical sunscreens
so these chemical sunscreens are way
more user-friendly as i like to say so
they rub
in more easily they can also be removed
in the shower more easily they can blend
into the skin more easily be worn under
makeup and in
general are great at blocking the sun
now mineral blockers
are notorious for leaving that white
cast
look on the skin they are harder to rub
in and to remove
and they can be tough to wear under
makeup for some people so
newer technology has helped improve this
and also
some brands will add a tent or color to
their sunscreen to help decrease this
white cast
to some extent so it really just comes
down to a pro versus con situation
in choosing the sunscreen that's right
for you and it's a personal decision
so what do i use i stick to mineral
sunscreens as much as possible
and i recommend mineral sunscreens
exclusively
for babies and children as well as
pregnant and nursing mothers
as these chemicals have been found in
mother's bre"
I don’t think you’re applying too much, the bottle says to apply liberally. Neutrogena made a new sunscreen called Hydroboost and it’s a gel cream and it’s soooooo light weight and it’s moisturizing but not oily or thick. I love it so much!!🙈



NEVER AGAIN!! This sunscreen has a BAD white cast
You applied too much girl
Plz wish one is better for oily sensitive skin
You&#39;re applying to much..... 😒😒
Mujhe dry scene kilia ak sunscreen Ki Naam bolis plz plz🙏
This is interesting it&#39;s nice how doro always always try new things and always knows that we all love her and she&#39;s such a good positive person I love it one of my favorite YouTube&#39;s and I&#39;m a girl using my dad&#39;s account just to let you know✅😁❤
Thank you so much....you are not like others who just keep promoting stuff for money  .....i love that 😍

Iam 15 years old can i use nutregena ultra sheer dry touch
I m putting garnier cream in summer and boroplus cream in winter 😂😂😂🤭

Hey is neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch sunblock good for acne and pores???

People should appreciate mineral sunscreens even if they leave a white cast! Unlike chemical sunscreens they don&#39;t get accumulated in your blood so they&#39;re beneficial in the long run

My skin is oily and sensitive so much pimple, spots <br>Can I use both of my face?

Sunscreen just use a small amount
will this help prevent me tanning

Is the neutrogena ultra sheer ok for combination skin ?



If yu ll use that much of sunsceen then it ll never get blend on face, wheather its nutrogena or something else,this way u can&#39;t review a beauty product
This is not a foundation,u shouldn&#39;t be applying like that,grow up girl
Damn. That&#39;s too much
Lol. You don&#39;t know how to apply.
Seriously....? Is that the way to apply sunscreen? Really? Horrible.. Soo pathetic.. 😔 😔
can I use compact powder after applying the cream
This is not shaving cream babe!! <br>Apply it like a sunscreen

It looks bad before you out way tooo much!
What&#39;s wrong with u? U used too much product 😑😑😑😑😫
This is toooooo much
U&#39;re applying too much
You are adorable😘😘😘

Are u a fool? No one applies that much of a sunscreen 😏
is this for oily skin can i use this ?






The recommended amount (although everyone needs a different amount) of sunscreen should only be a nickel size. Although it says to apply liberally, going a little heavy-handed can cause a white cast. I recommend dotting sunscreen over your whole face little by little, lightly tapping or massaging until an even white cast appears over the whole face, and then massage it in to minimise the cast.


I am using itbfor more than 8 years, i never had this issue. This girl applying half of the bottle and wants the cream to absorb immediately. Pls dont follow her review
U applied it like a pack
Great rewew

I have very sensitive skin, oily, acne prone.. if the breeze blows too hard on my face, pimples pimples and more pimples... I don’t eat greasy food nor consume added sugar, I drink lots of water, I just give entirely up! I need a new face 😩😩

Does it prevent tanning!? Please respond!

Im in love with ua eyes gal😍
Nice review.. Suscribed your channel hope you will help me back

I have so sansitive skin + dry and also paigmantation😢😢😢  can I use this😢😢 please reply and help mee



Who applies that much of sunscreen????

Does this have any fragrance?

Yar bnda thora lagaye had hai
Wear the sunscreen before moisturize? U sure? Teach me i just bought this

Can we apply fairness cream over sunscreen?

take a lil amt and apply gently gurl... tats not ur food its a cream😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do this sunscreen has any expiry date written on it bcz as per google information this sunscreen doesn&#39;t provide the information about its packing date and expiry date so u never know when will it expire plzz tell me is it wrong or right as bcz otherwise it can be too dangerous hope for you to reply ...





😊😊

you put it too much..
I guess to each it’s own because this neutrogena shit nearly blind  me I literally was so piss off I wore it twice and both time was the worse experience fever .if every sunscreen was the same I’d take the damage Over this torture any day .when u have things to do u. Don’t have time to apply this crap on and wait till your eyes stop burning for few hrs smh  it’s the worse for me and a lot of people there’s something in it am totally allergic with it’s actually hazard .

You should NOT put chemical sunscreens on before moisturizer. Sunscreen is the last step regardless if it’s chemical or physical. If you call neutrogena, they will tell you the same thing.



i have very dry skin..which sunscreen should I wear?cause every sunscreen leaves white residue on face plus it just stays there not infused in skin properly

Thnk u Mam😘😘
i hv oily skin so wch1 is gud for me??
