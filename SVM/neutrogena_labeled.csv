What I love about this sunscreen is that Unlike many other products that claim to control oil this actually makes me less oily and stays matte for a long time Goes well under a little makeupWhat I hate Burns around the eyes especially when I wash it off Its very hard to spread and you need time to work it on sometimes it pills and sticks to baby hairs Leaves a bit of a white cast Its not too obvious on my light medium skin tone but I wouldnt recommend this for tan or deep skin tones,0.044,0.066,0.89,-0.2668,Negative
It works well and doesnt feel greasy or look shiny  BUT I would not advise using it on your forehead if youll be sweating I dont know about swimming because it WILL run and get in your eyes and it WILL NOT feel good  Yes this is true of many sunscreens but this one seems to be worse than average in this regardSo yes use it  It works  Its good  But be aware you may need to use a different product above the eyes,0.092,0.138,0.77,-0.6657,Negative

This sunscreen is definitely not for oily skin easy to spread but stinks the eye area a little bit You need to try it first to see if its really suitable for you Also it doesnt leave white cast,0.121,0.06,0.819,0.1336,Positive

it is a sunscreen but more so for the beach It DOES leave a white cast on dark skin but it is minimal I used with a light moisturizer and this somehow made my face feel DRYER than before it spreads with difficulty,0.0,0.106,0.894,-0.5267,Negative
Only sunscreen that doesnt make your skin oily Some sunscreens by time becomes caky or oily but this one by time makes my face better I even use it in the evening when there is no sun But since they changed formula it started to leave white cast when applied big amount You need precisely control the amount you put,0.06,0.064,0.876,0.1901,Positive

I was looking for sunblock to use while walking around my city not the beach This sunblock is works great is fragrance free and feels light weight  The only negative is that it is thick to apply a white cream that you will really need to rub in well I wish they could make this in clear  Otherwise a good purchase that does not turn your skin albino weight as the chemical frees tend to do,0.227,0.042,0.731,0.9349,Positive

I dont know why I had problems with this sunscreen which has chemical filters It shouldnt have had a cast but DID on me Asian I found it so hard to spread evenly and it does not dry down SHEER you have to really work it out to get it even because you will be left with white streaks if you dontEven when I did apply it evenly I still looked a little like a ghostI bought this to travel to Colorado which is soo dry but if really wasnt moisturizing almost a little drying which makes sense because IT IS for people with more oily skin However MY PROBLEM was that when I applied it over moisturizer sometimes it piled or left more intense white streaks on my face,0.037,0.068,0.895,-0.6248,Negative
My husband hates lotion Sunscreen hand cream whatever  if it gets rubbed into skin he hates it We recently took a trip to Disney and I brought this along for my own use because Im prone to breakouts and this ended up being our familys default sunscreen for the trip It rubs in easily smells mild and we had zero sunburns despite being out for hours at a time for an entire week at a theme park We used most of the tube over the week of travel which isnt bad for three people with multiple applications a day Im definitely getting this again to use all summer long,0.097,0.05,0.853,0.6542,Positive

I have pretty durable and unsensitive skin ie my skin doesnt flare up burn or itch to most products but am horrendously prone to acne and hyperpigmentation and most sunscreens are really thick and make my face feel pretty sealed up and unbreathable This sunscreen is probably the best Ive come across so farIt still has the usual odor and consistency of typical sunscreens although it is slightly more fluid and subtle so a small amount can be applied easily and my skin can still breathe Once applied it does leave a little bit of a shine but not nearly as much as regular sunscreens but I think thats a fair trade for protected skin A thin layer of it wont leave your skin looking whitepale either but an ample or generous amount will ample being a teaspoonfullApplying makeup after isnt any issue either granted that you either rub the sunscreen in thoroughly and allow at least of couple of minutes for it to settle I use liquid foundation but for those who use powders you might have to wait longer for it dryAs stated in the description application is necessary at least every 2 hours or every 80 minutes if youre in water or sweatingI prefer to wash it off as soon as Im no longer outdoors but I have left it on for an extended period 67 hours and didnt feel my skin becoming too oily as it would with any other sunscreen I didnt break out from it either which is a plus and Ive been using it almost every dayFYI for sunscreens in general many common ingredients of sunscreen like avobenzone and homosalate included in this product as well are good at either filtering blocking or absorbing UV UVA UVB rays which is great but I would highly recommend washing it off as soon as you no longer need the protection Like everything else in this world the sunscreen isnt infinite  its made of molecules and chemicals that will break down into other compounds These ingredients in sunscreen have been found to breakdown into a variety of organic compounds some of which that can cause cancer  Im not saying that this guaranteed and will happen to you but be wary of leaving it on your face for extended periods of time I dont know the details of how long these ingredients typically last in their intact UV protecting state but by guessing from the product description stating that it should be reapplied at least every 2 hours my guess would be that  a couple hours So overall just make sure youre cleaning it off properly Cleansing oils and cleansing balms are useful for removing oilbased materials like sunscreen,0.134,0.043,0.823,0.9931,Positive

I ordered this product because I was looking for a sunscreen that didnt have Oxybenzone in it It causes hormone disruption in humans affecting estrogen production particularly in women and testosterone production in men It also bleaches coral reefs and can cause mortality in fish Now think about that being absorbed into your skin not so good rightAnyway thats why I went for this because its FREE of oxybenzone and much more affordable than others options such as Paulas choice which has an Oxybenzonefree sunscreen too Please note from what I can gather its only the SPF 30 that is free of it not the SPF 55The product is oil free so its great for oily skin and Ill say once its dried in it doesnt feel very moisturising it has a dry feel to it probably because its mineral basedOverall Im giving it a 45 its a GREAT price that is free of a toxic chemical also linked to cancer with a reasonable SPF level Definitely a great daily sun screen that doesnt break me out It looks like it will have a white cast but if you blend it in that disappears Ill update this tomorrow with its compatibility with makeup cause Ill be putting some under my foundation and seeing how it feels,0.106,0.082,0.812,0.3285,Positive

I just had a Dermal Cell removed and needed to make sure this doesnt happen again I never used sunscreen on my face since my makeup had it But its so important to use a sunscreenblock before adding your makeup for double protection This Neutrogena cream goes on smoothly and disappears into the skin Then the makeup just glides right over  This says its clear but its white It still blends right in with no white residue or shine just a nice matte finish  Ill be buying more,0.121,0.099,0.78,0.2958,Positive
First time using this brand wanted to compare it to a tinted mineral sunscreen I also bought I favor the tinted one Australian Gold but this one worked amazing well for being outside at a water park all day for July 4 I applied it two or three times and my face was wonderfully tan but not burned whatsoever I am fair skinned with an olive skin tone Need to rub this sunscreen in more than the other brand I tried One thing I did notice is that this one made my face feel prickly not super fun but half the people who used it that day in my group also felt that slight burning sensation Im not sure if thats a sensitivityallergy to some ingredient in it but it didnt leave any weird redness or marks on my skin no breakouts no sunburn and the feeling went away after a few minutes All in all pretty happy that I brought that along,0.173,0.098,0.729,0.9317,Positive

I was looking yet again for a facial sunscreen for summer to use under makeup  Im not very faithful about using sunscreen  I know I should be yet living up north and being one who stays indoors a lot I dont worry about it like I should  But when summer comes I try to wear one most days  But I hate the way they feel and every year I am on the hunt for one that is not greasy or heavy wont cause breakouts and works well under makeup  And is not expensive to boot  That seems to be a really hard combination to find  The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer is sort of close but  I still find it feels to greasy and heavy on my skin  I gave this one a try this year and I really like it As I apply it I feel like oh no this is going to be greasy and heavy too  But no as soon as I am done applying it disappears  I really dont feel it on my skin after that  It doesnt leave a white cast once it is applied and it works well under my makeup  It seems to offer great sun protection  I am very fair and burn easily and I have had no problems  It is a generously sized tube for the price  I use it on my neck and chest as well  I have had no problem with my eyes stinging as I use it under them  Of course I am careful not to get it my eyes  No new pimples since using it no rashes or other irritation either  I think its a good product and I recommend it,0.142,0.132,0.726,0.3,Positive
Ive been using Neutrogena Ultra Sheer DryTouch Sunblock on my face for a few years it is really good  But when I saw this Clear Face version I decided to try it  I actually prefer this Clear Face because it is so sheer feeling  oilfree  They are NOT the same product and feel different when appliedI like it because it disappears in to my skin leaving it matte not shiny at all  The Ultra Sheer is a bit more like a lotion Its not greasy but does leave a feeling of lotion on my face  This Clear Face is so light I hardly know Im wearing it  Even my husband likes it  that is saying something because he is not a lotionontheface kind of guy  And there is virtually no scent which is great since its on your face where you really notice scentWhen you first put this on its quite whitewatery  you may think its a disaster but just lightly smooth it in  it disappears quickly  And it does block the sun  I have no burning when I wear this sunscreenIf you have sensitive skin this may not be the product for you  I felt a slight burning sensation when I applied it  It went away quickly but I could see that being a problem for some people  I also got a little on my lips  they still felt slightly irritated the next day  The ingredient list is interesting  includes cinnamomum zeylanicum bark extract which is from the cinnamon tree and cedrus atlantica bark extract which is from a cedar tree  Both have antiseptic properties which is probably why they are in this clear face lotion  But they can also cause irritation so if you have very sensitive skin beware The Neutrogena Ultra Sheer DryTouch Sunblock does not contain either of those ingredients and may be a better choice for you,0.131,0.098,0.77,0.9104,Positive

If youre using powerful retinoids you must also use sun protection every single day My son has acne so we had to be sure that we chose something effective that wouldnt cause breakouts This Neutrogena sunscreen doesnt irritate his skin and its clear and undetectable so he doesnt feel weird having stuff on his face Id recommend for anyone prone to breakouts,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.9343,Positive

I love Neutrogena products I know I can always trust them This product doesnt clog my pores which is important since I have awful acne prone skin The only reason Im giving it a 4 star is because when I use it on top of my Benzoyl peroxide it burns Bad But this could just be me unknowingly combining chemicals I dont know Ive never had this problem before But not a bad product and I definitely recommend,0.233,0.099,0.669,0.8551,Positive
Ive trusted many Neutrogena products for about 30 years now especially Norwegian Formula hand cream in winterMy dermatologist recommends this so he didnt have to twist my arm The primary thing that I like is that it spreads easily Im sure it does the trick on sunblocking but I have no way of claiming its SPF properties,0.175,0.063,0.761,0.6036,Positive

I really really wanted to like this as much as the majority of reviewers seem to unfortunately however in my opinion this did not live up to the hype Dont get me wrong it wasnt terrible it just wasnt great either For reference I have very oily acneprone skinPROS Offers hardcore broadspectrum protection with myriad types of sunscreens Doesnt leave a white cast Nice consistency light feeling Works well under makeup and with other products Decent priceCONS All of the sunscreens used are chemical sunscreens which is a bit odd since physical sunscreens are less irritating than chemical ones and as all acneprone people know irritation leads to breakouts Moreover not only is zinc oxide a physical sunscreen nonirritating and noncomedogenicnonacnegenic it can actually help to treat and prevent breakouts So its odd that they didnt use it in this sunscreen for acneprone skin and instead exclusively used sunscreens that at best are irritating and at worst comedogenic which is the opposite of what this product is supposed to do Probably because of the aforementioned point this sunscreen seemed to be no better at preventing breakouts than any other facial sunscreen Its not really any worse than most other facial sunscreens either however considering that its primary claim is that it wont cause breakouts its frustrating that thats not the case The claim that this leaves your skin matte is complete bs at least in my experience In fact literally just now as I was writing this review my boyfriend asked me if Im okay because my face is so shiny that it looks like Im drenched with sweat Awesome NOT the look I was going for This could easily be something that only I experience but for me if I use this sunscreen multiple days in a row my skin starts burning like crazy when I put it on Not sunburning mind you but really harsh stinging as though Ive just had an intense chemical peel or am using a heavyduty retinoid Not sure what causes it to burn like that because my skin is by no means sensitive Because of this I alternate it with another sunscreen and use it only every other day or every third dayFinal note Of course skin care products work differently on different people Obviously this product worked very well for the majority of reviewers So Id recommend giving it a chance even though I personally was not wowed,0.125,0.083,0.792,0.9281,Positive

I am happy that I purchased this item I have a medium to darkskinned complexion with a mix of tzone oil and dryness in the other areas of my face I am giving this information because I find it useful to know the skin type and complexion when I purchase an item I used to use the Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 for years to help with my hyperpigmentation but then I stopped because I relocated to the northwest where it was more shaded and rainy and it also left my face feeling greasy throughout the day even under my makeup However let me tell you that the suns rays still penetrated the clouds and I began to experience hyperpigmentation again in my face So I switched to this product the Neutrogena Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen for AcneProne Skin Broad Spectrum SPF 55 I LOVE IT There is a slight white film that is on the face after the initial application but it fades quickly The sunblock is thick a little goes a long way it works well whether I wear makeup and it does not seem to encourage the oil I doubt a greasy nose or tzone will ever change for me but I use other products to reduce it  I am delightedI hope this review helps someone else,0.129,0.048,0.823,0.9572,Positive
This product dries fast and never travels into my eyes like the gooey sunscreens do  I apply makeup over it  The makeup also has a little sunscreen so Im protected to 50 SPF total  This product also feels good on my neck hands and arms  Im super careful now and wear sunscreen almost everyday except when I go out at night because I had THREE surgeries in seven wks to remove basal cell carcinoma off the end of my nose and two more surgeries to successfully graft skin to cover the hole  like a sunroof on the end of my nose  Ive worn sunscreen since the 1970s and no one in my family has had cancer so I didnt think Id get it  WRONG  Did you know you can get the harmful rays THROUGH the drivers side window even if its tinted  Thats why so many facial and neck skin cancers are on the LEFT side  This product doesnt cause breakouts which is another problem I had with oily sunscreens  This is the 4th container Ive purchased because my husband wears it also EVERYDAY,0.1,0.077,0.823,0.5732,Positive

I have tried many sunscreens from different brands in different countries and have found this one as the best one for daily use It absorbs nicely and leaves no greasyshiny finish It is also very comfortable to wear even in warm weather making it easy to reapply as often as one should I have tried the 30spf and 55spf and find the latter to burn a bit when my skin is irritated due to the acne products I use Nonetheless this always goes away have not experienced this with the 30 one Be aware that it will burn A LOT if it gets in your eyes as any American sunscreen tbh Using a kids sunscreen around the eyes solves the problem,0.134,0.06,0.806,0.8655,Positive

I bought this product and was skeptical because I have can prone skin and most sunscreen is very oily My skin becomes red very easily and I am usually hesitant to try new products This has become my favorite face product and has actually helped my acne It is not oily at all in fact I apply it twice daily once in the morning and in the afternoon My face usually becomes very red or pink from the sun which would irritate my skin Since I started using this I have had less acne and I notice the texture of my skin is better My smile lines have even faded a bit since the sun protection is great I have not burned at all with this product and I have spent long days in intense sun while wearing it It does not make my skin look pale after application either You should absolutely buy this product,0.103,0.044,0.853,0.8553,Positive

I never write reviews but I am a bit skeptical about this product On the left is one I purchased from a store in person maybe CVS and the one on the right is from Amazon The one I purchased in person is one Ive been using for a while and it works well on my skin I am a black woman and was looking for a sunscreen that doesnt make me look ashy and this works My issue with the Amazon one is that it looks like a fakeimitation and could be the reason its burning some customers who left reviews of such and has not worked for others I could be wrong but the packaging is noticeably different The image used when you want to purchase it is the same as the one I purchased in person but when it arrived the font is smaller and words are added and moved around I checked the back of the product and its all the same but the print is smaller The packaging is also slightly smaller and I dont know why and is discouraging me from using it on my skin Most importantly my face Use with caution ,0.074,0.055,0.872,0.2238,Positive

Seems to work It doesnt leave a ghostly appearance on my face like other sunscreensSmells like chemical sunscreen but that beats skin cancer thinking that smell can be offset too by laying normal face cream over itDoes make my face super shiny too butlike I said if Im going to spend time in the sun Ill use this and accept the downsides bc skin cancer would be worse,0.147,0.222,0.631,-0.894,Negative
I use this product mainly on my arms legs and body for activities in the sun It works well and affords about as much protection as one may expect from a sunscreen I work horseback in the sun and find Neutrogena products superior to other brands I have used It should be reapplied occasionally for full protection  how often depends on the activity intensity of sunlight and how much perspiration or water is involved in the activity The lotion should be used in adequate amounts it goes on smoothly and comfortably and is not greasy though any  and I mean ANY   sunscreen will affect clothing if it comesin contact with clothes regularly For my face I use Neutrogena Sport face which is thicker and lasts a bit longer The Sport Face has a higher SPF but I  dont believe there is much difference in protection above 55 NOTE No sunscreen will replace proper sun clothing such as long sleeves and a brimmed hat These are not always practical for me for example I wear a riding helmet so the sunscreen is essential Remember that a baseball cap does not protect your neck most of your face or your ears Also reflected sunlight can be as damaging as direct sun so I wear sunscreen whenever Im outdoors for more than a few minutes,0.033,0.046,0.921,-0.7074,Negative
I dont hate this sunscreen but it definitely doesnt mix well with makeup and other skincare products and pills off if you rub it in It also smells well like sunscreen It does the job but leaves you very greasy looking Good for the price though,0.231,0.079,0.69,0.8626,Positive

Ive used this sunscreen consistently for a long time and while it does do a great job of protecting your skin from the sun I find that it doesnt layer on itself super well upon reapplication This may be because of other products Im using but on me it tends to pill up When I wear makeup I experience the same thing as well I also find that sometimes it leaves a white cast even when using the proper amount It does not do much for hydration in my opinion but doesnt dry out my skin eitherIt is still a very good and cheap sunscreen however so I still recommend buying it  All skin is different,0.145,0.0,0.855,0.9447,Positive

I have been using this exact sunblock for years on my face and neck Opened the one I bought on Amazon first time doing that and it smelled different but I used it last weekend and today and my skin was not protected at all There is either something new about this formula or this isnt really neutrogena Either way I dont feel this product that I received is helping protect my skin Two stars because it didnt make my skin breakout,0.09,0.037,0.873,0.5332,Positive

Seems like a great value for the money A bit watery when squeezed out but immediately thickens up when you start to rub it in Small tint of white until you fully rub it in and then no issues Seems to be working well for me and doesnt cause any oiliness under my makeup Dries well and doesnt sit on top of your skin but without drying it out I like it better than my Murad sunscreen from Sephora,0.204,0.052,0.744,0.9138,Positive

I need to use a sunscreen with a slightly higher SPF for my hyperpigmentation I feel good about using Neutrogena product and started using this sunscreen over a year ago I have oily skin and other sunscreens have caused me to break out This one has not I cant say that it has prevented further sunspots but it has not made the existing ones ny worse so I will take that I do think that it is a little greasy when applying and it tends to make my makeup wear off soon Overall I continue to use it because it does not make my skin worse and the price is good This is actually a few dollars cheaper here than at Target,0.057,0.069,0.874,-0.5346,Negative
A safe sunscreen dont clog my pore and break me out It is more liquid compare to other neutrogena sunscreen I bought the spf 30 instead of spf 55 because this spf 30 wont sting my eyes I have combination skin and always layer sunscreen on the top of moisturizer This one works great as a daliy life sunscreen By the way I am an outsider worker that means most of my time was spend inside hourse or office In this way spf 30 is just enough for my skin protection from the sun coming through the window If you are outsider worker spf 55 is cleary a better choice,0.105,0.0,0.895,0.8934,Positive

I just discovered this last year and have been using it during the summer months  Hands down this has been the best sunscreen I have found for my face and I have tried many from European to Asian sunscreens  If you need moisturizing this is not for youI have combination skin with very oily T zone This just disappears without any residue It feels like I have nothing on  Does not sting my skin or eyes All the other neutrogena spf burned my skin briefly and stung my eyes until I couldnt wait to wash off so I was very pleasantly surprised by thisIt has the same ingredients as much more expensive anthelios melt in spf 60 sunscreen which came up best in consumer reports for sunscreen This one has less HomosalateI noticed that this is under 6 and on clearance on target I hope its not being discontinued,0.127,0.015,0.858,0.9534,Positive

This product soaks in very quickly and protects skin adequately I found it to be slightly irritating upon application because I have sensitive skin and I couldnt bring it too close to my eyes due to stinging I used it with no issues though for 3 months when I was unable to get my HG ROHTO sunscreen due to COVID and the issues with air travel from other countries Overall I would certainly repurchase the price is right but I would use it for my neck and upper body,0.041,0.041,0.917,0.0073,Neutral

This sunscreen does its job It just burnsI went through a week long elimination cycle with all of the products I use because I do use both a chemical and physical exfoliant with isotretinoin which also causes burning After winnowing down my routine to only a light nonexfoliating face wash and this sunsceeen Ive found immediate burning after placing this sunscreen over my Tzone its weirdly fine over the cheeks and neck Ive also been breaking out twice as much as normal during the two weeks Ive been using this sunscreen around the mouth where the burning is most intense but I havent seen any generalized redness I think thats the extra irritation of having to talk through a mask all dayThe product is very thick and oily but it doesnt spread great which meant I was applying a thicker layer to get full coverage When applied so thickly the sunscreen does leave a white cast It doesnt leave a cast if you really rub it in but I was unable keep willing myself to do so because of the aforementioned burning sensationOxybenzone the active ingredient does that to many people I bought this to help with lightening my acne scars and it has certainly done that but Im going to have to switch to a different type of chemical sunscreen in the future Its too bad because the price really is great but I cant do this burning and stinging everyday,0.052,0.094,0.855,-0.8869,Negative

Really good sunscreen spreads easily At the beginning it goes on white but dries clear It is not oily on the skin Only issue is that it pills and balls depending on what you have underneath I cant apply my The Ordinary Niaciamide Serum Vitamin C serum from Olehenriksen or Salicylic acid serum because it will pill However when I apply it after the Hydroboost moisturizer it goes on perfectly It is all a trial and error I have test it in UV index 8 at the beach and it has kept me from burning I highly recommend specially if your skin care in the morning is simple,0.198,0.03,0.773,0.9649,Positive
The search for nongreasy sunscreen for my face is over  This one goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy film  It completely disappears after being rubbed in no more rubbing my face raw to get the white coat of sunscreen to rub in  I use this as my daily sunscreen under makeup for everyday use  Both my daughter and I have not had any breakouts or skin irritation from its use  I have extremely sensitive skin so this was a concern for me My daughter and I both have very pale sensitive skin that freckles and burns easy  Living in Florida means we have to be very vigilant with sunscreen use to avoid looking like the alligators we share space with  I typically put it only one once during the day for normal use  I reapply every 2 hours if it is a beach or pool day  If I follow those guidelines I have not had any sunburns on areas of use  I use this only for face neck and ears and use spray on sunscreen for the rest of the body,0.059,0.057,0.885,-0.166,Negative

I bought this sunscreen with the intention of wearing it everyday as part of my skin care routine under makeup The best thing I can say about this sunscreen is that it does actually provide some protection The other positive thing I can say about it is that in the three days that I wore it it did not make me break out But there are some negatives that come along with it First off it does leave a white cast and I am quite pale to begin with It tends to break up as it wears with white chunky pieces peeling off your face My biggest issue with the sunscreen is that it burns your eyes As the day wears on your face gets oily and things start to move around If you want to spend half the day with your eyes burning this is the sunscreen for you,0.057,0.009,0.934,0.7311,Positive
Looking for a daily sunscreen to go with my eight step Korean beauty regimen Decided to try this one after reading all of the four star reviews I tried it for the first time yesterday and it was easy to apply to my face over my other products however I still needed to moisturize on top of the sunscreen which Im not sure is such a good idea and I carried that uncomfortable tight sunscreen feel and smell with me for the rest of the day After a few hours I had to wash my face and get the sunscreen off Not sure if this is going to work for my day to day and maybe I will just use on my vacation however I ordered a couple different types to try them all and compare Overall this is not a bad sunscreen at all  but definitely not the most comfortable that Ive tried and im guessing that with most of facial sunscreen products Im not going to be able to get away from that slight hint of sunscreen smell that doesnt seem to go away for a couple hours,0.069,0.046,0.885,0.5476,Positive
As a person of color it hard to find a sunscreen let alone moisturizer with a decent amount of SPF that doesnt leave me looking ashy or oily afterwards I love this product because its not too thick so I dont mind wearing makeup on top of it and its doesnt leave you looking ashy no matter how much you apply so I dont mind wearing it by itself I love and definitely will be purchasing more,0.199,0.068,0.733,0.8656,Positive
This stings my face when I put on my face  A slight sting but still  I was using Elta MD Clear before and that never felt like anything when I put it on my face  I wonder if it is because I now out Salicylic acid on my face at night  Elta MD is 35  So now I am buying the Neutrogena  Sensitve SPF60 all mineral based will see if that stings my faceI will use this up putting on my neck but not my face  Cheap sunscreen also love fragrance free,0.14,0.027,0.832,0.9183,Positive

I dont think this would be helpful for women with that incredible deep brown skin Im a bit lighter iced coffee and it doesnt leave a white cast I recommend putting it on either before or after regular face lotion so it can blend in with that layer a bit without leaving a white cast on darker women,0.116,0.0,0.884,0.6649,Positive
At first try I thought this sunscreen is it It doesnt make me shine as much and its not as greasy as the many ones Ive tried before But after a week of using this I noticed small bumps and breakouts across my Tzones if I have it on for the whole day which I found can be fixed with thorough double cleansing tea tree oil and face scrubs Overall this sunscreen is satisfactory and I think Ill keep using it until I find the perfect one for my oily skin,0.089,0.04,0.871,0.6808,Positive
I r e a l l y wanted to like this Im African American and have acneprone skin so Im picky with daily sunscreen I will say this DOESNT really leave a white cast at first if you put it on generously it almost has a primer effect I actually really like how it looks The ever so slight paleness eventually melts away However i have two MAJOR problems with this1 it makes me SUPER oily Like i can feel it on my face Kinda makes me self conscious at work cuz i just know i look like a lightbulb2 i break out like CRAZY At first i thought it was coincidental but when i really paid attention Id suddenly have 12 bumps on my face that were practically gone the next day if i promptly washed it off It says noncomedogenic but I dont really believe it I wish i couldPlus when it makes my face crazy oily it gets in my eyes and burns like madA lot of people like it but its not universally perfect,0.142,0.063,0.795,0.8773,Positive
I like that this sunscreen spreads easily and doesnt leave white marks or streaks on my face and the most important thing is that it really isfeels oil free After I apply it all over my face and neck my skin feel dry not the bad kind of dry in less than a minute and i can apply my makeup even powdered blush without worrying it will be smudgy like with other sunscreens,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.9441,Positive

I wear this every day I was really worried that it would make me break out since I have a lot of acne issues anyway and pretty sensitive skin but it didnt at all Its like a very light moisturizer so you still need to put on a moisturizer over it but its very effectiveIts also the cheapest acne free face sunscreen I could find on Amazon and thats a major plus Ive been using it for months now and still have about half left but I do only use it on my faceI have accidentally gotten it in my mouth and it tastes very bad but I think all sunscreen will do that,0.1,0.084,0.816,0.2057,Positive

another product that is supposed to be for sensative skin and burns the crap out of my face When you are supposed to apply sunscreen every two hours dont care to go through that torture I returned the product as it is not good fo my skin I did give a 4 star rating because if it didnt burn my skin it is a very nice product I ended up replacing with a mineral baby sunscreen,0.039,0.147,0.814,-0.8147,Negative

Great sunscreen for my face which tends to be on the oily side  In the past it has been difficult for me to find sunscreens that will work well for my face without being oily nor leaving whiteness as is the case with zinc oxide  I was very pleased to see that this sunscreen however worked perfectly for me  It is not greasy in any manner whatsoever and rubs in beautifully with no remaining whiteness  While using this my face has not become red in the least bit  I will have to use this for a longer period of time however to confirm that for sure  Finally I really like how this is unscented as using scented sunscreen for my face would be too overpowering,0.161,0.034,0.805,0.9564,Positive

After I used up this bottle I switched to a mineral sunscreen Nothing against this product in particular more against chemical sunscreens in general they really irritate my eyes Furthermore chemical sunscreens require diligent reapplication throughout the day that quite frankly I dont have the energy or time or money forMy personal preferences aside this sunscreen is pretty great It dries quickly but does dry slightly oilier than the mineral sunscreen that I have since started using It does well under makeup but can see this product being more ideal for someone looking for a quick application with no further fuss with appearance,0.114,0.058,0.829,0.7956,Positive
I did a long search for a good sunscreen for my face and finally found one that wasnt greasy and stayed on even after a couple trips into the water it spreads really easily and it doesnt feel like icing on your faceI would totally recommend it if you have fair skin there was no redness or skin irritation at the end of the day,0.148,0.105,0.747,0.4724,Positive
I hate putting on regular sunscreen on my face It makes my face feel greasy and I worry about breakouts caused by it My previous face sunscreen was SPF 70 I think that is too high and prevents any tanning The SPF 30 is much more reasonable but I still think it prevents tanning Ideally Id like to have SPF 15 but I dont think they make that for oilfree face sunscreenThis sun screen is a bit more runny then Ive seen before It wasnt an issue but I wasnt expecting that I love bringing this stuff on any vacation or any days where I will be outside for a prolonged period of time After application it dries quickly and feels good on my face No greasy or oily feelingProsEasy to applyDries quicklyConsDoesnt allow for maximum tanning,0.109,0.081,0.81,0.4763,Positive

I really wanted to love this sunscreen but it is just too drying for my skin Ive been using it for a couple weeks and it has been giving me dry patches on my cheeks and forehead even though I apply it OVER a moisturizer I think it could be great during the summer when my skin is more oily I have combination skin that skews a little dryer in the winter I will try it again once the weather warms up but for now I need to find a more moisturizing sunscreen,0.152,0.0,0.848,0.9341,Positive

I buy one every summer  Neutrogena products work well for me  Other sunscreens will clog my pores and cause breakouts  So I have this for face and whatever other sunscreen for body  Container seems small but its enough to get through the summer if you use it just on the face so its worth it,0.078,0.0,0.922,0.5135,Positive

Clear Face is the answer to my quest for a higher SPF facial sunscreen that doesnt liquify my makeup  leave me looking shiny within an hour  It applies smoothly blends into skin easily  provides a moist but almost matte finish for applying make up  For the past year Id been using Neutrogenas Ultra Sheer SPF 70 which was less greasy than Olay Regenerist Broad Spectrum SPF 50 which Id used for several years but Clear Face is a much more satisfactory product  Im in my 60s but still have an oily Tzone  I do blot my face with a tissue after applying a nickelsized amount to my face  neck before applying my foundation  powder  I am hoping that it will provide sufficient moisture protection during the frigid winter months  In the meantime it has been a godsend for summer weather,0.134,0.008,0.859,0.9606,Positive

I have mild melasma darker pigmented areas on my face  Being out in the sun without protection makes the melasma spots become darker  Ive been using this sunscreen daily for six months and it has made such a difference  Even without make up on my spots are barely visible  Im not saying that wearing this sunscreen will rid you of melasma  But protecting your skin from the sun will make the darker pigmentation fade dramatically  I wear this sunscreen under my make up and it is not greasy at all  I can be outside for hours and this sunscreen does an amazing job of protecting my skin,0.049,0.0,0.951,0.7351,Positive

I recently started a new skin regimen with Curology and they suggested this as my sun screen Ive dealt with cystic acne for the last 4 years and struggled to find anything to put on my face that did not irritate and further inflame my skinThis did not break me out or irritate my skin in any way The formula is a bit greasy but it does not sit on top of my face for long My skin stays moisturized all day  Im so glad I found this product that I can use daily,0.091,0.038,0.872,0.7222,Positive

I purchased this due to the high SPF specific to face sunscreen and low price If I were to buy this same product in stores it would be around double the price I use this every morning before I got to work as a field biologist It does not leave a white residue or seem to cause any break outs I breakout normally caused by being a young woman but cant notice any more by using this product Wish they had more natural products but I guess ya get what you pay for and protection from the sun is more important,0.109,0.031,0.859,0.8318,Positive

Caveat I do NOT spend my life out in the sun So if you dont either then this sunscreen is perfect It gives reasonable SPF but the headline is how gorgeously it goes on Its so light it literally melts into your skin and only leaves a beautiful soft feeling ZERO grease ZERO sunscreen sweat when youre out in the sun  It really is a no greasy feel lotion you dont often find in a sun screen My husband has acne and has to be careful of sunscreen He loves this one and has had NO breakouts using it We will definitely buy this again,0.198,0.058,0.745,0.9537,Positive

Im a loyal customer of many different Neutrogena products so I figured Id give this sunscreen a try First its obvious that the formula stands up to Neutrogenas claims Its very light doesnt feel oily at all didnt cause any break outs etc It also did a great job of protecting my face from the sun and for that reason I almost wish that there was an SPF 15 option The only thing I didnt like about this product and the reason why it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is how thinrunny it is Makes for a pretty messy application experience,0.123,0.044,0.833,0.848,Positive

I previously purchased CeraVe with SPF which costs 3 times as much for a smaller bottle with half the SPF and I really disliked it It got very grainy when I tried to rub it in I saw this Neutrogena sunscreen on sale and figured it was worth a shot and I really like it It leaves a little bit more shine on my face which I dont love but it feels light rubs in really well and is easy to apply makeup over Ill definitely buy again,0.151,0.086,0.763,0.7145,Positive

Got a couple of these for taking on a trip to Disneyland and it worked great for keeping my family from getting any sunburns Weve had reactions to some cheaper sunscreens on our kids before so I wanted something with high SPF as well as minimal chance of side effects and it went very smoothly It was also pretty easy to put on  not as simple as a spray but Ive just never liked how those felt myself,0.12,0.037,0.843,0.565,Positive

Ive used two tubes of this already and after trying several its still my favorite Its perfect to wear under makeup and its absorbs extremely fast and leaves my skin with absolute no oil residue it may sound weird but it leaves my skin feeling like a put a primer on really soft and evenThe protection is quite high so I recommend it I have sensitive skin and I had have no issues Ive been trying to get on the Mineral Sunscreen train but I simply dont do well with the white cast or the oily feeling those give me afterwards especially after having tried this one,0.139,0.069,0.792,0.8396,Positive
This is my fav sunscreen Ive tried several other facial sunscreens but this is the only one that 1 doesnt break me out and 2 doesnt make me very greasy I have very sensitive eyes and Ive never had a problem with this product unlike other reviewers Mostly because I dont put this anywhere near my eyes You should prob keep ANY sunscreen away from your eyesI use this by mixing 1 part sunscreen and 1 part CeraVe daily moisturizing lotion to make it more spreadable Highly recommend this if youre prone to breakoutshave oily skin but still want sun protection,0.104,0.0,0.896,0.8563,Positive
This sun block works very well medium drying and works very well at protecting your face against the sun rays The only thing is that it leaves skin a little white and also looks oily for about 10 mins Once it sets in it feels perfect,0.162,0.055,0.783,0.6794,Positive

I applied this about an hour before sun exposure again right before going into the sun and 15 minutes later again before going into the water I was not going to let sun burn ruin my vacation  Im fair skinned and burn easily with other sunscreens  I did not burn at all with this However my son did burn luckily he tans quickly and was fine within a day BUT the reason is he applied and then almost immediately went into the water  I strongly recommend this product and recommend applying it in layers periodically before sun exposure,0.155,0.023,0.822,0.8922,Positive

Overall a great product I suffer from acne due to oily skin and I have to be very careful with what products I put on my face After doing some research this product was recommended for acne prone skin Ive been using it for about a month now and its been great and hasnt caused any breakouts Only downfall is that its a bit hard to spread throughout your face Other than that Im very satisfied,0.181,0.059,0.76,0.8775,Positive
Updated review This stuff makes me sweat more and then my eyes sting Stopped using it above the eyesOriginal review I have used the 55 at the pool and for a power walk I was great for pool use spreads extremely well and absorbs fast I also used it for a walk under FL sun and that didnt go well  I swear it made me sweat more than usual and then it started to sting in my eyes Ill find something else for sport and beach use,0.112,0.052,0.836,0.6524,Positive

I am fair skinned and I bike commute in a very hothumid climate so I need to wear sunscreen on a daily basis The problem is that every sunscreen Ive tried on my face makes me break out Enter Clear Face Breakout Free sunscreen Im very happy with this product This is the only sunscreen Ive found that doesnt make my face break outI have forgotten to bring it with me to reapply on occasion and regretted it since I have to use my banana boat inevitably bringing about half a dozen pimples in my T zone Now that Im using this product my skin is clear and protected Recommended if you struggle with sunscreens making you break out,0.151,0.074,0.775,0.8748,Positive
I have combination sensitive skin The kind that if not moisturized it will have a thick layer of oil but still flake underneath This is the first sunscreen Ive found that doesnt break me out In fact it is mattifying and I think helps to reduce my sebaceous filaments It also works beautifully as a primer under makeup although I only wear face makeup on special occasions I apply this product multiple times a day with no excessive drying and no breakouts Would give more than 5 stars if I could,0.148,0.058,0.793,0.8625,Positive
This stuff really works I live in Florida and I have acne prone skin as an adult I was apprehensive about using any sunscreen on my face This works amazingly and it hasnt made me break out at all since I started using it I reapply it often and sweat and my face still stays clear from breakouts and I get full protection from the sun Its incredible I have a friend that uses it too Its really great,0.13,0.0,0.87,0.8805,Positive

I have fair skin and it is a little sensitive  I felt only a slight tingling when first applied  It is definitely a sunscreen  It requires moisturizer to be applied on top along with makeup if you want to wear it  I didnt try it when I went swimming so I dont know if it is waterproof Directions say to reapply after 80 minutes of swimming,0.13,0.0,0.87,0.7269,Positive

Ive used this every day since they finally came out with nonoily sunscreen with an spf over 15 back in the 90s Warning put a barrier around your eyes and dont let it run into your eyes because it will burn I use a thicker lotion on my eyes to keep this from happening I like the spf and its not too greasy and doesnt break me out I use it as a moisturizer under my makeup most days,0.033,0.051,0.916,-0.1027,Negative

This is the only SPF that didnt clog my pores and Ive tried more than dozens If you put it too close to your eyes itll sting pretty bad  I use Blue Lizards for sensitive skin around my eye areas Also if you are a Retin a user you should avoid it when your skin is flaking off  Otherwise your face will feel like its on fire Other than that its an excellent SPF for people with oily or acneprone skin,0.105,0.091,0.804,0.3182,Positive

I bought this sunscreen and felt a burning sensation similar to what others have described and am now getting strange weltlike red marks in in those areas where I normally have little to no blemishes It is definitely not acne I have not experienced chemical burns before so I dont know if thats what it is but other people have offered that explanation and it seems plausible I cannot comment on how fake this product is as I have never tried the supposedly real thing but the small number of negative rumors seem to be true and I suspect the high number of positive reviews might be bot generated,0.112,0.125,0.763,-0.3634,Negative

Preface I have acne prone relatively oily skinThe formulation is really wonderful  The product comes out liquid and as youre working the product into your skin you get the sensation that the product evaporates  it literally feels like you have nothing on I usually use the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer and decided to give it a try  While the Ultra Sheer was good I found it just the tiniest bit too greasy for me so I was really pleased when I tried this one  The SPF 55 was good for the summer and I look forward to trying out this formula in SPF 30 when I finish up this tube,0.141,0.0,0.859,0.9408,Positive

I had to stop using this as it burned my face and caused raised dry spots near my eye  upper cheek Not a fault of the product but if youre sensitive like me then be warned that this may have chemical sunscreen or irritants Didnt have any kind of tamper seal which is weird and possibly not okay The product itself is good though Im a little disappointed that it does not say noncomedogenic on the actual packaging which may mean it is not technically noncomedogenic Ceryl dimethicone is the 3rd ingredientOverall I like the feel but Im weirded out by the lack of a tamper seal does it normally have one and by the fact that it basically just says break out free not noncomedogenic on the packaging,0.111,0.13,0.759,-0.1731,Negative

Just want to start off that I have been using Neutrogena products for over 20years on and off depending on availability  Great products for my combination skin  This is a sunblock lotion with SPF 30 for your face and not a moisturizing lotion with SPF which they also have for the mens line  with heliolpex that seems to be a lot harder to find these days the 30 SPF one  Anyways this is a great sunblock that they have promised to not cause breakouts  So far so good  No breakouts  This leaves a light matte finish on the face  Nothing kabuki theater likeso dont be afraidvery lightnot noticeable at all  Again its a sunblock and not a moisturizer  I think the way its worded on the amazon product description can be slightly misleadingeasily misunderstood,0.128,0.033,0.839,0.9212,Positive

I tried this after seeing tons of recommendations and positive reviews It turns out that was a mistake Only after I had problems did I find the other side of the story  people like me with severe eye and skin irritation who never reacted to other skincare productsMy eyes and eyelids burned for several minutes every time I used this sunscreen I shouldve stopped using it immediately but stupidly I didnt thinking I just needed to get used to it Within a week I had red scaly flaking raised patches on my eyelids My entire face stung like it was chapped or had a chemical burn and my skin began peeling off in dimesized patches I stopped using the sunscreen and my face cleared up and went back to normal within three daysI have almost no contact allergies and had only reacted badly to one cosmetic product prior to this My skin is the opposite of sensitive  its so unlikely that Ill have a problem with anything that I dont even patch test I guess I learned my lesson Now I have a huge bottle of liquid pain and wasted money sitting in my bathroom and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone,0.055,0.189,0.757,-0.9818,Negative

I got this at Walmart but I have to review this product because it is AMAZING I have sensitive skin and it does burn a bit around the eyes when you first put it on but its only slightly uncomfortable and only for around 5 minutes Its so worth it It doesnt cause redness or any visible signs of irritation for memy face actually looks calmer and more even toned after I put it on Other facial sunscreens Ive tried are Cera Ve Facial Moisturizing Lotion AM with SPF 30 and the Cetaphil Mattifiying Moisturizer They were heavy and made my face oily They made my skin feel hot and they burned and stung especially upon second application silly me AND they both gave me a weird rash that made my skin feel rough along with some pimples Not NeutrogenaThis is the real deal No shine guys No shine or greasiness or oiliness Id go out and say that its mattifying It is truly a liquid I turned it upside down and it dripped out of the bottle without me squeezing it Its white but it spreads easily and becomes clear It absorbs very quickly  I cant wait to put it on in the morning and I have to stop myself from putting it on at night My skin feels baby soft after I smooth it on my face Its silky Its honestly probably the silicones but I dont care Lets just stop and talk about how great my face looks after wearing this everyday for two weeks I have combination skin that is usually quite dry in some areas but also oily in the T zone with some weird bumps blackheads and the occasional pimple This sunscreen has made my face permanently super soft and it cleared up the bumps I had on my skin which I think were keratosis pilaris and which I have struggled with for a long time I had redness that also disappearedthis sunscreen seems to have a brightening effect Guys I had some fine lines starting  and theyre gone too Reading the ingredients I dont really see how its giving me all these benefits but it is Im moisturized not flaky and I even have fewer blackheads Its craziness If youre usually not satisfied with how matte your sunscreens are or if youre sensitive to most chemical facial sunscreens you should try this out Its a winner for me When it runs out Im buying another bottle I have only one complaint that I dont think its actually waterproof I swim and it runs into my eyesit does sting But its still the greatest nonshiny facial sunscreen that you can actually wear without having to cover up with makeup,0.13,0.083,0.787,0.9823,Positive
I tried this since it is new and claims to be matte  For the past three years I have been very loyal to the Ultra Sheer Liquid SPF 70 formula US which I love bc I think it really disappears into the skin and leaves no shine on the surface perfect under makeup too  You should see my review of the Ultra Sheer  I should be a freaking spokes person I think its so great  Having said that I find Clear Face CF to be JUST AS GOOD  I will write a breakdown of the products in an easytoread form Liquid light texture BOTH feel liquid light on the skin and disappear completely leaving no shiny residue  Both are easy to wear under makeup however I find the CF rollsup into those pesky balls when you rub it in a lot  This doesnt happen to me every time so Im thinking it may be when I layer too many serums and lotions underneath  When I use CF on its own this doesnt happen  So it may be the layering or the serums themselves that are the problem  This has never been a problem with US  Note CF feels a tad thicker in the hand but disappears just as finely as the US liquid Finish BOTH are completely matte  I wear sunscreen every day like a good girl  and I wear both under makeup and alone with ZERO grease problems  I have combination skin but I think all skin types would like this next to nothing look Reactions I dont have very sensitive skin but it does easily dryout if I use acne products on a pimple I get every now and then  Both CF and US are chemical sunscreens  That doesnt bother me but I know some people cant tolerate that  If thats an issue for you try the PureFree versions very good physical sunscreens but they leave a slight white cast Price These are about the same price but the CF is 3 oz while the US is 14 ozTo be honest Im not sure why they launched CF when it is a dupe albeit more affordable version of US  I think that with the new FDA regulations that came out eg cant claim to be more than 50 SPF cant be called sunblock etc Neutrogena might be phasing out the US in favor the new CF  The ingredients lists are very similar with the major ingredients being nearly identical  Its a bit confusing to me from a consumermarketing perspective  Hope this is useful,0.125,0.073,0.802,0.9801,Positive

First Amazon review ever I think I didnt buy this on Amazon but now that Ive tried it and know its sold here I will I have VERY VERY VERY VERY oily skin The kind of skin that you powder excessively at 7 AM and is completely oily by 9 AM Nothing has ever worked at controlling the oil and I doubted anything ever would I bought this just because I thought it wouldnt exacerbate the oiliness of my skin Lo and behold it actually mattifies my skin more than any product ever has I dont need to powder again until about noon five hours is a lot for someone with skin as oily as mine Granted I am quite shiny by then but not as shiny as I am without anything on my skin I do really enjoy it its only been a couple of weeks but Ill keep using it and update this if anything changes Oh my skin is prone to acne as well but Ive noticed no new breakouts while using this product,0.072,0.052,0.876,0.3484,Positive
To be honest I didnt buy it here I bought it at WalMartI have really sensitive combination skin with acne Most things make me break out I bought a sunblock moisturizer from Aveeno but it was making me break out I researched the best brand of sunblocks and Neutrogena was rated first by most pharmacistsIt does not feel like most sunblock all thick and greasy and gross This feels very thin and creamy and feels like it dissolves and blends in very fast and almost effortlessly So far my skin has not had any extra breakouts This lotion makes my skin feel very soft and smooth Ive never had a sunblock like it I really enjoy it I would give it 5 stars but it does irritate my eyes sometimes but I think every sunblock will do thatI would definitely buy it again,0.104,0.102,0.794,0.3388,Positive
Matte finish on my face when spread disappears and gets absorbed by my skin easily after a minute I like that the consistency is not too thick nor is it too thin It is not harmful and is not irritating to my skin I am usually sensitive to products and I usually feel the burning sensation from others but this did not do that to me If anything it would probably burn if there are openings on your skin Also I like that it is noncomedogenic which means it does not clog the poresIf there is one thing that I would like for this product to improve on is its little smell IT DOES NOT SMELL A LOT but it does smell Actually I was first amazed when I first opened it and smelled the opening because I thought that I wasnt smelling anythinghowever when I smeared it on my face I started smelling just a little sunscreen smelling cream Dont get me wrong it does not smell as bad as the other products but this one still has the smell I just want to get it out there so people wont expect that this has zero smell If I would rate the smell from 1 to 10 10 being too strong of a smell Id say this is at 2 So yeah not bothering at allThis product is a chemical sunscreen and if you are a follower of skincare you know that there are two types of sunscreens chemical and physical This Neutrogena sunscreen is chemical and therefore needs to go before your moisturizer It needs to touch the skin to activate Physical sunscreens are the ones that could go ON TOP of your moisturizer Both have their pros and cons and I just feel it needs to be mentioned that this one is a chemical sunscree and by as science dictates it needs to go on your skin as the first layer after cleansingwashing of course before your other facial productsGo ahead and try this I do recommend thisPSThank you,0.131,0.005,0.864,0.9918,Positive

Ive been using this product for about two years now I had stopped using sunscreen on my face because of my breakouts But since using this product I feel more confident on using it daily I wear it under makeup when I run and on my handsIts on the dry side so I use it with my normal moisturizer and it works just fine The only thing that I dont like is the smell it definitely has a chemical smell to itThis is great product for the price Its something I will always have in my makeup bag,0.155,0.039,0.806,0.9328,Positive
So far Ive only used this product onceThe feel is nice not too oily not too dry you basically dont really feel it which is important as Ive experience a lot of other sticky and oily feels with sunblock The smell is not bad its nothing fancy like citrus or strawberry etc It just smells like sunblock but the smell is not overpowering either it disappears after a little bit I would recommend,0.105,0.08,0.815,0.219,Positive

I had the same lotion but with SPF 110Pros non greasy doesnt cause acne doesnt smell like sunscreen acts as a primer under my makeupCons really thick burns eyes if contact occurs melts off with sweat water not for exerciseI thoght this lotion was perfect until I took a break from jogging yesterday to use the restroom and looked in the mirror to see I was sweating white water off of my face This conserns me because not only did I loose the sun protection but I looked like a weirdo in front of these cute guys jogging shirtless sigh life is so unfair,0.11,0.126,0.764,-0.4355,Negative
I love this sunscreen Im very fair toned and get the occasional breakout like those big one or two pimples at a time that take up a good majority of your cheek or nose kind of breakouts the big honkers if you will I slather a pretty moderate amount of this on my face after I cleanse and moisturize and kind of pat it in real good It takes away the shine of my moisturizer and gives me a matte finish that makes you ready to go even without foundation I dont have the oiliest of skin mind you I love that it has such a high SPF it keeps sunburns at bay when Im out for a long bike ride or a walk with the dog The first day I used this sunscreen I put this on my face shoulders neck and back and went for a bike ride and the got a mild burn on my arms of course the one place I didnt put it I considered it a good test for functionality of the product So you dont always have to use it on your face it is a sunscreen so you can put it where ever but i suppose if youre prone to back acne or chest acne this would probably be a good suite for you to use in those areas as well This product has never broke me out even when you start to sweat I will be repurchasing this product for sure,0.126,0.0,0.874,0.9774,Positive

Am early 50s  Skin is drying out and wrinkling due to age but also has breakouts how lame is that  Have tried many sunscreens for my face and neck and even end up using kids heavygreasy SPF30 when I have nothing else  BUT  I stumbled across Neutrogena Clear Face SPF 30 sunblock and now Ill use nothing else for my face and neck  The lotion is lightweight and spreads easily and is not greasy oily or shiny  Dries into my skin quickly  Has the standard sunscreen smell which they probably could do better on which is why it got only 4stars  but is not bad  Package is small for my purse and car glove box  Cap lid closes tightsly no sunscreen explosions  And after months of use NO BREAKOUTS  Love this product,0.129,0.091,0.781,0.7799,Positive
I bought this after reading good reviews on amazon It doesnt leave those nasty looking white stuff on your face once you apply it on or makes your face looking greasy afterwards Its like a light moisturizer This also didnt break out my sensitive face like it claimed to be but the only downside is that stings my face a bit right after I put in on my face,0.14,0.036,0.825,0.5165,Positive

LOVE this sunscreen I dont know if this has any scientific basis but it seems to me that I stay lighter with this sunscreen on under the glare of the sun rather than tan if i dont wear it Its just a personal preference because my facial skin goes a weird orangey shade in the summer otherwise that Im not fond of Additionally like the name suggests NO BREAKOUTS and no heavy or greasy feel I wear it under my makeup as a primer because of how moisturizing it is,0.065,0.125,0.81,-0.685,Negative

Im really impressed with this product It actually lived up to my expectations I can apply Clear Face SPF 30 fairly liberally and it still dries to a matte nongreasy nonsticky finish I can easily apply mineral powder over it without the makeup grabbing Just be sure to wait about 15 minutes for the product to dry Clear Face has hardly any smell And although Im prone to clogged pores Im in my mid 40s my complexion hasnt worsened since Ive started using this sunscreen which is amazing I usually cant put any creams or lotions on my face without seeing an increase in bumpiness I highly recommend this and will buy it again Note I always have a problem with sunscreens running into my eyes I find that by skipping my temples I dont really have that problem anymore You can use powder with SPF on that area instead,0.14,0.046,0.814,0.9316,Positive

I have combination caucasian skin and since this sunscreen uses chemical rather than physical blockers it goes on my skin every single morning as the very first product before my primer and makeup  For most of the year its moisturizing enough to wear in place of a regular face lotion though I still use a high quality night cream  It feels light and nongreasy as long as you make sure to give it a few minutes to absorb before applying other products This costs several times less the designer sunscreens that youd get at a department store beauty counter or dedicated cosmetics store like Sephora  The only small drawback is that if Im working up a SERIOUS sweat outside during the summer it can sting my eyes just a tiny bit though that will happen with almost any product,0.083,0.015,0.902,0.8614,Positive
My biggest worry with sunscreen for the face is the white residue it can leave This sunscreen doesnt leave anything once rubbed in Is great protection especially for everyday wear Would definitely recommend,0.224,0.127,0.649,0.7184,Positive
Im currently using a mix of actives to fight my acne benzoyl peroxide Retina so I was looking for something that wouldnt make me break out too obviously and a lower SPF for indoor quarantine use but this stuff is not good for sensitive skin It burned slightly when I put it on and leaves skin feeling dry even with using a moisturizer first If youre currently using actives to fight another skin issue and need something super gentle this is not a good bet,0.156,0.134,0.71,0.4822,Positive
This is the only facial sunscreen Ive ever used that doesnt cause breakouts It also makes the skin matte which lasts all day and reduces the shine on oily skin However this product is so incredibly drying that I cant really even use it as a daily sunscreen which is what I bought it for in the first place I guess it does sort of depend on your skin type but I have extremely oily acneprone skin and this made my skin visibly dry and scaly within a week Its a good sunscreen but be wary of how drying it can be,0.039,0.0,0.961,0.5927,Positive
Edit 101519  Im taking two stars off because this pills If I touch my face at all during the day I am a flakey mess I really like it for the first couple of hours until it dries down Oh well I usually give my failed sunscreens away to my lighter friendsI am African American and I have struggled to find a good drugstore SPF for my face that doesnt pill or leave a white cast This is it Its a chemical sunscreen so I think that has something to do with it I will definitely be repurchasing,0.118,0.083,0.799,0.3487,Positive
I did not buy this at Amazon but I love it so much I had to write a review and my recommendations First  I have had very oilyacneprone skin all my life My skin is also very fair and sensitive and I live in South Florida Nonchemical sunscreens are too thick and make me break out Most chemical sunscreens are too oily AND they burn my sensitive skin especially at high SPFs I find that with care using a very mild cleanser this product protects my skin from the sun while making it matte and oilfree for hours and hours without causing any breakouts Its great under foundation and I dont have to blot or touchup all day while a lot of other primers and sunscreens even socalled matte ones cause a major greaseattack I love to experiment with new products but I am sold on this one The appearance on your skin is natural smooth and looking a justwashed matteTo recap  is your skin oily yet sensitive BUY THIS IN SPF 30 Wear it every day Even if you have darker skin or live in a lessthantropical climate Skin cancer is no fun I have had small precancers removed  with either freezing it or cauterizing Yes it hurts as much as it sounds The freezing left me with white scars and the cauterizing with pink marks which lasted for months Skin cancer hurts skin cancer is ugly and skin cancer kills Dont be a victim,0.144,0.161,0.696,-0.8014,Negative

This sunscreen is the only one Ive found that has not made me break out or irritated my skin even though I have tried more expensive sunscreens by LaRoche Posay and Andalou Naturals It is light enough to use with oily skin and has a slight mattifying effect I have medium brown skin and although it does cast a white tint on my face on initial application I feel that it sinks in sufficiently after half an hour so that its not longer noticeable It is the only physical nontinted sunscreen that does not cast a longlasting white tint on my face,0.0,0.031,0.969,-0.4588,Negative

Best sunscreen I have found for my face As other say it is light disappears on the face and feels matte I have acne so I use a salicyclic treatment and a treatment to reduce scarring red marks both say that sunscreen is necessary because they make your skin more sensitive to the sun So I love this sunscreen because as far as I can tell it hasnt provoked further acneIt can sting a little and I thought it might be due to small abrasions on my skin from roughhandling So I became more gentle when I washed and I used tissues to dry After that I felt less of a stingMy dermatologist acne brochure says Excessive washig and scrubbing will not prevent or treat acne Too much scrubbing can irritate your skin and make acne worse,0.1,0.083,0.817,0.6521,Positive

I really like the fact that this is a sunblock designed for acne prone skinHOWEVER I find that it doesnt really mattify skin or keep oil at bay which are two major things for me Usually after I apply it my skin looks pretty shiny and feels a little stickyish This sunscreen is more on the runnyish side and does have a stronger sunscreen scent when it first goes on but it dissipates fairly quickly I dont consider myself to be someone who has sensitive skin but this sometimes stings my face a bit when I apply it Im not quite sure why this is but it could be that I exfoliated too much or my skin is on the drier side in some areas This sunblock does make good on its promise not to break you out and it does have a light feel for a sunscreen I usually wait ten minutes before I apply any makeup just to make sure its fully absorbed It doesnt pill up when I accidentally rub or itch my face which is also nice I probably wont repurchase this I bought this as a cheaper alternative to the Elta MD sunscreen but Im thinking I should have just shelled out the ten extra bucks for the better product,0.094,0.04,0.866,0.8888,Positive

This caused a rash on my cheeks after one day of use I am not acne prone and have never had an allergic reaction to a sunscreen After one day of use my cheeks started to burn and I developed scaly itchy bumps 24 hours later My friends who also used it had similar reactions along with face swelling and severe sneezing I highly recommend testing this on a patch of your skin before using in the sun I do not have sensitive skin so this reaction was extremely out of the ordinary,0.082,0.078,0.841,0.0979,Positive

Ive been using Neutrogena Face Sunblock on my face for years but I always break out from it I thought I would give the clear face product a try OMG it burns like crazy I like the actual product It goes on thin and clean and doesnt create a build up like the regular Neutrogena does but I cant get over the initial burning it does to my face I have very sensitive skin so I thought maybe that was why I made my husband try it who doesnt have sensitive skin at all He was screaming It honestly burns your face so bad Its like putting alcohol on an open cut I wasted my money on this product and Neutrogena let me down,0.164,0.15,0.686,0.2598,Positive

So I actually bought this at Walmart rather than amazon but I wanted to leave a review to warn you guys of possible contact dermatitis From looking at the ingredients I think that either the cinnamon or cedrus atlantica bark extract is to blame Both are basically astringents but can also be sensitizing to the skin and Im pretty sure were the cause of the rash that appeared around my eyes the next morning after using it This may not happen to everyone but just beware that it can cause an allergic reaction,0.084,0.121,0.795,-0.4118,Negative

I was so hopefully about this product I have been looking for AGES to find a sunscreen that doesnt make you break out worse after using it Unfortunately I must be allergic to something in this because this caused me to have a horrible itchy bumpy rash all over my face chin neck and ears where I used it The itchiness is driving me CRAZY My skin didnt get burned while using this but I caution others to try it out on a small patch of skin first for a day or two before using as your normal sun screen Trust me a few more pimples from your normal sunscreen while testing this product somewhere else is MUCH better than the torture that is this rash all over your face for days,0.072,0.154,0.773,-0.8257,Negative
After loving the Ultra Sheer version of this product for my arms neck back etc I thought Id give the Clear Face version of this a try Much to my dismay my husband and I both felt a lot of strong stinging sensation on our faces We had no obvious face irritation he hadnt just shaved and I hadnt washedexfoliated my face that day and were shocked at how much discomfort this sunscreen caused We had to reapply a couple of times since we were at a long baseball game and we experienced the same stinging sensation every time My husband does admittedly have sensitive skin but mine has never had any problems Im not sure what ingredient could be causing the irritation especially since I have never had trouble with Neutrogena products before I will be sticking to the regular Ultra Sheer for my body and look for something gentler for my face,0.093,0.099,0.808,0.0467,Neutral

Every time I use this sunscreen I am usually at the pool I run it on my face and it works great But then after I get out of the pool to reapply after about 2 hours it burns VERY bad I have read many articles on how Neutrogena sunscreens have lots of chemicals and toxins in them and the pool I go to is chlorine I am just assuming that after having the chlorine on your face and putting this sunblock on somehow the sunscreen reacts with the chlorine in the water and burns REALLY bad for about 3045 minutes My 2 sisters and 1 friend have used this and complained about how it burns them too so I dont think the problem is my skin I have used this sunblock for about 2 months and threw it out 2 days ago I hope this review is helpful to you ,0.107,0.1,0.793,-0.2122,Negative
So I bought this whole at the beach because I have fairly sensitive skin and I had gotten a slight burn the day before from just using my normal sunscreen After applying it I then got to experience a burning sensation that was absolutely horrid I would have preferred no sun screen and a sun burn over this feeling It wasnt greasy as it claimed but it left my face feeling like I had poured alcohol over a fresh wound for several hours I will never use or buy this product again,0.107,0.045,0.848,0.6655,Positive

I like this sunscreen for my oily  combination skin especially during the warmer months It goes on easily and seems to effectively protect my very fair skin from the sun My only wish is that it was actually clear coming out of the bottle rather than white That being said it doesnt leave a white cast on my skin as so many sunscreens do It seems to moisturize without being greasy It hasnt caused acne breakouts at all,0.246,0.0,0.754,0.9578,Positive

Its nice to have a sunscreen specific use for your face It goes on really easy and it doesnt take ten minutes to rub in like the cheap stuff A little bit goes a long way It is not greasy at all and doesnt clog my pores and doesnt cause me to break out like so many other sunscreens do I will keep buying I havent used it while running or doing outdoor activities that cause me to sweat So in terms of sweat proof I cant say But as for general purposes outdoors I love it,0.135,0.0,0.865,0.9061,Positive
So far the best sunscreen for face I have tried  Goes on smoothly over other moisturizers and serums without pilling  Protects against sunburn and doesnt feel greasy after it is applied  I also use it to protect my tattoos on my arms and I like that it actually is sheer and doesnt cast a weird white residue sparkle or glow on them  I dont think it is very moisturizing by itself but it pairs nicely over other lotions  A little stingy if it sweats into your eyes but not any more so than any other sunscreen would,0.132,0.044,0.824,0.7814,Positive

I used it yesterday and very shortly after applying my face started to burn and tingle I have pretty sensitive skin but this have never happened to me before I will give it one more shot but a bit scared now I like that it has high SPF and does not leave white residue so hopefully I will not react to it any more fingers crossed I have melasma on my face so I need something that works  well and was so hopeful about this product,0.209,0.041,0.75,0.943,Positive

This product claims to be breakout free but unfortunately thats just not true This past year I had been experimenting with different products and FINALLY found a skincare routine that resulted in clear glowing skin I had been using the same routine for months and decided to try this sunscreen since it was cheaper than the one I was currently usingWhen I first applied it I was honestly impressed by the lack of white cast which is so common in high SPF sunscreens Although that feeling soon vanished as my face began to burn and itch like crazy I should have washed it off then and there but I really wanted to like this product so I decided to keep it on for the rest of the day The next day my already dry skin was very irritated My cheeks were red and I started seeing little bumps in places Since I hadnt changed anything else in my skincare routine it had to be a result of using the sunscreen Maybe this sunscreen just doesnt work for dry skin Overall I would not recommend,0.11,0.097,0.793,0.4014,Positive

This is a great sunscreen Its very lightweight and gives my face a nice gloss without looking too oily The only things I dont like are that it sometimes leaves white residue when applied over a moisturizer It may just be because this sunscreen and my moisturizer dont mix too well and gives my face a grayish tint Im naturally tan with a yellow undertone Ill be trying other sunscreens in the future but for now I wouldnt mind going through my whole bottle,0.055,0.06,0.885,0.1501,Positive

I got mixed and akne prone skinI got this product specifically for the no akne parti got pimples not a lot but more than beforewith othersAlso the smell was really bad and the cream was heavy and oilyI looked like I bathed my face in oil or like my brother said he could see himself on my forehead,0.101,0.106,0.793,-0.0745,Negative
I have the worst face skin Its oily red full of filaments and small pimples As soon as the sun hits my face I turn into a crab a painful one Im also a guy if thats relevantThis cream has been better for me than any other cream in my 20 years of life so far It doesnt clog any pores its easy too remove if your want to with water and a bit of soap its doesnt smell and it has NO ALCOHOL so it doesnt dry your skinI live in Europe and this is the second batch I buy of itAnd no even though you shouldnt use sun screen thats older than some months I can guarantee that after more than one year it still is very effective at blocking the sun My face can feel a huge difference at the end of the day compared to not using any cream Im pretty sure it also has some kind of moisturizing effect because for a few hours after I apply it if I stay kiiinda protected from the sun my face feels much lighter and radiant,0.13,0.074,0.796,0.8518,Positive
Wanted a facial sunscreen for a summer holiday that would help with my problem skin I have spot prone skin and the standard beach break combination of sun lotion and sweat makes me break out terribly so that every time i come back from holiday i look worse than when I went Ordered this and was surprised at how quickly it came given that it was shipped from the US Was pretty pleased with this Had a small breakout but nowhere near what I usually get from when I have tried both a standard suncream and also spent a lot of money on a suncream from a very reputable skincaremakeup company This may have also been because i sometimes mixed it with my body sun lotion so it was definitely the best option Ive tried so far Once applied it stayed matte on my generally oily face which i was impressed at No thick oily residue that lasts for ages and makes skin shiny For this reason I actually was able to test this out under makeup before my holiday without a problem at all as it is more matte than many daily moisturizers Ive had Rubbed in well Occasionally after repeated application it had a quite a tingly feeling but i would liken this to the feeling you get applying a spot cream My only concern is that as a US product there is no indication of UVA and UVB ratings that UK products give you hence why I mixed it occasionally with my body suncream Even so I would definitely recommend this and will buy again particularly as it sits so well under makeup that i will happily use it all year round,0.167,0.051,0.782,0.9875,Positive
Packaging came nicely packaged and not faulty in any way The tube has a matte feel which is convenient when having sunscreen covered fingers as it prevents it from slipping out of your handsIngredients compared to other sunscreens I found no major harmful ingredients in this product and a handful of benefits aside to the obvious uv protection You can use an online cosmetic analyser to see more info on thisHowever this sunscreen does leave a white cast behind To counter this I can kind of blend it in if I dont use too much  but then again Im white so if you are someone with dark black or brown skin you may want to avoid this and look towards a sunscreen in a gel form or liquid spray,0.062,0.044,0.894,0.0852,Positive
Ive probably tried about 20 different sunscreens in the past two years Chemical physical combo highend drugstore asian european american  you name it Ive probably tried it Every single one broke me out somehow Ive tried to figure out what ingredient breaks me out but with no success I bought this with a pinch of salt I found it strange they can almost guarantee it wont break you out Ive tried the ultra sheer dry touch which didnt break me out but stung so badly around my eyes This one doesnt contain as much fragrance and doesnt sting at all This one doesnt break me out at all Im not sure how they do it but it just feels like moisturiser It will be a sad day when they stop producing this as its the only sunscreen Ill use from now on Its slightly shiny but I just apply a matte powder on top and Im ready to go about my day Absolutely exceptional Nuetrogena It also has HELIOPLEX technology meaning it wont degrade in the sun like other chemical sunscreens would needing to be reapplied every two hours,0.103,0.118,0.779,-0.5123,Negative
I used to like it until warmer weather arrived The warmer days meant the product moved around the face getting into eyes which did not happen during colder months when it stayed put It stung my eyes so bad especially at the end of the day as if I was cutting onions literally watering eyes And the stinging stayed long after washing vigorously with makeup removerAlso having done a bit of research into chemical sunscreen I discovered that it was contributing to my dermatitis Now using 100 percent mineral based sunscreen ONLY,0.087,0.062,0.851,0.105,Positive
Seems to work well in protecting against sun damage and preventing skin outbreaks Does feel light and thin but very oily at the same time and leaves a noticeable white cast that requires a lot of work to rub in Not sure if it would be suitable for darker skin tones since I am paler but the white cast could be an issue if youre not pale,0.023,0.083,0.894,-0.4666,Negative
I bought this for a specific reason I needed a suncream that would go in hand luggage and it must not cause heat rash Up until now the only one I could find that didnt bring me out it horrendous rash was Clinique spray too big for hand luggage and rather pricey Im happy to report that its so far so good with thisIf you have to use oil free suncream youll be used to having to reapply regularly particularly around where clothing or bag straps might rub away from skin and its no different with this but when I applied properly I didnt burn and most importantly no heat rash This is such a big deal for me Im giving this 5 stars for this fact alone If youre lucky enough to be able to use oil based suncreams then I expect you will find this substandard because of how easily it rubs off but if you get heat rash from oil based creams then I highly recommend trying this,0.198,0.049,0.753,0.9775,Positive
Ive really struggled to find a face sunscreen that didnt clog my pores or make my face go really oily and so far this has not disappointed Its really lightweight soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft but not oily or greasy The only thing Im struggling with is the amount to put on  it spreads really easily and when Ive put too much on Ive noticed that I get it forming into little white strands that I can just brush off but if I dont they stick to my skin,0.068,0.058,0.874,0.0052,Neutral

I will get straight to the pointItem arrived dirty I mean actually dirty half of the tube see photo was covered in something that looked and felt like mud This was not a transportation issue as the delivery box was clear inside On top of this the product was open and it was unclear whether someone had used it or did who knows what to it For a skin care product this doesnt inspire the minimum level of confidence or trust How is one supposed to put this on their face after this especially considering the nature of the productVery disappointed come on guys,0.154,0.115,0.73,0.5722,Positive
I have VERY sensitive skin and would never normally dream of using normal sun lotion on my face However after reading the reviews I thought I could trust this not to cause me to break out in a reactionWell that was justified as Ive had no adverse reactions at all And its a cooling easytouse lotion that sinks right in leaves no reside and is fine underneath makeup or other mousterisersHowever despite applying it every 2 hours as stated whilst its stopped me from burning it hasnt stopped the melasma that I get at this time of year the blotchy brown skin that is worsened by sun exposureSo its fine for normal use but as a complete sun block I dont think it works,0.054,0.12,0.825,-0.7367,Negative
It doesnt leave any whitecast but I thought it would be great for my oily skin as its oil free but it does make my face greasy,0.327,0.0,0.673,0.9037,Positive
It isnt available from the UK only USA  I purchased this product and the delivery timescale was only 2 weeks although it advertises it could be longer  There were no customs charges either for receipt of international goods  Its a white fluid but blends in clear and smooth with no caking  Brillant sunscreen and I would definitely buy this again  I have acne prone skin so I use it on my face neck and chestI do prefer aromatherapy or organic products but the facial sunscreens for acne prone skin are fairly relatively expensive 40 for 50mlPreviously I used La Roche Posay Anthelio AC antishine matte fluild 50ml facial sunscreen 16 but I found it very time consuming applying it You had to be careful how much you apply  I found it made my face whiter once applied and it caked around drier or hairier areas on my face such as upper lip eye brows and hairline  So I wouldnt recommend this product and I wouldnt use it again myself,0.052,0.053,0.894,0.2065,Positive
This is a great sunscreen if you dont have sensitive skin It blends really well into the skin and sits lovely under makeup However I had to wash this off after only a short time because it stung like crazy I assumed that being Neutrogena it woud be good for all skin types but sadly not  I guess  it is because it is a chemical suncreen rather than mineral based Hence why it blends so easily but reacts with sensitive skin,0.167,0.062,0.771,0.7976,Positive
I thought I had found the perfect facial sunscreen Its non greasy doesnt bring me out in spots looks and feels matt sits well under makeup and doesnt cost the earth However to my great dissapointment I have found it makes my eyes water and sting so badly and persistently I dont put it on my eye lids but around the eye and forehead but somehow maybe sweat It always migrates to my eyes and its very uncomfortable So dissapointed because I thought this was the one,0.072,0.071,0.858,-0.2228,Negative
Was sceptical at first because I have oily combination skin in and easily break out I bought this based on online information not personal recommendation so wasnt holding my breath on on its ability to be compatible with my skin I have been using this for a week no breakoutsdont use primer anymore because this mattifies my skin for over 8 hours absolutely brilliant product cant recommend it enough for Asian oily combination skin prone to breakouts and temperamental Will definitely be buying this product again it is so worth the price,0.141,0.065,0.794,0.8163,Positive

It absorbs really nicely and seems to work pretty well at the beginning especially since I have acne prone skin and break out very easily until after a while Ive noticed that touching the skin seems to make the suncream rub off in small pieces on certain areas of my face which can be really irritating as you can see small white bits on your face and have to try and dust it off without causing more cream to rub off,0.148,0.037,0.815,0.8399,Positive

GOT ACNE use this I use this spring through autumn Love it Not sticky and smells fresh Wish it didnt have a scent but it doesnt irritate or block your pores Highly recommended to me by my Derm Only problem it makes the skin look a little dewy at the end of the day which I love but if you hate having oily looking skin I would look elsewhere,0.245,0.102,0.653,0.8764,Positive
Not sure whether it works with acne prone skin as I still have milia type spots after three months of use I have continued to use it as I use Differin gel every night After cleaning toning and moisturising I wait 5 minutes and then use sunscreen Initially it does burn for a few minutes causing some redness but then stops Dont think I will repurchase as my skin feels greasy afterwards,0.0,0.051,0.949,-0.3359,Negative

Ive had loads of disagreements with face SPFs and tried so many others but this one is definitely my favourite It blends into the skin nice and quick so your face doesnt look oily or greasy So nice to apply as well its such a lovely product and hasnt irritated my sensitive skin Used it every single day and near the end of my bottle so looking to repurchase,0.259,0.022,0.718,0.9687,Positive

Im really pleased with this product I really struggle to find sunscreens and moisturisers that dont make my skin really oily but Ive been using this for about a week and my skin has been far more matte than usual This may mean its not ideal for people with dry skin but I would thoroughly recommend it for anyone with combinationoily skin,0.087,0.082,0.83,0.0837,Positive

Love Neutrogena products and again this one didnt disappoint It is never very easy to get some of there products and a lot seem to get discontinued but I hope they keep supplying this Doesnt break me out ever though I have very oily skin and doesnt feel heavy Great for extra protection in summer and I use the 30 rest of the year,0.117,0.09,0.793,0.2087,Positive
I started using this product recently Honestly I am disappointed in this productOn the first use everything was fine but over the course of a few days I began to feel a stinging sensation when applied The stinging developed into a burning sensation and eventually I had to stop using the product all together After I stopped using the product the redness on my face went down and my acne reduced Furthermore I found that I had small chemical burns confirmed by my GP dotted around my face that werent present before using this product I was sceptical if this was even the true account for Neutrogena and I believe now that it isnt I also believe that the product was counterfeitI implore you do not buy this product,0.056,0.079,0.864,-0.4404,Negative

I had high hopes for this as it is called clear face and announces twice on the front that it will not cause breakouts  However it did  Really bad acne from which I am still recovering two weeks later after a thin application removed after a few hours when I could get to a tap  I could feel the spots starting  As far as I am aware it protected me from the sun but it certainly did NOT do what it said on the tube,0.105,0.029,0.866,0.6546,Positive

Am having to revise my previous review Absolutely loved this sunscreen previously was using spf 55 but when ran out bought this one to last through spring Took me a while to realise that what was happening with my skin was caused by this sunscreen My usually greasy combo skin became inflamed red and began flaking off in very embarrassing noticeable large scaly patchesit literally looked and felt like I had been burnt Be warned this may be a fake product Also no seal on the tube which I should have taken need of in the first place God knows what I had been using on my face i dread to think,0.067,0.163,0.77,-0.9192,Negative

I use the product as directed and without fail the product pills and leaves white residue all over my face It looks like someones had at me with a dry exfoliating brush to be honest I cant say anything for the UVAB protection but if it cant properly absorb into your face I dont see how this product could be any effective in that regard,0.149,0.0,0.851,0.8391,Positive

This is a very good sunscreen but I am not fond of the way it goes on It is quite dry once on your face and there is pulling of the skin to get it to spread  I like neutrogena products but I think I will find one not labeled dry It needs to be easier to spread,0.148,0.051,0.801,0.7129,Positive
Im a big fan of the Neutrogena brand and I am also a daily sunscreen user I tried the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc dry touch sunscreen and it was much more pleasant to use than other mineral sunscreens that I have tried I would have liked it to rub in a bit easier and I wish the scent was a bit more subtle,0.228,0.0,0.772,0.9216,Positive
Does a very good job of sun protection in and out of the water Its great for small areas such as the nose or cheeks that are susceptible to burning However because its a zinc product I found it very difficult to apply a light coat evenly over a large area I found it much like spreading ointment on a babys bottom I wouldnt have a problem pasting this on a child but as an adult I want the sunscreen to be invisible,0.122,0.025,0.853,0.6787,Positive
It has a great sunscreen protection and goes on smooth I just didnt like that it made my face so white instead of blending in with my natural color,0.202,0.065,0.734,0.6694,Positive
Tried this because zinc based sunscreen is better for the ocean reef health and gentler on skin Im a die hard Neutrogena sheer sunscreen user of the other variety as I cant stand the feel of sunscreen and the sheer is the best for that The new sheer zinc is the best of zinc but still leaves white steaks on your skin and feels much stickier than the nonzinc version It is however FAR superior to the feel of other zinc products So if you want zinc use this If you dont care about zinc use the nonzinc Neutrogena sheer product,0.137,0.063,0.8,0.8102,Positive
This sunscreen does give good protection from the sun However I dislike the scent and the fact that it feels very thick and greasy and takes awhile to sink into your skin,0.084,0.075,0.841,0.0772,Positive

While I love the protection that the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry Touch provides I hate the feeling it leaves on my skin It is hard to describe the feeling but it makes me feel like I have a coat of grime in me and it takes washing myself with exfoliating cleansers three times before I can get the residue off of my skin Not only does the feeling feel grimy but the zinc opaque white film transfers to EVERYTHING This sunscreen never dries down it just spreads and spreads I was sent this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review,0.165,0.091,0.745,0.8176,Positive
I like that Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry Touch SPF 50 is free of fragrance chemicals parabens etc   however I did not find it all that easy to applyit is very thick and was not the easiest to rub in  After I applied it I had to go wash my hand because they were covered in it  I like the benefits of this sunscreen but not the application of it,0.164,0.024,0.812,0.7804,Positive

has a stinky smell otherwise its good doesnt drip into my eyes working outside in heat when I sweat,0.142,0.123,0.735,0.1027,Positive
It works really well but it has a clay like consistency that makes it really hard to rub into the skin and spread around your body which can sometimes make it easy to miss a spot It usually leaves a white cast which I dont really mind but I wouldnt consider it sheer at all All in all it works well but the consistency is a turn off for me so Ill use what I have and try other mineral sunscreens,0.135,0.101,0.764,0.4628,Positive
I did a patch test with this on my arm and it was ok And then after 23 days I applied it to my face and neck and went out and drove for maybe 15 mins Next day my face and neck was red I guess I am allergic to it when it reacts with sunlight I am also allergic to the Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen SPF 110 and Clear Face Liquid Lotion Sunscreen SPF 55 But since this one says it mineral based and all the positive reviews i thought this would work for me   I have used Ultra Sheer DryTouch Water Resistant SPF 55 for around 6 years and I am not allergic to it but I started getting more acne so wanted to tryout something else Not sure what ingredient I am allergic to Also this sunscreen is not easy to apply,0.056,0.097,0.848,-0.6189,Negative

I have used Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch SPF 100 for several years with excellent results When I saw one for sensitive skin I assumed that it would be better I applied it in the morning and washed it off that night with no problem When I woke up the next morning I had a horrible rash like a severe sunburn My face was swollen and very hot to the touch Its been 4 days now and finally back to normal I did notify the company and gave them my info I received a coupon for purchase that expires in a month I would suggest that you test this product on a small area before putting it all over your face like I did,0.093,0.11,0.796,-0.2732,Negative
My skin does not like chemical sun screens so I was looking for a mineral sunscreen This product is described as sheer and dry touch so sounded like a good choice for sun protection at high altitude Well it is a thick white cream that doesnt absorb well It feels goopy and damp on my skin and definitely leaves a white cast it reminds me of the white zinc that lifeguards used to wear on their noses I honestly cannot believe that Neutrogena would create this bad a product Its going straight in the garbage,0.145,0.099,0.756,0.5865,Positive

As a devoted user of Neutrogena products I am very disappointed in this one A product labeled dry touch and sheer should not feel sticky 15 minutes later and turn your skin a sickly blue cast I am sick of wasting money on products that are misrepresented I feel like a fool for not having saved my receipt so I could take this back to the store Dont buy this product unless u want to look like an alien,0.106,0.173,0.721,-0.7667,Negative

I woke up right after an over night skin treatment with glowing soft skin and then made the grave mistake of using this horrid product It left a hideous white film over my face and BURNED It completely undid all of the treatment I did the previous night and ON TOP OF THAT was so sticky and greasy it would not fade after 15 minutes Basically everything it said on the bottle proved to be false,0.031,0.113,0.855,-0.7644,Negative

I do not have sensitive skin and I have never had issues with SPF ingredients before but this product is a bad combination for my skin I bought this product because I was trying to avoid more toxic chemicals found in other SPFs but after using this for days I think it would be better to go without I broke out because of the formula Its very difficult to fully remove from your face even after a double cleanse I have fair skin but it did still leave a white sheen on my face Its stickier than most mineral SPFs Overall I was quite disappointed with the product and I would not recommend this to anyone,0.079,0.159,0.762,-0.8749,Negative
I have used Neutrogena sunscreen for years without issues Shopping one day and saw this new formula and it seemed great being that is contained more zinc and less chemicals however after my 1st attempt it will be thrown away I didnt even get to wear it to the pool I coated down let it dry for about 1520 minutes then put on my black tankini HUGE MISTAKE My black bathing suit had white streaks all over it it appear like deodorant streaks and would not come off of Neutrogena you have to do better this is ridiculous,0.117,0.053,0.83,0.7845,Positive

so if you have somebody if youre if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre having oily skin and if you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really want to,0.443,0.0,0.557,0.1513,Positive
look for a sunscreen which has dry touch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i think this is not the one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because this provides a very nice shine,0.382,0.0,0.618,0.4754,Positive
to my face this is um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not greasy exactly but its really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
moisturizing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and it really hydrates my skin because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is not exactly matte,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or dry touch i dont know why they have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
included in it or its just my skin that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it shines on my it brings a glow to my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
every skin is different so i just tried,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it on my skin ive been using it for one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
year but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yes it does give a very nice glow to my,0.453,0.0,0.547,0.6997,Positive
skin as soon as i put it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
my face glows differently i mean,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i dont need a serum underneath it i do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not put anything underneath it when im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
even if im home this is the only,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
product which,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is the only sunscreen which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
nongreasy but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also gives a very nice shine so i think,0.34,0.0,0.66,0.4754,Positive
if youre somebody,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if youre somebody with dry skin or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
combination skin i think its a very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
nice try for you,0.483,0.0,0.517,0.4215,Positive
all your skin types can use it in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
winters so its not exactly dry touch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh on my skin so you can try it out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
yourself,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so if youre somebody with oily skin i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
would recommend uh,0.556,0.0,0.444,0.3612,Positive
going with la shield or any sun cross,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
spf 50,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or any such sunscreens but not this one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because those are really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really dry touch not this one you should,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
apply every sunscreen 30 to 40 minutes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
before the sun exposure,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so i think which is applicable you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
reapply the sunscreen after every five,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to six hours depending on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
how much youre staying into the sun if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre somebody with issues like,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
freckles or pigmentation you should use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it even if youre staying at home,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because lights from our um phone screens,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
our tv screens our laptops are also very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very harmful,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for your skin and you should use a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
even if you are not stepping out so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats like a rule,0.556,0.0,0.444,0.3612,Positive
so yeah id rate it again 9 out of 10,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3597,Positive
because it is so amazing,0.549,0.0,0.451,0.7065,Positive
so overall i give 9 out of 10 to the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen because,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one point that i noticed was that claims,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like a non shiny finish and it claims,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
that it wont bring,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
any type of shine on your face its a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dry touch but its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not exactly a dry touch it really brings,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a very nice shine to my face,0.382,0.0,0.618,0.4754,Positive
which i take it as a plus point for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
myself but i dont know,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but in general uh thats that could be a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
plus point for some of you and that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
could not be a plus point for some of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so yeah if you have oily skin you can,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3597,Positive
definitely go for this one,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
in winters but you have dry skin or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
combination skin you can go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can go with this throughout the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
season so like for 12 months you,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4201,Positive

Neutrogena sunscreen review for this summer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Hey guys Welcome to my channel Today Im going to review and test two sunscreens,0.176,0.0,0.824,0.4588,Positive
from Neutrogena the sensitive skin one and the ultra sheer dry touch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Lets compare these at the same time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Im going to start with Neutrogena sensitive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin sunscreen As you can see the consistency of the sensitive skin its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very heavy and takes longer to absorb One thing that I noticed this is a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunblock so use it after your moisturizer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Personally I dont like it its kind of messy and greasy and you can keep white,0.0,0.274,0.726,-0.5998,Negative
residue in some parts of my face even if I try my best to spread it well,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.743,Positive
In general this sunblock is not my favorite and I dont recommend it to use it on,0.0,0.247,0.753,-0.5559,Negative
your face if you have acne or oily skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
My next review will be the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Drytouch I can tell you how lightweight this sunscreen is after I,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
apply it on my face as you can see looks and feels very clean no white residue and my,0.133,0.11,0.757,0.1317,Positive
skin does not get oily at all Also absorbs very fast,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Reading about the active ingredients the Neutrogena ultra sheer,0.252,0.0,0.748,0.4019,Positive
is a chemical sunscreen this means,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you have to apply this sunscreen before your moisturizer and wait about 15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
minutes before any sun exposure,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
In my opinion I totally recommend this one for,0.285,0.0,0.715,0.4201,Positive
people with oily skin and acne problems In general Im very satisfied about this,0.174,0.152,0.674,0.101,Positive
sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
And here you have the final review about these two Neutrogena,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

Mine is the Ultra Sheer See you guys next time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Pura Vida,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hello and welcome back to my channel i,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4588,Positive
have my headband on so i can apply a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and see how it goes i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
think i maybe have applied this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen once but i havent really used,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um this is the neutrogena sensitive skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mineral sunscreen broad spectrum spf 60,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
plus,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um this has titanium dioxide and zinc,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxide in it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it doesnt really make any claims about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
being sheer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um it is supposed to be for sensitive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which honestly is probably better with a,0.596,0.0,0.404,0.7096,Positive
mineral sunscreen because i feel like,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
those are the ones where i see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the most somewhat ridiculous claims,0.0,0.383,0.617,-0.3581,Negative
um i do have my quarter teaspoon so,0.167,0.0,0.833,0.0516,Positive
um for your face you are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
supposed to use a quarter teaspoon of,0.194,0.0,0.806,0.0516,Positive
sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um is the general recommendation got a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit too much so thats about a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quarter teaspoon,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.0516,Positive
youre recommended to put another,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.2023,Positive
quarter teaspoon,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.0516,Positive
on your neck and ears you dont want to,0.0,0.133,0.867,-0.0572,Negative
forget,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.2263,Negative
those areas and also around your eyes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the amount of sunscreen youre supposed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to use to get the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
spf on the bottle i believe is two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
milligrams per centimeter squared,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i feel like i should look that up so,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
that i make sure that im actually,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
saying the correct amount,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but thats what i think it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so with a nontinted mineral sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
generally i expect,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there to be some type of white cast i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
suppose um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
since i do have a fair skin tone i,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.3182,Positive
guess it is more likely that i can have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it blend into my skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay i got it all out of there this is,0.192,0.0,0.808,0.2263,Positive
the extra that i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wiped off at the beginning,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and honestly i might have a smaller face,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.4588,Positive
than the quarter teaspoon,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.0516,Positive
like recommendation is technically four,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but for the purposes of video i wanted,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
show you what a quarter teaspoon looks,0.194,0.0,0.806,0.0516,Positive
like,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3612,Positive
since that is the recommended amount,0.265,0.0,0.735,0.2023,Positive
of sunscreen to use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and im just gonna rub this in for a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little while and then ill probably let,0.0,0.318,0.682,-0.4215,Negative
it sit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for a little bit to see if it does sink,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in at all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it is um like a nice,0.639,0.0,0.361,0.6486,Positive
lotiony texture it has maybe a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit of a sunscreen scent,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um but its not like hard to rub around,0.13,0.24,0.63,-0.3007,Negative
or anything like that um,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
i dont feel its starting to pill um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay so thats the sunscreen on my face,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
i can definitely tell that some is on my,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4019,Positive
hands so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um thats something to keep in mind when,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre applying sunscreen is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um you know you want to get enough on,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
your face if youre applying it with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your hands like you probably are,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
um some is likely going to be on your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hands so thats part of the thing that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you want to keep in mind when youre,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
thinking about how much youre applying,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um so again like i said a quarter,0.357,0.0,0.643,0.4173,Positive
teaspoon might be a little bit much for,0.167,0.0,0.833,0.0516,Positive
me um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i dont know its hard to know exactly,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0762,Positive
how big my face is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um but i do really enjoy a lab muffin,0.441,0.0,0.559,0.6946,Positive
beauty science i think is her channel,0.432,0.0,0.568,0.5859,Positive
and shes actually like measured her,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
face and i think she found that she,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
needs less than a quarter teaspoon,0.0,0.21,0.79,-0.0164,Neutral
by quite a fair amount so if you do have,0.245,0.0,0.755,0.3804,Positive
a smaller face,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or like a similar face size to that,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
i think that its reasonable to assume,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that the amount that ends up on your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hands,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
from rubbing it in may kind of cover for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the amount that you dont need on your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
face,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um but regardless its always probably,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
better to,0.744,0.0,0.256,0.4404,Positive
lean towards a little bit more than a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit less but shes all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
shes also talked about that as well,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
obviously the best sunscreen is one that,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
youll wear,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and applying too much can potentially,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cause a problem as well,0.309,0.397,0.294,-0.1531,Negative
um just because you know youre wasting,0.0,0.31,0.69,-0.4019,Negative
money at some point um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
by applying too much sunscreen and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre losing some of that um cosmetic,0.0,0.302,0.698,-0.3818,Negative
elegance of it sitting on your skin,0.341,0.0,0.659,0.4767,Positive
so that may make you more or may make,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you less likely to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
use it um and i know she did a whole,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
video talking about like why you,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
shouldnt apply,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
too much sunscreen either and i cant,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
off the top of my head think about the,0.184,0.0,0.816,0.2023,Positive
other things that she,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
discussed um i dont know if its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
potentially more likely for it to like,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
transfer off your face if you have too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
much on your face,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um but um heres the extra amount that i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
didnt apply to my face because i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
overfilled the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
teaspoon so,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.0516,Positive
its definitely like a nice texture i,0.8,0.0,0.2,0.7906,Positive
think if i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
could rub it in with like a little bit,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
less rubbing in um it would keep a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit of a nicer texture because,0.345,0.0,0.655,0.3892,Positive
its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it almost gets a little bit more it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
almost loses some of its elegance as you,0.279,0.181,0.54,0.2716,Positive
rub it in i cant describe exactly how,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so there is it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
my two hands for comparisons you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kind of see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the white cast on my hand um there,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
definitely is a little bit there for me,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
its kind of like a pinkish,0.356,0.0,0.644,0.2975,Positive
tint that i think is there on my skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so straight off the bat,0.354,0.0,0.646,0.2944,Positive
i dont know if this is a nano,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
zinc oxide or not in it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but the white cast doesnt look that bad,0.35,0.0,0.65,0.5824,Positive
for an spf 60 plus,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mineral only sunscreen um obviously like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
this isnt a good like its not good to,0.0,0.581,0.419,-0.7115,Negative
have white gas,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

that ive seen im going to let it sink,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

15 minutes to see if theres any fading,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of the white cast in that amount of time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

this working for people if you dont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mind having some of that white cast,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and like covering it up with makeup or,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
maybe a tinted sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which definitely is an option,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
i do think the white cast on this is not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the worst one,0.0,0.672,0.328,-0.6249,Negative
that ive had and it doesnt feel drying,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

work for people,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um if you want to put in the work for a,0.126,0.0,0.874,0.0772,Positive
mineral sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

to say either way so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im not sure on that what i do like,0.239,0.188,0.574,0.1376,Positive
about it is that it isnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a very matte finish i wouldnt say its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
super dewy or hydrating either its just,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.5994,Positive
kind of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
natural maybe leaning a little bit more,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
hydrating but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it just overall feels fine on my skin it,0.184,0.0,0.816,0.2023,Positive

and let you know what i think,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um after some more time but so far,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its not the worst,0.523,0.0,0.477,0.5096,Positive
not the best so thank you so much for,0.238,0.247,0.514,-0.0327,Neutral

apply this sunscreen it can feel a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit heavy um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the skin almost like its suffocating,0.269,0.0,0.731,0.2975,Positive
my skin a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i get a little bit hot um just from the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feeling on my face like it doesnt feel,0.4,0.0,0.6,0.4588,Positive
hot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh just when i apply it it does feel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heavy but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
after a little bit of time you know 15,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
20 minutes it feels pretty normal i,0.39,0.0,0.61,0.4939,Positive
dont really notice it on my skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the sunscreen throughout the day when,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im wearing it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
doesnt feel super heavy or anything it,0.0,0.344,0.656,-0.4847,Negative
just feels,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um neutral and it does kind of have a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
neutral finish as well,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.2732,Positive
it looks a little bit shiny here but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that pretty much dissipates and it has a,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
neutral finish as i wear it during the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
day,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it does however have that white cast um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i find that if i dont do a good job,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.3412,Negative
blending it in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it will be a little bit streaky so you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
do want to make sure that youre,0.419,0.0,0.581,0.3818,Positive
you know checking how well you applied,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
it and everything like that,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
um so you dont get a white cast thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as bad,0.0,0.778,0.222,-0.5423,Negative
i think it looks much better if your,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
white cast is um smooth versus streaky,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but overall you know this applies over,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
itself fine i dont have any pilling,0.265,0.0,0.735,0.2023,Positive
issues,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
um its you know not the worst,0.354,0.0,0.646,0.5096,Positive
high spf mineral sunscreen that ive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tried um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just because it does have that neutral,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
finish and the white cast isnt,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
extremely pronounced um and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it feels fairly neutral on the skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not too heavy um not too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dewy or greasy or matte everything is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty neutral with it so overall i,0.39,0.0,0.61,0.4939,Positive
think this is fine i will say its not,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
very sweat resistant,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i dont know if thats different from,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
water resistance but if i sweat it will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh become more white and run with the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sweat,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to an extent on my skin uh but overall i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
didnt have any issues,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with using this and ill,0.0,0.412,0.588,-0.4215,Negative
continue doing so and update you if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there are any changes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i plan to do a roundup video of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
drugstore sunscreens at some point so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ill talk further about it then,0.0,0.359,0.641,-0.4215,Negative
hi guys im anisha and welcome back to,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.4588,Positive
my channel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
today in this video im going to review,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
two very popular neutrogena sunscreens,0.436,0.0,0.564,0.4754,Positive
which you can find literally everywhere,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so one of these is a physical or a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mineral based sunscreen the other one is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a chemical sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we start off by knowing what exactly is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the difference between physical,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen and a chemical sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then well move on to my opinion,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
about these and what i would recommend,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
depending upon your skin type and other,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin issues,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so lets get started so talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
physical sunscreens they use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mineral chemical filters which are zinc,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
oxide or titanium dioxide or sometimes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
both so how this works is it creates a,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
physical barrier upon the skin,0.0,0.273,0.727,-0.128,Negative
and it reflects the uv rays so it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
creates like a shield on the surface of,0.479,0.0,0.521,0.5574,Positive
the skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and whereas chemical sunscreens it use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
chemical uv filters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
most common are octane oxide oxybenzone,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
arrow benzone etc so what it does it it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
absorbs the uv rays and converts it into,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heat which is then released by our skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
physical sunscreens are generally,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thicker they are hard to blend,0.0,0.219,0.781,-0.1027,Negative
and they will give you a white cast on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your face,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also these are recommended to people,0.265,0.0,0.735,0.2023,Positive
with sensitive skin or rosacea prone,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin etc,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whereas chemical sunscreen will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
generally lighter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it will be easier to blend wont give,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
you a white cast which is a great point,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.6249,Positive
and is recommended to people,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.2023,Positive
with oily skin and usually deeper skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tones so that it wont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
give a white cast so more or less these,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were the basic differences between a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
physical and a chemical sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now lets move on and look at the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
products the first one i have is this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the neutrogena shear zinc dry touch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen with spf 50 plus and pa,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
plus it is an 80 ml bottle which retails,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for 850 rupees and this one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is targeted to people with sensitive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so this one is a physical sunscreen or a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mineral based sunscreen and the mineral,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
used is zinc oxide,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now zinc oxide is a really great,0.468,0.0,0.532,0.659,Positive
ingredient as it gives protection,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
against all forms of uva and uvb,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
rays and other environmental damages so,0.0,0.367,0.633,-0.4404,Negative
you will get a broad spectrum protection,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also the other good thing about this one,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
is that it is fragrance free,0.398,0.0,0.602,0.5106,Positive
and hypoallergenic so it will be great,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.6249,Positive
for people with sensitive skin or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
any skin type for that matter the,0.155,0.0,0.845,0.0258,Neutral
downside though is that,0.0,0.4,0.6,-0.25,Negative
that it is a little bit thick its not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
greasy but youll have to take your time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to work it in your skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the other thing is that it will give you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a good amount of white cast,0.42,0.0,0.58,0.4404,Positive
though it is true for all zinc based,0.286,0.0,0.714,0.4215,Positive
sunscreens youll have to make it a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
point,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because we have indian skin tones and we,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont want to look like ghosts,0.324,0.158,0.518,0.3134,Positive
the trick is to take a little bit and,0.0,0.146,0.854,-0.0516,Negative
apply it work it in your skin then take,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
another bit and work it in your skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like youre layering your sunscreen,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
the other thing that you can do is if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you do wear makeup you can add a little,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
darker colored foundation or cc cream,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with it so that it becomes a tinted,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen if that makes sense and it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
wont,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
give you a white cast that bad the other,0.0,0.333,0.667,-0.5423,Negative
one is the neutrogena ultra shear dry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
touch sunblock,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with spf 50 plus pa triple plus now this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one is 88,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ml and it retails for 550 rupees,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one it says that it has helioplex,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
technology,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which represents a breadth of stabilized,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreens engineered to deliver broad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
spectrum protection,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now keep in mind that this is a chemical,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and chemical uv filters often provide,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
protection against either uva,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or uvb rays they are also very weak and,0.0,0.285,0.715,-0.4927,Negative
photo unstable,0.0,0.714,0.286,-0.3612,Negative
so what would brands do is they would,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mix in three or more of these different,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
chemical uv filters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
engineer it to be stable and work,0.268,0.0,0.732,0.296,Positive
properly together,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so that the product gives a broad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
spectrum protection,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i leave the names of the uv filters used,0.0,0.146,0.854,-0.0516,Negative
in this one on the screen somewhere,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as it is a chemical sunscreen it will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lighter on the skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it will be easier to blend and it wont,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.4215,Positive
give you a white cast,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is great but the problem arises,0.23,0.32,0.45,-0.25,Negative
with the chemical uv filters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there are a few concerns well with,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
oxybenzone in particular so lets see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what these are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
number one is that our skin absorbs,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
these ingredients,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the traces of these chemical uv filters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have been found in human breast milk,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
urine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and blood now it is said that this can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
potentially disrupt the hormones of our,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
body,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but it is not clinically significant as,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.2235,Negative
to what extent,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but due to these concerns it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
advisable for women that are pregnant,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or who are breastfeeding to avoid the,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.296,Negative
use of physical sunscreens,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
number two oxybenzone is allergenic and,0.206,0.0,0.794,0.0772,Positive
can cause skin reactions such as redness,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and itchiness,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if you do already have a sensitive skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it is advisable to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not use a chemical sunscreen and move to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a physical sunscreen instead,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and number three it is believed that,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.0772,Positive
oxybenzone and other chemical uv filters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can potentially harm the ocean,0.0,0.467,0.533,-0.5423,Negative
by damaging the coral reef now some,0.0,0.355,0.645,-0.5106,Negative
places like hawaii have even,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
banned the sales of sunscreens that use,0.0,0.333,0.667,-0.4588,Negative
that are formulated with these chemical,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uv filters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now there is no such pan in india but it,0.0,0.151,0.849,-0.1531,Negative
is advisable for people that are surfers,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
diverse swimmers or just people visiting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the beaches to use a physical,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or mineral based sunscreen instead so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
apart from the debatable,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
chemical uv filters this as most of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
other neutrogena products,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
also contains undisclosed fragrance now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fragrance can give you a sensorial,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
experience,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but its not good for your skin and,0.0,0.308,0.692,-0.4782,Negative
especially in a formula like,0.48,0.0,0.52,0.4144,Positive
sunscreen which you do have to reapply,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
every two to three hours,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and in a good amount its not good for,0.492,0.0,0.508,0.7003,Positive
your skin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay so once more lets do a quick,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
comparison between the two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is a physical sunscreen this one is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a chemical sunscreen this has zinc oxide,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this has other chemical uv filters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one is cheaper it wont give you a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
white cast,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this will give you a white cast it is a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thick and this one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
has no fragrance this one has fragrance,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.296,Negative
so final thoughts i have purchased both,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of them and i use both of them,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but if i do have to recommend you one i,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.5023,Positive
would suggest you go for the sheer zinc,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i know it will give you a white cast and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
deeper the complexion,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
severe the white cast but again this is,0.0,0.205,0.795,-0.2023,Negative
safer,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4215,Positive
the formulation is better it is a little,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
bit thick but its not greasy and it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
will work on all skin types,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im going to leave it on that and well,0.204,0.117,0.68,0.2263,Positive
you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
make your own decision yourself you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the skincare industry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

makeup and which one should you wear to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the beach or swimming or does it even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
matter is it all just marketing on the,0.136,0.0,0.864,0.0258,Neutral
packaging,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as a practicing dermatologist i get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

of brands as well as specific products,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
within those brands,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so i really spend a lot of time on this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
topic and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
after reviewing all 52 sunscreens on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
neutrogena website,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
here is my breakdown of the hits and the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
misses for you,0.0,0.487,0.513,-0.2263,Negative
but first the basics neutrogena offers,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in three main categories you have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lotions,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sprays and sunscreen sticks you will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have the most,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
options to choose from in lotions then,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sprays,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and the least amount of options in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sticks so this choice really comes down,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to user preference,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as a general rule myself and most,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dermatologists recommend lotions,0.556,0.0,0.444,0.3612,Positive
as these tend to be more effective,0.361,0.0,0.639,0.5256,Positive
sticks can also be effective if applied,0.341,0.0,0.659,0.4767,Positive
in an appropriate quantity and sprays,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
are generally the least effective as,0.0,0.338,0.662,-0.3724,Negative
coverage tends to be much less than,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
recommended so,0.643,0.0,0.357,0.2023,Positive
deciding on this category is one of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
first steps in selecting your sunscreen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the other big choice that you have to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
make is choosing between a chemical,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
versus a mineral sunscreen now im not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
too indepth about the formulation of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunscreens in this video but instead,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ill just tell you a few key points,0.0,0.318,0.682,-0.4215,Negative
about chemical versus mineral sunscreens,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just enough info so that you can choose,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which one you prefer and ultimately,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you will understand my final,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
recommendations okay so chemical,0.388,0.0,0.612,0.2263,Positive
sunscreens,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
use chemicals to protect your skin from,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
the sun,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
they work by absorbing the uv radiation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in the harmful spectrum,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and they convert it to low energy heat,0.206,0.206,0.588,0.0,Neutral
which dissipates and prevents sun damage,0.153,0.376,0.471,-0.4404,Negative
compare this to mineral sunscreens,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which use minerals to protect you from,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
the sun now the mineral sunscreens sit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on top of the skin and reflect the,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
sunlight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
off rather than absorbing it you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tell which type of sunscreen it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
by flipping it over and looking at the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
back on the ingredients label,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
under active ingredients you will see,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
either chemicals,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or minerals or a combination of both,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
listed here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so there are six chemicals commonly used,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in sunscreens in the united states,0.359,0.0,0.641,0.4215,Positive
examples of these include oxybenzone and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
avobinzone which are really commonly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
used,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in our sunscreens and there are two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mineral blockers that are available in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the us,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in sunscreens and these are zinc oxide,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and titanium dioxide so both chemicals,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and minerals are very effective,0.459,0.0,0.541,0.5256,Positive
at broad spectrum coverage meaning they,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
protect against uva,0.565,0.0,0.435,0.3818,Positive
and uvb rays so what do i recommend,0.315,0.0,0.685,0.4144,Positive
chemical or mineral,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heres the deal chemical sunscreens have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the most,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
controversy surrounding them for four,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
main,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
reasons that is alarming to the public,0.0,0.2,0.8,-0.128,Negative
first,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

The recommended amount although everyone needs a different amount of sunscreen should only be a nickel size Although it says to apply liberally going a little heavyhanded can cause a white cast I recommend dotting sunscreen over your whole face little by little lightly tapping or massaging until an even white cast appears over the whole face and then massage it in to minimise the cast,0.068,0.0,0.932,0.5106,Positive
