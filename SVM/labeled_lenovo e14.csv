Bought from seller OEMGenuine All things are fine regarding Seller and Condition I would purchase another Laptop from OEMGenuine if I needed toThe Laptop itself is bad Thinkpad E14 modelThere is no CDDVD Drive you have to buy an external One if you want to do something as basic as watch DVDs on it now I guess Computer Manufacturers have decided for Us that nobody wants that anymoreThere is no Number Pad Some people dont care about Number pads but this Laptop doesnt even give you the Option to ignore it There just isnt One You will have to buy an external Number Pad if you want OneThere are bright white LED Indicators for Key Locks and also for the Power Button and they cannot be disabled When the Laptop is in Sleep Mode it will slowly pulse its white Light and illuminate the whole Room at Night Only the Laptop can sleep through this The LEDs are eyesores even with normal usage White is an inappropriate color for an LED Indicator on a LaptopThe keyboard has chiclet style Keys in an island style so theyre built into a plastic Frame with individual gaps for each Key and the Keys rise out of the Gaps Proponents of this Keyboard Style sometimes say that it helps keep Debris from getting under the Keys But they are wrong Debris will get into the Keys unless you are Computing in a Sterile Laboratory and when Debris does get under one of the Keys you cant pry the Key up to remove the Debris even a little bit and you cant shoot compressed Air underneath the Key to dislodge it You will just have to mash the key around and try to crunch the Debris into slightly less intrusive Grit Bear in mind that we suggest NOT removing the Keys manually for cleaning  Chiclet Key Retainers love to break when lifted from AboveVery poor design Decisions made for such an expensive Laptop It used to be that spending more Money would get you more or better Features Now it just buys sharper Build Quality and prestigious Brand Name,0.074,0.05,0.876,0.7787,Positive
As a teacher in the realm of distance teaching I have a lot of programs that I need to use at once concurrently with live streaming so multitasking without lag was a must when I bought a new PC  Ive believed in Intel i7 processors for many years now and 32GB of RAM was my goal  Even in a matter of a day my programs are all zooming along at once as I reinstalled Windows on an NVMe SSD in the m2 slot near the standard SATA III SSD which acts as storage in my setup  Ive never had a more potent or quieter laptopThe 14 display is a perfect size for me and having the ThinkShutter to block the camera is a big help in terms of privacyLongevity and durability is always a waiting game but I believe in how well this PC was crafted  I recommend this ThinkPad E14 i732GB RAM1 TB SSD setup wholeheartedly,0.086,0.013,0.901,0.8338,Positive
I was looking for a relatively quiet low fan noise laptop that had enough power to run some occasionally heavy load software like simulators or compilers I also didnt want to pay for a touch screen which I know Ill never use I detest finger prints on the screen Although not the fastest machine on the market this 15W  I5 processor allows the machine to quickly chew through many tough applications and do it quietly It was delivered ahead of the original estimate and arrived in perfect condition Im very happy with the power and size of this machine and would recommend it to anyone looking for a small quiet laptop that looks like its built to last,0.165,0.06,0.775,0.9255,Positive

The Thinkpad E490 by Lenovo is a great computer very impressed The keyboard is perfect and a dream to type on I just got a new larger laptop and my Lenovo now a backup machine is still my favorite to type on If your a writer or do a lot of writing Id say check out this line of laptops I would have gotten a new Lenovo 15 but their 15 all have a keypad on the keyboard which makes the unit to wide for lap use,0.128,0.0,0.872,0.8223,Positive

I bought the computer in July and in November my HDD died I consider myself as a normal standard user I dont change anything in computers settings and mostly use the computer for preparing classes I giveComputer was working pretty nicely until I turned it off and the next morning I got into a boot loop and the system couldnt boot at all Why No idea I didnt do anything special as I did the other days I took it to the local technical service where I was told that the HDD is somehow damaged and to get at least some of my data it requires a WinLocker passwordI immediately contacted OEMGenuine and their technical support They answered once on my email and didnt provide any asnwer related to the passwordprotected HDD and since then its week of silenceI do need help and I kindly ask for it Please be a responsible company and let your customers at least know that you are alive and try to solve somethingI dont have very expensive computer working nor my data nor any responseITS FEBRUARY 2021 AND NO ONE ANSWERED 3 MONTHS PLEASE BE CAREFUL SUCH A SHAME,0.14,0.085,0.775,0.8534,Positive

I bought this laptop under the impression it was new however three months in and randomly the laptop DIES and never shuts back on I take it to our companys IT and a Lenovo service center and the experts tell me the slated drive has been switched from the original and isnt under warranty I was completely blown because the product was NOT listed as refurbished and I had work files open during the time it died I would highly recommend to avoid buying products from this seller,0.078,0.067,0.855,-0.0183,Neutral

The laptop ran unbelievably slow even after updating Windows and all drivers It took upwards of 10 minutes to start up and took about 5 minutes to open any program even just a simple browserWhen I called technical support they asked me to update Windows and the drivers I already had done that After that they said Id have to send the laptop in for repairs a brand new laptopWhen I tried to get a refund they said it was past the 30 day policy the laptop was purchased by my brother in November and given to me as a Christmas present  it was past the 30 days before I even opened it and that I couldnt get a refundI would not recommend this laptop as it did not work as expected even brand new Moreover I wouldnt recommend any Lenovo products as their technical support and customer service is very difficult to work with I did not feel like I was taken care of as a customer,0.053,0.056,0.892,0.1222,Positive

This think is a super quite powerhouse I recently had my Alienware 17xR3 stolen and needed another laptop time for a upgrade anyways This thing is legit one of the best laptops I have ever owned Wanted something a bit smaller than the 17in that I had and this laptop is great for the price Super thin and super light,0.281,0.045,0.674,0.9571,Positive
I have owned this laptop for over a year and use it everyday for work This is an excellent machine for typical business users The machine has plenty of CPU power memory and disk for my needs It boots Windows 10 fast and I have had zero hardware problems I really like the Battery Charge Threshold feature This sets the maximum charge on the battery to 80 which prolongs battery life not runtime if the laptop is mostly used while plugged into AC The screen is clear and crisp We have kids in college and this is my 4th Lenovo laptop purchase I have a gaming rig desktop so I cannot say if it runs games but it does run Roblox just fine,0.068,0.026,0.906,0.6306,Positive
these come with USA power adaptors  so not useful in AUS,0.0,0.212,0.788,-0.3988,Negative
The Lenovo ThinkPad E14 is an office laptop which is not as slim as the devices from the Xseries and there are not as many features as on the Tseries but the laptops often cost only half the price and they offer all the important things you need to work Lenovo also fixes one major complaint and equips the new ThinkPad E14 G3 with brighter displays and there is also an optional screen with 100 sRGB coverage,0.068,0.034,0.898,0.4215,Positive
Lenovo did not change the chassis and the black design might appear a bit boring but it is definitely functional You can notice the low price in terms of materials because you get a combination of plastic and aluminum lid and bottom panel The stability is still good and you cannot twist or dent the base unit no creaking sounds The lid itself is also sturdy but we can quickly provoke picture distortions with concentrated pressure on the back and twisting attempts The hinges are well adjusted and there is only minor bouncing,0.094,0.126,0.779,-0.34,Negative
The E14 G3 is the heaviest and largest device in our comparison group it is noticeably deeper in terms of footprint The USBC power adapter tips the scale at around 360 grams,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The port situation is still the same even though we would appreciate some updates You get a USBC port including charging functionality as well as DisplayPort and a fullsize HDMI output but a slow USB 20 port is not really appropriate for a laptop in 2021 More expensive ThinkPad models like the Tseries definitely have an advantage in this regard,0.199,0.0,0.801,0.8934,Positive
Lenovo uses a WiFi 6 module from RealTek but the transfer rates are lower compared to  which was equipped with the Intel AX200 It is now a 1x1 module 160 MHz with a maximum transfer rate of 866 Mbps The signal quality was always good during our review period The E14 G3 also offers a Gigabit Ethernet port but there are no WWAN modules available,0.058,0.084,0.858,-0.1901,Negative
As expected you only get a simple 720p webcam 09 MP with a mechanical shutter ThinkShutter which takes pretty bad pictures There is also an IR camera for facial recognition via Windows Hello,0.09,0.098,0.812,-0.0772,Negative
Similar to previous ThinkPad E laptops you can remove the whole bottom cover but the process is not simple The panel is still extremely tight after you have removed all the screws and there are plenty of plastic clips that can break easily Other ThinkPad models are much easier to open,0.121,0.044,0.835,0.6486,Positive
The warranty once again shows the entrylevel position of the ThinkPad E14 because our test unit only comes with a oneyear warranty You can still extend the duration for an additional price Some models of the E14 are also sold with a twoyear warranty,0.04,0.0,0.96,0.1779,Positive
The ThinkPad E14 G3 still gets the familiar and excellent keyboard with 18 mm travel and rich feedback Despite the low price the E14 has a big advantage over much more expensive ThinkPad X models which are now equipped with shallower and flatter keyboards You will definitely be happy when you write a lot and the E14 G3 also comes with a twostage background illumination,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.951,Positive
The displays have always been a problem of the inexpensive ThinkPad E14series The picture quality was okay for an office laptop but the brightness was hardly competitive at around 250 nits Lenovo now improved the situation and our test unit is the default IPS screen with an advertised brightness of 300 nits and our test unit even manages 330 nits There is also an optional panel with full sRGB coverage if you want to edit pictures Some regions also get an inexpensive TN panel with a brightness of 250 nits but we would not recommend this option,0.172,0.041,0.786,0.9238,Positive
We analyzed the display with the professional CalMAN software and the grayscale is already very accurate out of the box There is only a minor blue cast but it is not visible with the naked eye The colors on the other hand clearly show that it is an inexpensive IPS screen with limited color gamut 60 sRGB and we can see huge deviations compared to the sRGB reference color space,0.138,0.03,0.832,0.8573,Positive
We calibrated the panel XRite i1 Pro 2 and the corresponding profile can be downloaded in the box above The grayscale improved a bit but the colors still show high deviations,0.068,0.0,0.932,0.2617,Positive
The additional brightness is definitely appreciated outdoors and you have a little bit more headroom but you should still get a place in the shade for the most comfortable viewing experience,0.3,0.0,0.7,0.8654,Positive
Our review unit is equipped with the  with 6 cores 12 threads and a maximum clock of 4 GHZ More technical information about the CPU is available ,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
The new ThinkPad E14 beats the rivals in multicore benchmarks Tiger Lake based laptops are much slower and even the 45W processor  in the  is slower than the AMD chip If you only stress one core however the Intel chips have an advantage We should mention that Intel CPUs often benefit from high power limits for short peak load which is not the case for the AMD chip in the E14 The performance is not reduced on battery power,0.06,0.033,0.907,0.296,Positive
Talking about the overall system performance the new ThinkPad E14 G3 leaves a great impression The results in the synthetic benchmarks confirm our subjective impression the device executes inputs very quickly and there are no bottlenecks in the system configuration You can expand the memory up to 40 GB 8 GB onboard  1 RAM slot up to 32 GB,0.161,0.035,0.804,0.7906,Positive
Our standardized latency test web browsing YouTube 4K playback CPU load shows increased latencies for the ThinkPad E14 G3 so there can be problems when you use realtime audio applications,0.064,0.082,0.854,-0.1531,Negative
The ThinkPad E14 G3 has two SSD slots Our review unit was equipped with a compact M22242 module from SK Hynix BC711 and a storage capacity of 512 GB 435 GB free after initial setup Both drives are attached via PCIe30 x4 and the transfer rates are good Thanks to the empty M22280 slot it is very easy to upgrade the storage capacity if necessary More SSD benchmarks can be found ,0.157,0.023,0.82,0.8883,Positive
The Ryzen 5 5500U is equipped with the integrated Radeon RX Vega 7 which is basically the old  we already know from Ryzen 4000 chips More technical information about the iGPU is available  This is also the case for the performance which benefits from the dualchannel memory configuration but it is on the expected level in general Intels integrated  which is also available in the Intel model of the  for example is a bit faster in the synthetic benchmarks,0.023,0.0,0.977,0.2023,Positive
The difference between the Vega 7 and the Iris Xe Graphics G7 96 EUs is much smaller in the actual gaming benchmarks Gaming is possible on the E14 G3 but you are usually limited to low or medium settings to get smooth gameplay More gaming benchmarks with the Vega 7 are available ,0.0,0.094,0.906,-0.6124,Negative
The new E14 G3 still uses a single fan and it is a very quiet device overall Compared to many Intel based laptops there is no high power limit so the fan usually does not start spinning in short peak load scenarios The noise level is still convenient when you stress the CPU and the iGPU simultaneously and there are no annoying frequencies We did not notice any other electronic sounds like coil whine on our test unit either,0.08,0.14,0.78,-0.6486,Negative
The ThinkPad E14 G3 is not uncomfortable warm despite the quiet fan We can determine almost 50 C at the bottom during the stress test and you should not put the device on your lap in this scenario but there are no limitations in everyday situations The fan speed is a bit lower when you play games like Witcher 3 so the chassis is even a bit warmer,0.139,0.165,0.697,-0.0039,Neutral
We can once again see that the consumption levels off at 30 Watts during the stress test There are some fluctuations after about 10 minutes but the performance is very stable in general and there is no major drop The processor runs at 6x 2628 GHz and the iGPU at 450 MHz There is no performance reduction immediately after the stress test,0.044,0.189,0.766,-0.8628,Negative
The two stereo speakers once again carry the same Harman branding and we cannot notice a difference from the previous model The result is surprisingly good for an inexpensive office device and you can easily enjoy some videos or some background music Conferences benefit from the good representation of high tones which is great for clear voices,0.327,0.0,0.673,0.9694,Positive
Our consumption measurements show slight improvements because the idle values are comparable or even slightly better compared to the ThinkPad E14 G2 both Intel as well as AMD despite the brighter display AMD system behave differently under load since there are no increased power limits for short periods so the consumption is stable We determine up to 55W during the stress test so the compact 65W power adapter USBC is completely sufficient,0.166,0.085,0.748,0.7025,Positive
Lenovo increased the battery capacity to 57 Wh and this obviously has a positive effect on the battery runtime Almost all the rivals including the two models of the ThinkPad E14 G2 both AMD as well as Intel are clearly beaten Our WiFi test at an adjusted brightness of 150 nits results in almost 115 hours and still more than 8 hours at the maximum brightness It seems that AMD laptops with shorter battery runtime are a thing of the past The video test benefits from the more efficient video decoder with a runtime of almost 14 hours,0.196,0.026,0.778,0.9485,Positive
The third generation of the ThinkPad E14 is once again a good office laptop with a great priceperformance ratio You do not get the most highend specs or best materials but the notebook does not disappoint in the important sections and it is once again equipped with an excellent keyboard which is not the case anymore for many more expensive ThinkPads The keyboard is also a big advantage compared to the rivals,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.9567,Positive

Great review with everything I need to know I think I39m going to go with one of these I39m not a business user but a home user that likes to tinker with things like some music production and digital drawing and some legacy gaming where I don39t need a majorly powerful GPU although it looks like the integrated Radeon in the Ryzen 4000 series is nothing to sneeze at either My reason for honing in on a Thinkpad though is that I value the durability and upgradeability as I usually keep my laptops for 5 years or more plus with this E series model it doesn39t really cost much more than a lot of consumer laptops with Ryzen and similar specs I can take the quotcost cuttingquot measures of the E series as I really don39t need that many ports nice that this still has full sized HDMI and a flipdown Ethernet jack that doesn39t need a dongle though and it also loses the 2 signature silver hinges from the L series and up but I think this one actually looks cleaner Another reason is nostalgia The first laptop I bought with my own money after doing odd summer jobs as a kid was a somewhat gutted IBMmade Thinkpad from circa 1997 used on eBay I forget the exact model I found all the missing components like a refurbished battery AC adapter RAM a decently large hard drive a PCMCIA modem card family was still on dailup ugh and the CD ROM drive it had one of those hotswappable drive bays remember those I later got the floppy disk one too and installed Windows XP which was current at the time and had a really decent computer for cheap Other than a number of modern developments like thinness and display bezel size the basic shape and design of these newer Lenovo Thinkpads really hasn39t changed all that much I39m excited to mess around with the TouchPoint nib too as I got really good with it on my childhood Thinkpad because it only had the TouchPoint as an onboard pointing device and no touchpad That webcam is kinda meh but looks perfectly serviceable for video calls and it looks like it has decent low light performance too It39s no worse I think that the webcams in MacBooks that cost twice as much I think they still use 720p webcams,0.129,0.078,0.793,0.9767,Positive

Lenovo is bad and poor qualityI purchased a LENOVO Thinkpad just about an year ago in Nov 2020 However the laptop just started crumbling around the hingearea Bad construct and casing brRaised this with Lenovo and they refused to get this fixed and claim this is just out of warranty Even when I am willing to pay they now claim they have no parts Bunch of crap and extremely poor service Unfortunately the laptop works fine just that it cannot be closed or opened as the entire casing is just crumbling I recommend that you talk about quality and service records as well so your subscribers can be warned Thanks,0.072,0.205,0.723,-0.9438,Negative

I rejoice that you found a laptop that seems to work for you Personally I noticed some things about this Nano which were not so enticing for me First Lenovo rates the weight at 219 lbs for the touch screen model and 227 if it has WWAN so it isn39t really under 2 lbs Second the display is only 2K which is a dealbreaker for me I39d rather get the X1 Carbon at 24 lbs with a 4K display Right now I am watchingand writingon a new Samsung Tab S7 13 lbs which has a 120 HZ Super AMOLED 3K display and weights considerably under 2 lbs even with a keyboard For photo pros the higher resolution is just too important to consider weight as the biggest selling feature Also with any lightweight device having pen input is so sweet and adds tremendous value note taking drawing letter writing etc that I wouldn39t even look at any lightweight computing device without it Fortunately we can each chose from many different offerings to get what is best for us Thanks for your great YouTube content creation,0.147,0.0,0.853,0.9802,Positive

I39ve got a ThinkPad X1 Carbon 6 and although there39s a lot that I really love about it there are a  few things about it that soured it for me I found that when using it on my lap or my desk pad the fan intake gets blocked and it ends up getting hot and loud I really hate that they put that tiny air intake there I also noticed that if you plug it into a 60w charger while using it the top left of the keyboard gets uncomfortably hot because of the fast charging Finally the USB C ports feel really mushy and weak and a plastic bit even broke off the inside of one of the ports a couple of months after getting it I ended up replacing it with a 12quot MacBook Pro which doesn39t suffer from any of the issues above but the keyboard isn39t nearly as good and I don39t think it looks or feels as good in the hand They39ve really got to fix that stupid vent position,0.098,0.092,0.81,0.471,Positive

They are quite similar The E14 is a bit cheaper but doesn39t have the same ports doesn39t come with touchscreen and can39t have as much computing power But an E14 and L14 with similar specs are incredibly closely matched If I39m not mistaken the L14 is slightly bigger too,0.054,0.0,0.946,0.395,Positive

The acer swift doesnt offer the same build quality as the ThinkPad and since you are using it at school like me the ThinkPad will be a better option The acer often offers better priceperformance tho My E14 is brilliant for everything you described above And the keyboard is WAY better on the ThinkPad and that is a big deal while writing essays and such,0.228,0.0,0.772,0.9413,Positive

Moggelishes Yeah the Ryzen 4000 series is super powerful for a laptop the models with them definitely will last longer than these Comet Lake models which also are more expensive But I think I will be going with the Ryzen 5 4500U 8256 model because I found it for an amazing price and always I can add more RAM or a second SSD,0.203,0.0,0.797,0.9001,Positive

Moggelishes  I39m planning on getting the Huawei Matebook D14 Ryzen 5 4500u 16gb RAM 512gb SSD I39m comparing it against the R5 version of the E14 and I39m honestly confused on what to get They39re pretty much the same and I think E14 has better specs overall but I also prefer D1439s lighter weight and its allaluminum chassis because I39m not so fond of the plastic bottom and red accents I know it sounds stupid to pick aesthetics over a bit of performance but what do you think And do you have any other suggestions at this price point ,0.058,0.099,0.843,-0.7386,Negative
I was looking so much at the D14 Honestly I WANTED that one instead But that was only available with ryzen 3000 series at the time So I just couldn39t then If you can get it now with a 4000 series processor then go for the one you LIKE the most Keyboard is better on E14 tho keep that in mind ,0.164,0.0,0.836,0.8909,Positive
Moggelishes Can I ask you one more thing Which one has better display the D14 or E14 I hear they both have up to 250 nits display but I can39t seem to find a proper comparison between the two and I haven39t seen either one up close so I couldn39t really tell,0.042,0.0,0.958,0.2382,Positive

Moggelishes Woops I39m a girl btw hahaha but it39s alright brI suggest you make a quotlong termquot review on the E14 for starters It would help a lot of us who are planning to use it for a couple of years or more Maybe you could also make comparison videos between different models or even suggestion videos of budgetfriendly laptops with specs along the lines of the E14 like the Lenovo Xiaoxin 13 Pro I barely see any decent review about this Hope this could somehow give you an idea Good luck ,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.9751,Positive

I have no past experience with Thinkpad E Series but all I can say is that there is nothing to complain about in terms of ruggedness The aluminum top gives it a premium feel and paired with a good hinge this screen doesn39t wobble or shake at all The bottom is a high quality plastic that feels good it39s not like an aluminum laptop but damn close The only small things I39ve found are that the USBC port doesn39t feel 100 satisfying and the cable can wiggle a tiny bit TLDR It39s definitely solid enough and I see no reason to get the T series over this,0.182,0.105,0.713,0.8847,Positive

Proddatur Naga Venkata Shravan heat management is more like okay Blowing out hot air on the display is questionable and doesn39t let the heat get away quickly Under constant load like 100 CPU running 247 it stabilizes at 15W at 65C 26C room temp in Balanced mode or 22W at 80 C in Performance mode and everything gets pretty hot BUT with a good laptop cooling pad it manages to maintain 20W at 66C in Balanced or 28W at 78C in Performance mode So it39s okay but it39s not quite  a workstation that can run for days at max frequencies without getting even remotely hotbrBottom of mine is made of aluminum so it probably acts like a heatsink too,0.141,0.013,0.847,0.9348,Positive

So Im going to close out the task manager  and for every laptop I like to use PC mark ten,0.122,0.0,0.878,0.3612,Positive
and run three performance tests Now the first  one is all about the modern office battery life,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

have that much better im thinking this,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
is really nice compared to even to the t,0.306,0.0,0.694,0.4754,Positive
series as well so and as the top while,0.358,0.0,0.642,0.4404,Positive
its got a little bit of bezel but not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
crazy i would call this,0.0,0.444,0.556,-0.34,Negative
probably,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

to see theyve also included that in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there now as for the display wise it is,0.279,0.0,0.721,0.4767,Positive
this one doesnt have of course no touch,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
uh but its got a very matte feel look,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to it as well so its not a glossy one,0.208,0.0,0.792,0.2732,Positive
its a matte look too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and that is a sixteen by nine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for the rec,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ratio so im going to quickly go through,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the setup and i do want to fire up the,0.121,0.224,0.654,-0.2732,Negative

flipping this computer around it says,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
audio by harman so it actually has a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit of oomph here for the sound,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

the t series uh theyre not up at the x,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
series level yet but theyre better than,0.391,0.0,0.609,0.5927,Positive
the t series and the p series as well so,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
that is very surprising for coming,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.3384,Positive
straight from uh entry model which is,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
the e series so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i am very impressed with the audio here,0.361,0.0,0.639,0.5256,Positive

one is which is full hd thats kind of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

especially in daylight and stuff like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
that so uh for like coffee sort of dates,0.257,0.0,0.743,0.4144,Positive

really good but more on that later what,0.23,0.0,0.77,0.2724,Positive
well do is well have a little bit of a,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.4939,Positive
peek of the internals a little bit later,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in the video so stick around for that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and well also look at the temperatures,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
and fan noise of this computer as well,0.423,0.0,0.577,0.5267,Positive
as its features as well now i will be,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
putting timestamps along this video so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can actually skip to the different,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sections that you might be interested in,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
lets have a look at the ports starting,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the left hand side of the computer,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
weve got the usbc port which is usb 32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gen2 now this supports power delivery so,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.4357,Positive
thats where you actually plug in the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
power adapter and you also plug in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
docking stations as well,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.2732,Positive
and then weve got the usb type a port,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats usb 32 gen1 and the supports,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
power sharing as well and then weve got,0.45,0.0,0.55,0.5994,Positive

system here and then weve got the usb,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
type a port which is usb 32 gen1 port,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what this computer can be configured,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with now this is the amd version so we,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just go through the amd processor so it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can be configured with either the ryzen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
3 which runs off four cores or the ryzen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
5 which this one is and that is six,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cores and theres also the ryzen 7 as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
well which runs off eight cores now as,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
for ram rise it can go up to a maximum,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
capacity of 24 gigs of ram so you can go,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
up to eight gigs soldered to the system,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
board and then theres a dimm slot for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
16 gigs now my advice is for the ram is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to if you really do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
do a bit of 3d graphics is to make sure,0.223,0.0,0.777,0.3182,Positive
youve got dual channel so you get half,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of it on the system board and the other,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
half on the dim slot and you will find,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the actual 3d graphics is greatly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
improved nearly double the performance,0.437,0.0,0.563,0.4767,Positive
so definitely look into that when you,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4576,Positive
get this computer configured with as for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
storage wise its got two slots for m2,0.307,0.0,0.693,0.4767,Positive
so you can put two ssd hard drives in,0.0,0.149,0.851,-0.1027,Negative
there and as for the graphics its of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
course using integrated graphics and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this one is the amd radon graphics and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dont be surprised it is actually pretty,0.324,0.169,0.507,0.3682,Positive
decent and as for the display wise there,0.307,0.0,0.693,0.4767,Positive
are actually two options for displays,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for this one here and they both are full,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hd options and of course there are no,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
touch as well and there are two,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
different panel types now the tn panel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
type it is graded to 220 nits of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brightness and then there is a wva,0.342,0.0,0.658,0.3818,Positive
version which is rated to 250 nits of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brightness which is what ive got right,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
here and well have a little bit,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
check on the display panel a little bit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
later in the video and youll find,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres a very interesting thing about,0.428,0.0,0.572,0.4576,Positive
the display panel especially when its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on battery the computer does come with a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
720p webcam and there are two versions,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of it this one here is just a normal,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
720p webcam and youll see theres a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
privacy shutter so its just made a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little flick of a switch and youll see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a physical shutter go over it and pretty,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
much it will just cover the webcam so if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it actually turns on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you cant really see anything which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great the other version is the ir,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.6249,Positive
version and thats really good for if,0.347,0.0,0.653,0.4927,Positive
youre using windows hello this is a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
recording from the 720p webcam from the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
e14 now this is the video and audio and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

this room which is the ambient light now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im going to turn off my studio light so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can see what it looks like with just,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
the ambient light,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and pretty much ive got two down lights,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
in front of me ive got two down lights,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
behind me and the two downloads in front,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of me is quite far away so theres,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually not much light hitting my basic,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mode so this is kind of like very dark,0.216,0.0,0.784,0.2975,Positive
now in an office environment you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
probably get a little bit better,0.396,0.0,0.604,0.3862,Positive
lighting than what ive got at the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
moment so this is kind of what it looks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like and ill just turn my studio light,0.221,0.248,0.531,-0.0772,Negative
back on so you can see what it looks,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like and of course with better lighting,0.519,0.0,0.481,0.6597,Positive

only mechanical at the bottom here so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can still depress it at the bottom,0.0,0.314,0.686,-0.4939,Negative
here now there is a fingerprint scanner,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
built into the power button and you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

with a nice little led glow so thats,0.318,0.0,0.682,0.4215,Positive
kind of nice so its not that crazy,0.446,0.0,0.554,0.5908,Positive
distracting and also the keyboard is,0.0,0.306,0.694,-0.296,Negative

spacebar will activate the three,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
different modes off medium and high and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

computer here now the top of the display,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
the lid here is made of aluminium and as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for the bottom and the sides it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty much plastic all the way through,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive

not much flex there involved as well and,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
as for the keyboard its actually quite,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
stiff here so definitely good good,0.766,0.0,0.234,0.8704,Positive

bit when you had it on a maximum volume,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but it was it was actually quite,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
balanced and had a pretty good acoustic,0.604,0.0,0.396,0.7269,Positive
com surprising from two little small,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive

issue and i thought i might just give,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you a heads up on this and that is when,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i this computer goes into hibernation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
mode it actually wont be able to wake,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it itself up it seems to have an issue,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with that so you might need to actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
turn off the hibernation of this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
computer and i have reported to lenovo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hopefully theyll actually,0.574,0.0,0.426,0.4019,Positive
put a bias update and then well,0.28,0.187,0.533,0.1779,Positive
actually have that fixed so hopefully,0.411,0.0,0.589,0.541,Positive
ill come out soon but just for those,0.0,0.213,0.787,-0.2263,Negative
who are actually purchasing very soon or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now uh you might actually want to turn,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
off that hibernation feature which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
basically deep sleep um you might,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually find that very have issues,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
trying itself waking itself up and if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you do pretty much just hold down the,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
power key into about five or ten seconds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it will actually completely kill off and,0.0,0.454,0.546,-0.7178,Negative
then you can start it up again i just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
want to give you a heads up on that,0.157,0.0,0.843,0.0772,Positive
thats all the weight of the lenovo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thinkpad e14 gen 2 is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
158 kilos add in the 65 watt power,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
adapter becomes a total weight of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
195 kilos,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when i tested out the temperatures and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fan noise of this computer when i put,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
this computer on load i found most of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the hottest area of the computer is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
located near the center of the keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sitting around with the y key and also,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the top right of the computer as well,0.358,0.0,0.642,0.4404,Positive
around about where the home key is and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats unsurprising thats where the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
exhaust fence is now from my unboxing,0.0,0.268,0.732,-0.296,Negative
video i saw the other vent on the left,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hand side of the computer and that was,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
the inlet vent so it is pretty much,0.331,0.0,0.669,0.5367,Positive
where it starts to suck in the air so,0.0,0.266,0.734,-0.4404,Negative
youll find also in the measurement its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not as hot there as well but as the,0.162,0.0,0.838,0.1406,Positive
center of the keyboard youll find even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then its not that crazy hot so it was,0.203,0.0,0.797,0.2584,Positive
actually quite hard to actually,0.0,0.297,0.703,-0.1761,Negative
differentiate which ones was going to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the hottest area now when i performed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the measurements my ambient temperature,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was 22 degrees celsius and i took my,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
base measurement when the computer is on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
idle and the hottest area of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard measured in at 31 degrees,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
celsius and the fan noise was 31,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
decibels so thats pretty much quiet and,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.539,Positive
thats pretty much cold as well and then,0.469,0.0,0.531,0.6486,Positive
i put the computer on 20 percent load,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and again the hottest area of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard measured in a peak of 31,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
degrees celsius and the fan noise was,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
still at 31 decibels so pretty much it,0.37,0.0,0.63,0.6269,Positive
hasnt really done very much at all so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it still kept itself quiet which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
great and then i put the computer on 50,0.369,0.0,0.631,0.6249,Positive
load and the hottest area of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard measured in at 37 degrees,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
celsius and as for the fan noise and,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
measured in a maximum of 32 decibels so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
still quite quiet but its spun up a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
little bit its quite quiet still and as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for the temperature you dont really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feel that much and then i put the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
computer on a hundred percent load and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the hottest area of the keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
measured in at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
425 degrees celsius and the fan noise,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
measured in a maximum of 33 decibels so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
still quite quiet surprisingly and then,0.331,0.0,0.669,0.3566,Positive
i also measured the bottom back cover of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the computer and the hottest area,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
measured in at 41 degrees celsius but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
most of the areas was around about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hottest areas about 40 degrees celsius,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and of course the fan noise was 33,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
decibels so as you can see this computer,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is not hot at all even on most of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
time when youre doing average juice up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to 50 its not that hot neither at all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can and even 100 you can quite,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
happily put your hand down you feel a,0.576,0.0,0.424,0.7783,Positive
little warm and thats about it its not,0.187,0.0,0.813,0.1548,Positive
that hot at all its not burning hot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this for once is a very very cool,0.324,0.0,0.676,0.4351,Positive
computer when youre actually working on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
even though at measuring at 41 degrees,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
celsius you can probably put this on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your lap but i still wouldnt advise you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to put this on the lap but you probably,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
couldnt wouldnt feel too,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
distressed from it it will feel a little,0.0,0.318,0.682,-0.4215,Negative
bit warm but not too distressed where it,0.426,0.0,0.574,0.5343,Positive
actually will be burning you so thats a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bit of a surprise how well the,0.512,0.0,0.488,0.4939,Positive
temperatures are on this ryzen 5 version,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of this computer i am very impressed by,0.361,0.0,0.639,0.5256,Positive
that lets have a look at the internals,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
first off you need to unscrew the seven,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
screws thats holding the back cover in,0.0,0.25,0.75,-0.25,Negative
after that you need a tool to pry this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thing open now this is not an easy job,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.3412,Negative
this one im just using my daughters,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
playdoh sculpture tool seems to work,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
very well for this hopefully later on,0.505,0.0,0.495,0.624,Positive
ill upgrade it but my advice is to,0.0,0.213,0.787,-0.2263,Negative
actually come bring from the corners and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then go slowly slice it down to on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
front and then on the corner slowly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slice it through the sides as well and,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
then just repeat this again from the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
other side so slowly from the corner,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slowly slice it from the front and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slowly slice it from the back and then,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
after you should be able to lift this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
open now ive actually pre undone this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to speed up some time and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is what the internals kind of look,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like now,0.714,0.0,0.286,0.3612,Positive
we can straight away see weve got the,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
45 watt hour battery and to actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
undo the battery its held in by,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
five screws here and this is the little,0.0,0.222,0.778,-0.25,Negative
tab you can pretty much,0.444,0.0,0.556,0.4939,Positive
pull it down,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then you should be able to lift this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thing up so thats kind of what you see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then weve got the coin battery right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
here but you dont need to actually undo,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that you can pretty much undo it from,0.314,0.0,0.686,0.4939,Positive
here if need be so ill just put this,0.0,0.311,0.689,-0.5598,Negative
one back in here place here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
straight away this is the first slot of,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
ssd hard drive here so m2 and then this,0.0,0.149,0.851,-0.1027,Negative
there is the second ssd hard drive which,0.0,0.167,0.833,-0.1027,Negative
is the other m2 that so you got two to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually work off because this ones,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
only for the smaller ones and this ones,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for the larger ones here and then weve,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
got the wifi card here and right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
underneath this heat shield,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is im just pry it open ready and is,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
where the sol dim slot is for the ram,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
upgrades thats pretty much all there is,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
to internals as the display panel is a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
16 by 9 aspect ratio and as for the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
finish of the display panel it is an,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
antiglare,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feel to the display panel so its not a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
glossy one its one of those matte feel,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as for the bezel wise youll see its,0.307,0.0,0.693,0.4767,Positive
actually i would say medium narrow its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not crazy narrow all the way through but,0.178,0.0,0.822,0.1326,Positive
it is nice and narrow in the sides and,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.4215,Positive
as from the top and bottom its decently,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
narrow enough but its not like super,0.0,0.579,0.421,-0.7835,Negative
thick neither and its not super thin,0.0,0.344,0.656,-0.4847,Negative
like some of the other,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
computers around testing out the color,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gamut coverage or the full hd 250 nit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
display it measured in at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
564 percent srgb coverage and 39,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
adobe rgb coverage and 40,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dci p3 coverage,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i found a very interesting thing while i,0.428,0.0,0.572,0.4576,Positive
was testing out the brightness of the,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
display panel and that is when this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
computer is on battery it will limit the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brightness of the display panel now at,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
the moment its running on battery and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ive got it at its maximum brightness,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
and it is only going up to a maximum of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
88 candidates per square meter which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
88 nits of brightness now just to show,0.271,0.0,0.729,0.3818,Positive
you its actually reading from that im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just going to pull this off so you can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
see that current change and ill just,0.0,0.318,0.682,-0.4215,Negative
put it back on so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just slowly put that back on properly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and its going to read around about 88,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to 89 handler per screen area so when i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
plug the power back in and youll see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im not going to change any things at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all im just going to plug it back in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and youll slowly see this will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
automatically ram itself back up to its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
rated knitted rice now this ones rated,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to 250 nits of brightness as you can see,0.245,0.0,0.755,0.3818,Positive
this just slowly bring itself up to the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
brightness,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3818,Positive
for it and youll go past hopefully,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
about 250 i know its gone past 250 its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
up to 276,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
candles per screen or 275 candidate per,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
screen which is a 275 digit brown so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ive got an extra 25 nits of bronze,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fantastic,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5574,Positive
but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it will be on power and then once i just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
take this off power to pull the power,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cable and youll see it actually,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
automatically ramp itself back down to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
88 nits of brightness at its maximum,0.302,0.0,0.698,0.3818,Positive
ive shined lights over it just to see,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if theres any sort of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thing to do with ambient light but no it,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.4215,Negative
doesnt really change that maximum,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
looking goal on battery is 88 knits or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
89 nits of brightness so this is a bit,0.271,0.0,0.729,0.3818,Positive
of a worry when youre actually out and,0.0,0.326,0.674,-0.4404,Negative
about and especially in daylight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it wont be a very bright screen at all,0.0,0.273,0.727,-0.3865,Negative
so hopefully well find some,0.642,0.0,0.358,0.6566,Positive
information from lenovo to see if we can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
actually get this thing changed i did,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

doesnt have that extra punch that some,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gloss gives you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
however what you do get is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a sort of more uniform experience,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

now for productivity tasks thats not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
really a big deal,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that audience tends to like a slightly,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
taller display because of the type of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
content that you view like say websites,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive

can hold it out here i cant tell you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for days quantities that are left,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because so many of them you have uh four,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
separate speakers so you have speakers,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
here which are going to give you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh sort of more detail for dialogue,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
firing into your left and right ear and,0.0,0.255,0.745,-0.34,Negative
then for a little extra bass these two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

honestly for a 199 pound laptop,0.429,0.0,0.571,0.4588,Positive
im going to take that sound im going,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to say it right now this sounds better,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
than some laptops ive tested that are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quite a bit bigger so they did think,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
about sound and i appreciate that,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
because for a while lenovo wasnt all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that interested in delivering too much,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
sound to you because they thought okay,0.241,0.0,0.759,0.2263,Positive
this is a work device take it easy you,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive

with this laptop windows hello tons of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

often for a sort of noise cancellation,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
functionality in order to determine,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what frequency the background noise is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and to kind of attempt to get rid of it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

this is where it should be up on the top,0.167,0.0,0.833,0.2023,Positive
of the display the quick brown,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fox the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
quick one of the things about a laptop,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its not just the travel in the keys but,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its also whether or not the whole thing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
flexes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
as those keys travel downwards and often,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
when youre dealing with something so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lightweight its tough for them to,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.128,Negative
figure out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a way in which to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
deter,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the chassis from,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
bending down,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one of the ways that lenovo does it with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the thinkpad lineup is they use some,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
exotic materials like carbon and,0.385,0.0,0.615,0.3612,Positive
magnesium and a variety of highend,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
materials that are super lightweight but,0.329,0.0,0.671,0.3506,Positive
also stiff and strong and so as you can,0.292,0.0,0.708,0.5106,Positive
see even though this thing is not even,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
two pounds as i quick brown fox it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres no im not completely i mean,0.0,0.306,0.694,-0.296,Negative
theres a little bit of flex in there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but its nothing substantial now you,0.0,0.274,0.726,-0.2235,Negative
also know that im a huge fan of,0.479,0.0,0.521,0.5574,Positive
thunderbolt seeing as how with a thin,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and light laptop sometimes its not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to be the most,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
overpowering thing from a graphics,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
performance perspective but when you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have thunderbolt 4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
my goodness you got a lot of potential,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4588,Positive
expandability with tremendous throughput,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you could get crazy and do some egpu,0.0,0.255,0.745,-0.34,Negative
stuff if you wanted you could get crazy,0.0,0.255,0.745,-0.34,Negative
and do some capture stuff if you wanted,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so theres flexibility once you have,0.349,0.0,0.651,0.3976,Positive
that port and believe it or not its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kind of a tough port to find every time,0.0,0.176,0.824,-0.128,Negative
on every laptop you might happen to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
looking at,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is way heavier all right i grabbed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
some comparables because i this is just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its so interesting to me,0.428,0.0,0.572,0.4576,Positive
sort of what the ultimate computing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
device is gonna be just in my life and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its gonna be different for everyone,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
depending on what you do on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
daytoday for me the daytoday theres,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
email,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres of course i gotta get into slack,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and see what everybodys talking about,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theres some youtube theres a lot of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tagging different things and uploading,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
things im just interacting with a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard a lot i need a nice screen and,0.359,0.0,0.641,0.4215,Positive
i want something ultra portable and,0.245,0.0,0.755,0.0772,Positive
relatively durable so now you know why,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
im such a fan of these things but for,0.191,0.0,0.809,0.1655,Positive
some people that are in this market,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
theyre going to cross shop it against,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
something like this which is a macbook,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
air but funny enough the macbook air,0.391,0.0,0.609,0.5927,Positive
actually feels heavy next to this its a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whole pound heavier how crazy is that,0.0,0.286,0.714,-0.34,Negative
its a 13 inch laptop its a whole pound,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heavier now granted its different,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.25,Positive
materials this is using an aluminum body,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so it kind of has a its very own,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
luxurious feel to it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and theres a much bigger bezel around,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the display its a glossy display the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
keyboard is a totally different type of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
setup as well bigger track pad theyre,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2732,Positive
targeted maybe at different individuals,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but i could imagine that cross shop and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in that case,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if youre looking for an ultra portable,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i have to imagine youre looking at that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
weight if its going to go in a backpack,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if its going to move around with you an,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
extra pound,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its uh,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know this is twothirds the weight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of this its quite substantial and then,0.259,0.0,0.741,0.2716,Positive
the other crazy thing is once you get,0.0,0.255,0.745,-0.34,Negative
into,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
an ipad setup this is a 129 inch ipad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pro with the keyboard attachment and,0.306,0.0,0.694,0.296,Positive
obviously this is a more versatile,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
device because i can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pull this off put it back on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
have the magic keyboard attachment,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.296,Positive
to do my typing and touch screen and i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
could have a pen with it as well but,0.181,0.0,0.819,0.1406,Positive
its kind of amazing how heavy this all,0.334,0.0,0.666,0.5434,Positive
gets when you put it all together so the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ipad on its own,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is 14 pound,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is 14 pounds this is 199 pounds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the difference between this and the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook air is a pound the difference,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
between these two items,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is about half a pound point six pounds,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
put that in perspective,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because you cant feel this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats insane,0.0,0.73,0.27,-0.4019,Negative
imagine its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slightly heavier than a 129 inch ipad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pro with an entire keyboard and then if,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you want to attach the ipad pro to the,0.14,0.0,0.86,0.0772,Positive
keyboard and have a allinone solution,0.365,0.0,0.635,0.3182,Positive
for when you need to do some typing let,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
me see how much the magic keyboard ways,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
macbook air is 1290 grams and this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
combined weight is 1351,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this package is more than a pound,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heavier than this one and you end up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with a 13inch display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a keyboard in this case you can also get,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a touch display i realize theyre very,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
different targeted differently this is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
like sort of a mobile os with the,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
potential for pen input and so on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so its going to depend on what type of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
work you do but for me thats just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
staggering,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what they were able to pack in here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
at this weight and im very excited to,0.278,0.0,0.722,0.4005,Positive
use this more extensively youre going,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to see it on my desk downstairs on the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
loo later set and im going to be going,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
back and forth with this this will be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the daily and im gonna hardly notice,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that im carrying it and also last thing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i just noticed theres the sim card tray,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so yeah crazy 199 pound thinkpad x1,0.245,0.263,0.492,-0.0478,Neutral
nano,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
look at this look a few of these two,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this thing feels like a tank oh thats,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
ridiculous,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.3612,Negative
oh my god i know im throwing this thing,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
i know its crazy,0.0,0.545,0.455,-0.34,Negative
yeah thats nuts,0.4,0.418,0.182,-0.0258,Neutral
yeah you really feel like you want to,0.557,0.0,0.443,0.6461,Positive
get up and move go to a different spot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
go to the kitchen go to the especially,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with that little charger,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you could do anything you go anywhere,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can do anything,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hello everyone and welcome back to,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.4588,Positive
another episode of gizmo joe today were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh looking at a lenovo thinkpad e14 gen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
3 now i know and i apologize that this,0.219,0.0,0.781,0.1027,Positive
is a bit hard to see um i dont have my,0.0,0.149,0.851,-0.1027,Negative
standard tripod handy because im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
visiting my parents in the states,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so just bear with me but basically what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were going to do today is were going,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to essentially upgrade the ram and put,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
another solid state drive in here so,0.211,0.0,0.789,0.1531,Positive
basically,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you can get this in a variety of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
different configurations this is the amd,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ryzen 5,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but it only has 8 gigabytes of ram and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its only got a 256 gigabyte solid state,0.211,0.0,0.789,0.1531,Positive
drive on the inside now obviously you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
can pay more to have 16 gigabytes or,0.0,0.167,0.833,-0.1027,Negative
whatever,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but i chose not to do that because it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sort of expensive to do those upgrades,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
direct from lenovo and i said to myself,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know what i can,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
probably just upgrade that stuff myself,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
save myself a little bit of cash so,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
thats what were going to do,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we have an 8 gigabyte ram module,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thats ddr4 obviously its a sodium,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because its a laptop and were going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
be installing that to bump up the ram,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
from 8 on the inside of this device to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
16 total and then were also going to be,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
taking this m2 drive which is a one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
terabyte micron drive and installing,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that as well so were going to leave the,0.204,0.117,0.68,0.2263,Positive
256 in there but its got a separate,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slot somewhere around here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
another solid state drive which is what,0.211,0.0,0.789,0.1531,Positive
were gonna do and were gonna just use,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that one for storage so what we need to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
do is uh there are a bunch of screws,0.0,0.222,0.778,-0.25,Negative
theres one here one here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and one here one here one here one here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so its about uh seven screws total and,0.0,0.222,0.778,-0.25,Negative
were gonna remove those screws and then,0.0,0.25,0.75,-0.25,Negative
were basically gonna pry this back,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
panel off now from what i understand and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
from what ive seen sort of uh,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know red on reddit and forums and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whatnot is that there are sort of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
latches that keep this back panel down,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so even when you take the screws out it,0.0,0.2,0.8,-0.25,Negative
wants to stay together,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so you just have to take a little bit of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
time to pry that off so thats what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were going to do im going to grab a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
screwdriver were going to undo these,0.206,0.0,0.794,0.0772,Positive
screws and were going to try to peel,0.0,0.222,0.778,-0.25,Negative
this back panel off and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
hopefully it will be all right,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
okay so once you remove the seven screws,0.192,0.202,0.606,-0.0258,Neutral
on the back panel what youre going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
want to do is youre going to want to,0.271,0.0,0.729,0.1531,Positive
find,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the little seam which is right here i,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
know its really really hard to see,0.0,0.247,0.753,-0.2433,Negative
but basically what youre going to do is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
youre going to basically pry this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
corner up now i could get my fingernail,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
in there i dont have very long,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fingernails but i could get it in there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and manage to pry it up and then what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you want to do is you want to carefully,0.406,0.0,0.594,0.2732,Positive
work your way around just peeling that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
back housing off of or the back plate,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
off of this sort of like housing here,0.24,0.0,0.76,0.2975,Positive
going to be really really careful,0.303,0.0,0.697,0.2895,Positive
because there are sort of plastic,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
latches on the inside here that will,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
catch so what i recommend is getting,0.357,0.0,0.643,0.4173,Positive
yourself like a little plastic shim uh,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
and then using that to sort of pry it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
open and just carefully work your way,0.2,0.0,0.8,0.128,Positive
around the entire unit and then the back,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
plate should just peel right off and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then well be able to do our upgrade,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2732,Positive
okay so now we have the back panel of,0.192,0.0,0.808,0.2263,Positive
the thinkpad e14 gen 3 off now like i,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive
said you have to be really really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
careful because there are sort of like,0.432,0.0,0.568,0.4228,Positive
clips that hold the back plate in place,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just carefully work your way around find,0.2,0.0,0.8,0.128,Positive
a corner that kind of you can peel up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with your fingernail or something like,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
that get a bit of plastic and just work,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
your way around and eventually the back,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
plate will come off i will say though,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that it is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tedious it does take a little while um,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know it does feel like you need to,0.238,0.0,0.762,0.3612,Positive
force it a little bit but trust me if,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.6192,Positive
you just keep uh working at it going,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around it will eventually come off so,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
basically what were looking at here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is right here is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the solidstate drive where the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
operating system is stored like i said,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
mines a 256 but right over here is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
where we can install our,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
m2,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
2280,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
drive so thats basically just going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slot in right there and ill do that in,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.4215,Negative
a second but what i want to show you,0.195,0.0,0.805,0.1154,Positive
first is under this sort of aluminum,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heat shield here we can pry this up,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because this is where the ram is so what,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were going to do is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were going to essentially pull this off,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and once i do ill show you and well,0.193,0.257,0.55,-0.1779,Negative
install our new ram module okay so as i,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
mentioned before you basically take this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heat shield off you can its its not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
screwed down or anything like that its,0.234,0.299,0.467,-0.1779,Negative
just basically held down by,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
these little pins here you can just you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
know if you can get your fingernail,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
underneath there it should pop right off,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
otherwise like i said you can use a,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.3612,Positive
little bit of plastic to essentially pry,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that up but as you can see theres eight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gigabytes uh soldered onto the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
motherboard but we do have an empty slot,0.0,0.239,0.761,-0.296,Negative
so thats what were gonna do were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to grab 8 gigabytes of ddr4,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ram this is 3200,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
megahertz which is exactly the same as,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
whats going on there so again you know,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ryzens they benefit from more ram and,0.333,0.0,0.667,0.4588,Positive
thats obviously best to have them sort,0.412,0.0,0.588,0.6369,Positive
of in dual channel mode so hopefully,0.368,0.0,0.632,0.541,Positive
this will give us a nice little,0.359,0.0,0.641,0.4215,Positive
performance boost now i have crucial,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
here i bought this off of amazon it was,0.195,0.0,0.805,0.1779,Positive
pretty cheap i think it was only about,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
35 us bucks or something like that if i,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
can get it open i can show you how to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
install this thing its not terribly,0.369,0.0,0.631,0.4449,Positive
difficult but basically we just take,0.0,0.259,0.741,-0.1901,Negative
this guy out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if i can get him out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and thats our little ram module and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what were going to do is were just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to flip it around so obviously,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its asymmetric the pins here so you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
cant put it in,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
you know one way or the other it only,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
goes in a particular way and basically,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were just going to slot it in right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
there,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
make sure its seated properly push down,0.277,0.0,0.723,0.3182,Positive
and these two clips will snap in place,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and that means that your ram is now,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seated properly so what weve done is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
weve taken an 8 gigabyte,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to a 16 gigabyte and that should really,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
help with performance anyway lets move,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
over to the solid state drive,0.242,0.0,0.758,0.1531,Positive
installation next okay so as i mentioned,0.275,0.0,0.725,0.2263,Positive
before as you can see ive popped that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
heat shield back on but as i said before,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
this is where our m2 drive is going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
be so again this particular laptop its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the e14 gen 3 comes with 256 gigabytes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
uh preinstalled but what were going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
do is were going to expand that storage,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
space by popping in one of these guys,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and thats just an m2 drive and like i,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
said this ones a one terabyte its a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
micron,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and yeah it will give us a decent amount,0.239,0.0,0.761,0.296,Positive
of space so if youve never installed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one of these before basically they kind,0.362,0.0,0.638,0.5267,Positive
of look like a stick of gum or something,0.263,0.0,0.737,0.3612,Positive
like that but you need to essentially,0.226,0.0,0.774,0.1901,Positive
undo this screw here,0.0,0.318,0.682,-0.1027,Negative
which is what were going to do right,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
now were going to pop that out,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pop that off to the side dont lose that,0.22,0.0,0.78,0.3089,Positive
because we definitely need that screw,0.333,0.173,0.494,0.3182,Positive
right and then what were going to do is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
were going to take this guy and we are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
just going to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
slot him in right here,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so press in firmly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it should see okay,0.388,0.0,0.612,0.2263,Positive
and then that screw that we unscrewed,0.0,0.189,0.811,-0.1027,Negative
before were going to pop it right back,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because thats whats going to hold this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
drive in place make sure it doesnt move,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
around,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and if i can screw it in,0.0,0.219,0.781,-0.1027,Negative
and there you go so its seated properly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
its not going anywhere now what were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to do is were going to put that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
back,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
panel back on and then fire this guy up,0.0,0.231,0.769,-0.34,Negative
and we can format our drive and were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to double check and make sure that,0.247,0.0,0.753,0.3182,Positive
you know its reading the 16 gigabytes,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ram as opposed to eight anyway stay,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
tuned,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
okay so i fired up my laptop it turned,0.161,0.33,0.509,-0.4576,Negative
on so thats a good sign and i know its,0.312,0.0,0.688,0.4902,Positive
a little hard to see but basically you,0.0,0.149,0.851,-0.0138,Neutral
can see here in the about section of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with the windows settings is that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
obviously its recognizing that i have,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
an amd ryzen 5 5500u with the radeon,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
graphics and we now have 16 gigabytes of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ram it says 48 of that is usable thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pretty typical,0.762,0.0,0.238,0.4939,Positive
so obviously it is recognizing that ram,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
module and were good to go now what,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
were going to do next is just check and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
see if its recognizing that other,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
1 terabyte drive and so as i said before,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
my c drive thats where the windows,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
installation is and basically,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
we have if i hit properties here were,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
looking at a 237 so again like a 256,0.317,0.0,0.683,0.4173,Positive
gigabyte solid state drive,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.1531,Positive
ive used about 70 gigs ive got 166,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
left over now that one terabyte drive,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that i put in was actually from another,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
laptop so it also had another,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
build of windows on there which im,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
going to wipe out and just totally clear,0.292,0.0,0.708,0.4391,Positive
off,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but for right now as you can see its,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
showing as the d drive the other,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
solid state drive that we just installed,0.211,0.0,0.789,0.1531,Positive
and as you can see here its a one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
terabyte so were looking at 931,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gigabytes so again everything has,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
gone smoothly,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
all you need to do is just take your,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
time peeling that back panel off and you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
should be good to go you can upgrade,0.293,0.0,0.707,0.4404,Positive
your ram and you can pop in more storage,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
to put,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the back panel back on just you know,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
again set it on and then just snap it,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
closed,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then put those screws back in and,0.0,0.222,0.778,-0.25,Negative
you should be ready to roll anyway,0.294,0.0,0.706,0.3612,Positive

amd,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ryzen 4000 and make no mistake,0.0,0.535,0.465,-0.5574,Negative
this is not just another variation of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the intel model,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but a completely new version the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
thinkpad e14,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
generation 2 so it now comes with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
support for dual channel memory,0.403,0.0,0.597,0.4019,Positive
a backless keyboard although optional,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
for some markets,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and a second m2 slot instead of the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
rather space,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
eating 25 inch cage from before,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so that sounds like some steps in the,0.283,0.0,0.717,0.4144,Positive
right direction,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but before we get into it weve got to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
unbox the damn thing,0.0,0.474,0.526,-0.4019,Negative
all right lets talk build quality,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so its the cheapest thing pad and that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
immediately comes with some downsides,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
but in my opinion there isnt a lot that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
i can truly complain,0.453,0.391,0.156,0.1027,Positive
about with this device its made out of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
aluminium,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and abs plastic so it feels solid,0.237,0.0,0.763,0.2177,Positive
but with the hinge you want to make sure,0.386,0.0,0.614,0.5267,Positive
you got both hands available,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
because you cant open this laptop with,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one hand and holding a camera at the,0.348,0.0,0.652,0.4939,Positive
same time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
well it requires three hands so,0.296,0.0,0.704,0.2732,Positive
this thinkpad e14 gen 2 packs the 8 core,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ryzen 7 with integrated graphics in you,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the screen has very small bezels all,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
around,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
while the top and bottom one are,0.231,0.0,0.769,0.2023,Positive
slightly chunkier,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the reason being that up top weve got,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
the web camera with ir which allows for,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
windows hello,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then theres the beloved thinkpad,0.452,0.0,0.548,0.5106,Positive
keyboard which still feels amazing to,0.432,0.0,0.568,0.5859,Positive

the trackpad is unfortunately not very,0.0,0.324,0.676,-0.34,Negative
good though by todays standard status,0.367,0.0,0.633,0.4404,Positive
okay so now were going to know the,0.213,0.0,0.787,0.2263,Positive
laptop a bit with some first impressions,0.275,0.0,0.725,0.2263,Positive
but to really get to know it we need to,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
dive deeper,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Music,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lets start with going over the,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
internals,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so were rocking the amd ryzen 7 4700u,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
processor with integrated graphics that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
means,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
eight cores eight threads two gigahertz,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
base clock,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
up to 41 gigahertz max boost clock,0.31,0.0,0.69,0.4019,Positive
which is quite impressive,0.545,0.0,0.455,0.5563,Positive
we got 8 gigs of ram its ddr4 and is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
running at 3200 megahertz,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
weve also got one empty sodium slot so,0.0,0.205,0.795,-0.2023,Negative
you can have up to 24 gigs,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
of ram in dual channel storage wise,0.341,0.0,0.659,0.4767,Positive
we have the first hard drive which is a,0.0,0.167,0.833,-0.1027,Negative
512 gig,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
pcie m2 plus weve got an empty m2,0.0,0.205,0.795,-0.2023,Negative
slot if you want to expand,0.474,0.0,0.526,0.3818,Positive
the battery is a 45 watt hour,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so its decent size charged at 65 watts,0.0,0.205,0.795,-0.2023,Negative
which allows for 80 in just,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
one hour via usbc,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
the claimed battery life is 107 hours,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so i would expect some around six or,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
seven and all of this is running on,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
windows 10 pro so thats,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
nice and to top it off weve got the,0.397,0.0,0.603,0.5574,Positive
display,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so this one is a 14 inch,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
full hd ips,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
with antiglare and a brightness of,0.394,0.0,0.606,0.3818,Positive
250 nits which is,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
honestly not that great but,0.28,0.3,0.42,-0.0379,Neutral
it works fine for me in terms of,0.205,0.0,0.795,0.2023,Positive
ports weve got one usb 32,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
typec generation one with the function,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

microphone jack,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
on the other side we got one usb 20,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
a flippy down ethernet port and a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
kensington lock,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
simple as that,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
lets move on to everyday usability,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
everyday tasks such as browsing reddit,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and watching video,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
feel incredibly snappy thanks to the,0.389,0.0,0.611,0.4902,Positive
high boost clock of a ryzen 7 processor,0.351,0.0,0.649,0.4019,Positive
the display gets both bright and dim,0.326,0.0,0.674,0.4404,Positive
enough for most environments,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
except for maybe being outside in direct,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
sunlight,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
if you feel the urge to furiously type a,0.0,0.293,0.707,-0.4404,Negative
notepad,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
or maybe not but perhaps compose a,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
document in word or google docs,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
then i can happily report that this,0.419,0.0,0.581,0.5574,Positive
keyboard still,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
is the best on the market for long,0.375,0.0,0.625,0.6369,Positive
typing session,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and then theres the webcam and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
microphone,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and they are,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
less than average and average,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
by todays standards is still terribly,0.0,0.419,0.581,-0.5574,Negative
low,0.0,1.0,0.0,-0.2732,Negative
so you wont be taking any,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
fancy meetings with this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
setting up the laptop for the first time,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
was rather quick and simple,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
it was not running a recent version of,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

moving on to gaming even though this,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

87 fps on pretty high settings,0.39,0.0,0.61,0.4939,Positive
in cs go it was also very playable,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
not as high but still mentioning,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
over 70 fps at 79,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
so nearly 80 and in rocket league,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

56 fps,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral

in cinebench we can see that the 8 core,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
ryzen 7,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
beats out even desktop cpus from not,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
that long ago,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is impressive the only place we,0.355,0.0,0.645,0.5106,Positive

couple of screws to undo,0.0,0.333,0.667,-0.25,Negative
inside you can see the second m2 slot,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
which is the full size one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
under here we got the sodium slot and,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
what keeps it cool is the two heat pipes,0.223,0.0,0.777,0.3182,Positive
compared to the intel versions one,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
and for me it hasnt got uncomfortably,0.273,0.0,0.727,0.3089,Positive
hot even under low,0.0,0.412,0.588,-0.2732,Negative
