I added this to my daily routine after a bad autoimmune flare from too much sun and my doctor making it clear to me that a broad spectrum sunscreen must be a part of my daily routine  I read the reviews here and saw that some said this left a cast and some said that it cleared after the product was absorbed  I thought to myself even if it did leave a slight cast it would be okay as I am really fair skinned actually I am pretty pale  Just as some background I wear very little makeup usually just a CC Cream for foundationThis product works in providing great sun protection that does not irritate my sensitive skin and does not clog my pores  However the cast does NOT go away for me once it is absorbed so I can only imagine how it is for those with darker skin than mine  I tried using my normal CC cream over it and that just made it an even weirder cast  I am going to try the tinted one but until it arrives I will resemble Casper,0.071,0.026,0.904,0.7151,Positive
I used this on my face and neck in Floridadid not burn when applied in morning and outside all day  Did not have any reaction with my sensitive skin but did have a white sheen,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
Apparently mineral sunscreen tends to leave a white film on your face this has been my experience  I would NOT use this for professional use since there is a light white film  It seems to work well for poolbeach time and being in and out of the water  I still wear a hat and sunglasses but Im a kayaker and as Im in and out of the bay to practice kayaking skills usually without a hat and glasses it seems to protect well  I love the Cerave daily moisturizer 30 SPF  The daily moisturizer does NOT leave a residue,0.134,0.024,0.842,0.9186,Positive
The sunscreen is good but it leaves a white cast on my face Thats very noticiable,0.122,0.0,0.878,0.2382,Positive
I like the light tint and it seems to be a very good sunscreen  Suggested by my dermatologist  It is a little heavy to wash off at the end of the day But I usually have reapplied sunscreen by then as well  I also use the Sara the moisturizer with number 30 sunscreen which is clear Or just apply a little moisturizer before I use the tinted sunscreen Lots of flexibility depending what Im doing on any day and effective attractive  sunscreen,0.251,0.0,0.749,0.9659,Positive
I use this sunscreen kitesurfing in Mexico It does not wash off and I do not burn Regular sunscreen is removed by the waves and spray Also unlike the chemical sunscreens I do not taste this sunscreen after application I still use both types but if I expect to be on the water a long time this mineral based sunscreen provides the best protection,0.092,0.0,0.908,0.7783,Positive
I have hyperpigmentation on my skin and I wanted something that would protect my face and reduce the red spots I alreday have on my face I bought this product and so far I am seeing a pretty big differnce Slowly but surely I am seeing that my hyperpigmentaion is fading while reducing new acne that shows up I do have to note that the sunscreen casts a pretty pale shade on my face My skin tone is light and evn though I apply small drops of the suncreen my skin turns very whitepurple That is the only downside I have But so far it protects my skin and does the job,0.136,0.022,0.841,0.9169,Positive

Im a caramel brown black woman with oily skin and I got the suite of cerave products including the SPF 50 to reduce my darkspots Yes it has a white cast almost no matter the amt used However TIP  I mix mine with either concealer or foundation to tint it prior to applying to my face and also another layer of Cerave SPF 30 which does NOT have a white cast and is also not mineral based From there the white cast is not a problem It looks natural in photos and under makeup The most important thing to me is protection to prevent hyperpigmentation and Ive been using about 3 wks This line of products has helped more than anything else so far esp with the dark spots from shaving the little hairs at the corner of my chin  Takeaway I know ppl of color can be wary about sunscreen but make it work for you,0.051,0.017,0.932,0.5078,Positive
Its a pretty good sunscreen it doesnt stink which is a relief but it does leave a heavy white cast It can be reduced by rubbing the sunscreen between your hands for a few seconds and it isnt really an issue for me because Im very pale to begin with but may be for others,0.14,0.024,0.836,0.6629,Positive
This product has some mixed reviews and this one also is mixed Great proven protection from a very well respected company If you use too much it is difficult to spread and gives a whits tone The secret is to apply lightly and rub well into the skin Then reapply a like amount and spread again,0.23,0.039,0.731,0.9055,Positive
This sun screen really works great but the only thing that I didnt like is that is leaves a bad white cast on darker skin tones,0.086,0.238,0.675,-0.6933,Negative
Exactly what I needed for when in the sun especially with my sensitive skin With most sunscreens I breakout but not with this oneLove how light it goes on and lasts so long Great coverage,0.159,0.0,0.841,0.7945,Positive
Holy white cast I applied it on my face first and I was mortified The cast did not dissipate I had to wipe it off This is a very thick and sticky consistency The only time I can wear this is probably at the beach But not for daily under the makeup unless you want to look like Casper the ghost,0.077,0.049,0.874,0.1901,Positive
As a sunscreen this product works I did not get sunburned when I was wearing it despite being in full sun That is the only positiveThis sunscreen is difficult to apply and left a visible white cast on my already pale skin The worst part is that the lotion stays sticky and doesnt ever feel like it sinks in or dries I could not stand the stickiness and wont be using the rest of the bottle,0.0,0.114,0.886,-0.8276,Negative
Worked well for protection and didnt cause me to break out however it does not blend in at all so my face was covered in white,0.077,0.0,0.923,0.2732,Positive
If you happen to not be quite white  you may see a white sheen on your skin Trust me  it doesnt absorb and go away  The actual texture of the texture of the sunscreen is nice and not too sticky  Im sure the sunscreen is itself good quality  but I took it off before even going outside because I looked a bit sickly,0.122,0.0,0.878,0.6858,Positive
I love CeraVe products and really wanted to love this facial sunscreen I have dry skin and this is thick and made my skin even drier  Perhaps it will work on others it just didnt work for me I will keep and use it just not on my face,0.16,0.0,0.84,0.8555,Positive
Ive used many cerve products This sunscreen has titanium dioxide and zinc oxide in it Titanium dioxide normally does not work on dark skin It will either have a gray cast  In this situation  its blue So for a sunscreen  I say go for it But if youre leaving your home to go somewhere important  that would not be the day to use this If youre going to lay out on your patio or balcony then sure But not to go to a store and run errands,0.06,0.0,0.94,0.631,Positive
Was recommended by my dermatologist for facial sun exposure with roseacea Works great Much less redness after sun exposure My only complaint would be that it doesnt blend all that well and leaves a bit of a white film Not enough for me to stop using it though,0.15,0.082,0.768,0.5574,Positive
I was tired of spending 40 on other facial sunscreens so decided to give this a try Yes it does the job and provides solid protection from the sun BUT and this is a dealbreaker for me it takes forever to absorb into your face I like to put sunscreen on under my foundation every day I live in Phoenix and being in the sun is often unavoidable and even a normal dose of this makes your face completely white and ghostlike for hours So I wont be purchasing again I think this product is better served for people hanging out by the pool I wouldnt call this a daily sunscreen,0.095,0.018,0.887,0.8074,Positive
It honestly not that good for cerave products one it stinks like chemicals but it smells a lot like thread locker to me the sunscreen is thicccccc and hard to blend out but other then that its good lol,0.22,0.163,0.617,0.5842,Positive

First of all its really hard to produce an spf50 sunscreen that does not leave any white castI would not recommend this sunscreen for darker shades unless you want to look like Mark Zuckerberg surfing in Hawaii Even applying a pea sized amount of sunscreen will leave a very noticeable white cast The CeraVe spf 30 is much better for darker skin tones if you really work it in However if you have pale skin like me their spf 50 really isnt too bad Taking this into account I want to point out the positives of this sunscreen1 It does not have that think sunscreen smell It doesnt have any smell which is nice I wear sunscreen everyday of the year and it is nice to have one that does not have me smelling like a pool2 It blends in fairly nicely when your face is moisturized When I first started putting on this sunscreen I was disappointed because I have very pale skin with rosacea on my cheeks Even with my pale skin the white cast was noticeable for the rest of the day However I noticed that if my face is moisturized or even a little greasy before application It will not leave a horrible white cast3 It soothed my rosacea My face is pretty much red all the time and looks irritated after a workout However after a few weeks of using this sunscreen I noticed that my rosacea is pretty calm at the end of the day This only happens when I wear this sunscreen I am not sure if it is because of the niacinamide in this sunscreen but that was a nice surprise,0.135,0.03,0.835,0.9621,Positive

I have been using this product for my face for several years This is the one that has worked best for me giving me protection when no other product hasI see reviews that say it gives a white cast and is hard to spreadI use a tiny bit of moisturizer first and before it dries I apply the CeraveThat helps it to spread easily and absorb completelyno white cast for meIf you have dark skin you may wish to avoid products with zinc oxide,0.155,0.063,0.782,0.8591,Positive
This product works really well and spreads super easily I like the feeling of it on and it doesnt have any oily after residue My only complaint is that the white tint is pretty bad on this one It takes a while to get it in your skin enough to even leave the house,0.242,0.105,0.654,0.8399,Positive

All the chemical sunscreens seem to irritate my eyes  The zinc ones dont  This product is not that thick but it doesnt fully disappear no matter how much you work it in  There is a white sheen to my face  I also feel it doesnt really dry with a dewy feel to the skin instead of dry  Ill continue to use this until I find something better,0.142,0.077,0.781,0.5804,Positive

Im sure it provides good protection but it was impossible to spread it nicely on my face I always just ended up looking like I had a thick layer of white stuff on my face I guess thats fine for going to the beach but not really acceptable for life in the city I much prefer CeraveAM because it can be rubbed in reasonablywell and I dont end up looking like a ghost though I guess its not quite as protective as this product,0.18,0.064,0.757,0.8567,Positive

I have used other products from this brand before and have liked them a lot however this was not great This stuff is so thick that I have to thin it out with moisturizer and even then it just sits on top of my skin making me look Gastly pale IF I managed to get all the lines out In the future I would probably only wear this if I was going to then put makeup on top,0.082,0.042,0.875,0.2746,Positive

I love Cerave products And I was excited to buy this 50 spf sunblock for the face  When I finally used it I found that it was difficult to blend onto skin and it leaves an obvious white cast It also clumps up on pores and black heads that is clearly visible to the naked eye I dont think Ill purchase this again unfortunately,0.167,0.07,0.762,0.7738,Positive

I cant believe I paid 16 to look like a kabuki reject Goes on difficult leaves you looking like a corpse hard to remove and gave me a headache almost immediately At least it doesnt smell Ill try it again next time I work outside Definitely for when you dont care what you look like but dont want skin cancer Cant imagine wearing it with makeup Might work under it but they insist you put it on last Hilarious I dont think itll hold up under sweat Maybe try a sweat band around the hairline,0.169,0.102,0.73,0.8313,Positive

I got this sunscreen because I found my existing goto daily sunscreen had avobenzone and other potentially harmful ingredients and the ingredients in this are much better But Im lily white with a mild tan and this stuff looks like clown makeup on me Does a horrible job blending into your skin to the point that Im not comfortable going out in public with it on unless I use makeup to try to restore a normal shade of color to my skin Let a black friend try some too and it was so clearly just not made with them in mind Dont recommend this as a daily sunscreen,0.142,0.091,0.767,0.7243,Positive
My dermatologist recommended this brand Is a bit lighter and easier to spread than the body cream I like that it has no smell and is not as thick as other sunscreens Holds up well but reapply as per directions after swimming and after 2 hours Their video on how to apply helps Good product at reasonable price,0.218,0.025,0.757,0.882,Positive
I love this product because it doesnt contain all those other harmful chemicals I would give it a 5 star BUT sigh it just does not blend easily I have to dab very small amounts around my face in order for it to blend but it still doesnt spread well This makes it so time consuming when I need a quick skin routine in the morning Also it leaves my skin with a white tint again because it doesnt spread easily I love the product but its just so frustrating to work with,0.096,0.126,0.778,-0.4387,Negative

This sunscreen offers great protection from the sun but it is not good for everyday use The formula leaves a terrible white cast on my skin I am fair in skin color but I can see white streaks across my face In addition its very hard to spread Once it touches the skin the lotion turns chalky or cakey and cant be rubbed across the face without crumbling I have been using this face sunscreen exclusively for running outside or going to the beach but I am in search of a new everyday sunscreen to wear under makeup,0.054,0.091,0.855,-0.5857,Negative

I have been using this sunscreen for years and was excited to see it offered on AmazonTo the reviewers who complain that it has an ashy cast you must understand that zinc and titanium oxide are made from a white powder so there is absolutely no way to make the sunscreen go on clear if you use any type of true mineralbased liquid sunscreen The best way to try and blend this sunscreen as much as possible is to warm it in your hands and apply small amounts in sections on your face It actually works best of you let your moisturizer sink in put the sunscreen on and let it sit on your face for a few moments so it doesnt peelThe new dispenser is great as it has a smaller opening so the sunscreen doesnt squeeze out a huge application As an individual who has sensitive skin and wears sunscreen everyday this product has been awesome at keeping my skin from breaking out and protecting it from the sun,0.14,0.037,0.823,0.9654,Positive
I love this sunscreen and with fair skin that is easily prone to burning I have to wear a serious sunscreen all the time This does the trick Some people may not like the fact that it isnt totally transparent and does show up as white on the skin I dont mind and expect that from a mineral based sunscreen that truly blocks out the harmful rays The most important thing for me is protection and this product delivers,0.163,0.076,0.761,0.8549,Positive
I ordered this product after I received a sample from my dermatologist  Best protection product Ive ever used  There were some nagative reviews because it goes on white and a thick application may stay white  However it depends on your individual needs  I am fair skinned and in my late 50s and just recently was diagnosed with Basel Cell Carcinoma a form of skin cancer on my nose and face  I need a product for sun block and protection  I want it caked on white and to stay white for blockage clear poduct on the best blockage and does not easily sweat off rub off or lose its effectiveness  So for me somebody who needs to protect my face from harmful rays here on out and I am not too proud to cake it on and have a slightly white nose when I am doing yard work playing golf or other outside activites  If you are concerned about appearance then maybe not for you  But if you are concerned about protecting your skin although may not look attractive this prouduct may be for you  I have yet to have a burn on my face with proper application  Wished they had this 20 years ago,0.064,0.064,0.872,-0.2273,Negative

I saw other reviews that said this product was hard to put on looked pastywhite shiny This is not at all what Ive found with this sunscreen product It goes on semiclear smooth nongreasy easy to rub in I compared it with the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc SoftTouch 50 and the CereVe works better for me Its easier to put on  its more hydrating than the Neutrogena Sheer Zinc and doesnt make me look pastywhite The Neutrogena is thicker and harder to put on smoothly but its got a higher amount of zinc oxide whereas CereVe has titanium dioxide as well as zinc oxide I apply my sunscreen every hour when Im outside so the size tube could be smaller to fit into my pocket or fanny pack but Ill still find a way to carry it with me I like it and I know Ill use it Ill still use the Neutrogena product in certain situations but I think my goto sunscreen from now on will be the CeraVe I was not given any product nor was I paid for this Its just my opinion from using both products,0.089,0.062,0.849,0.5106,Positive

I bought this sunscreen after reading the ingredient list multiple times  I was shocked to find out that this cream was both mineralbased and didnt use oil as a binder  I am someone that cant stand chemical sunblock and its chemicals that can be just as damaging as UV rays themselves but every other sunscreen I tried that has zinc turns so oily on my skin that I might as well have dipped my face in canola oil after sweating for 5 minutes  Not only does this STAY on your face but it also doesnt change consistency to a gooey oily mess  For a comparison it has the consistency of the Eucerine Daily protection but less chemicals  It does leave a white cast be warned but if you blend it well enough it will look like you have a soft focus effect from a photo app going on if that makes sense  The only things that would have made this product better is if 1  It came in a larger size  who doesnt always request that    and 2 If it were cruelty free,0.089,0.086,0.825,0.3612,Positive

It does what its supposed to do it protects my skin from the sun But it leaves a big white cast keep in mind Im already very pale and white but that sunscreen made me look like a literal ghost I dont normally wear makeup but the only way Id be able to go outside with that on was putting like 3 layers of powder on Overall it does exactly what its supposed to do and would not recommend if you are a person of color Would recommend if you wear makeup that could cover it up and not make you look like a ghost,0.1,0.099,0.801,0.0439,Neutral

This a mineral sunscreen what used to he called sunblock before everyone started calling everything sunscreen So companies followedThis uses minerals to reflect light off your face Which means there will be a strong white cast Its better for sensitive skin and doesnt need to be reapplied like sunscreens do they use molecules that absorb light but if you have a darker skin tone then this will look like white paste on your skinI like to layer a little bit of mineral sunscreensunblock over sunscreen to reduce white cast but increase the effectiveness of the protection,0.151,0.0,0.849,0.9231,Positive
My grandson has sensitive skin hell break out in a rash from random things But he also loves being outside and doing fun things He has eczema a very light case now but its been an issue Regular sun blocks would protect him from the sun but he would also break out because of the lotion He was have bumps or sometimes just a red irritated look for a day or two after using sun block My daughter had tried just about all the brandsSomeone told me that CeraVe had sun block and it was great My daughter had no idea they made sun block but she was familiar with their lotion because it was always the best in combating his eczema So I sent her a tube and its amazing He doesnt break out at all It is quite thick and takes a bit to soak in  so there may be a white sheen on the skin for a bit but its well worth it,0.172,0.126,0.702,0.9217,Positive

Ok heres the thing I usually LOVE CeraVe products so I was very disappointed when I tried this sunscreen Usually I use Cotz Mineral Primer because it is literally THE BEST sunscreen Ive ever tried Its super smooth nongreasy and has 0 white cast In fact I often use it as a base makeup on the days that I want a more natural look The only issue I have with it is the price I was hoping to find a more affordable everyday option and only use Cotz on special occasions which is why I purchased this sunscreenThe moment I put it on I noticed that it was a super heavy and pasty consistency The other thing I immediately noticed was the white cast Normally I dont mind a little white cast especially if it sinks in and goes away This white cast did not go away I felt like I was putting on a white foundation because it clogged up my pores and dried out my skin Im wondering if the consistency is due to its level of sun protection since its SPF 50 Unfortunately I wont be able to wear this every day as I was hoping and instead will pack this away in the camping gear for long days in the sun where I dont care what I look like Overall definitely wont be buying again in the future,0.167,0.036,0.796,0.9838,Positive
This review is coming from a 40  yo male thats had some sun in the past with some rosacea I can only talk about my experience with the product and it might be good for othersPros is feels like a good moisturizer and makes the face feel really soft when its onCons even using a very small amount of this product it takes time to get it into the skinIf you are a man with some facial hair and you happen to get some on the hair you are gonna spend a lot more time getting it offLooksIn the sun or indoors with lights on I noticed a shine to it Without light or in the shade it takes a white tint to it which might be good if you are pale or a vampireOverall this product appears to stay on well with some tint abnormalities if you look like me but if you are a lady or a very pale guy it might be perfect for you Good luck,0.138,0.0,0.862,0.9674,Positive

This definitely leaves a white cast which goes away shortly Sunscreen is supposed to be applied 15 minutes before sun exposure so the cast is gone by then It is not easy to apply even after trying different methodsyou end up tugging on your face which I try to avoid at my ageMy skin is dry to combo and it is almost too hydrating I found the same with another product that Ive used that is highly rated The one thing it excels at sun protection which is why I will keep using it I have started using it on my hands as well when I anticipate being in the sun Pick your battles I want the protection,0.079,0.06,0.861,0.3387,Positive
My skin is light olive and this product surprisingly blends pretty well and is not garishly whiteThe lotioncream is mediumthick so requires dabbing it on in spots around your face then patting and blending it in  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it blended  There is a slight sheer white sheen initially but it goes invisible as your body warms it up Its lightweight as they claim and it is not greasy feeling With the added ceramides and niacinamide my face never feels dry  Im glad Cerave made this SPF 50 and will always have it on hand Ive learned late in life that sunscreen is absolutely necessary to maintain a smooth textured and spot free skin and will use this product to best advantage  I prefer using the mineral screen over the chemical one because we already face a world with way too many chemicals already,0.197,0.009,0.794,0.9833,Positive
Works well but I have others I prefer more  I have a friend with fair skin and he let me use this He loves it Never burns with it on It does leave white on your face but provides a good block I used his when I visited him in Nevada and had to buy more since we brought his home in our suitcase Had to replace hiswouldnt want him to burn So I still have a partial tube He now has the new one I live in a sunshine state and use sunscreen a lot but prefer to just cover up with a hat I dont think I would use this again if I had a more better alternative made more for women Ive used Image Skincare Obaji No 7 concealer with sunscreen which I love and now Coola love this too I would buy this for the guys in my house who are just looking for a block and dont mind having white show up on their face Hope this helps,0.244,0.06,0.696,0.9904,Positive

I really disliked this product I am super pale and it left a white cast on me that never went away people kept telling me that I looked like a ghost Its also very hard to spread because its so thick It doesnt work well under foundation either The only sunscreen that Ive found that hasnt left me with a white cast and dryness is Black Girl Sunscreen,0.09,0.124,0.787,-0.1027,Negative
I have used this product before and love it  My skin is very fair and I need sunscreen on my face every day  Products with nonmineral ingredients avobenzone oxybenzone etc seem to creep across my skin and cause my eyes to burn after a few hours  I also need a noncomedogenic formula  I will keep using this product but I will buy it in the store where I can check the expiration date because its just not acceptable to receive the package on Oct 30 and find it expires in January,0.051,0.028,0.921,0.2391,Positive

It has pretty strong white cast I went about 2 shades lighter than my normal skin tone with this on It was also very thick and somewhat difficult to rub in Although makeup applies nicely over the top of it and I didnt have any cakeyness or creasing It did though almost act as a primer and it melted my powers to make them look more like skin which was a plus If you have oily skin it might just make you look shinny  but anything to protect me from the sun,0.136,0.017,0.847,0.8516,Positive
Originally bought this as I love most all CeraVe products and wanted to keep consistent with my face wash and moisturizers but its awful It smells like motor oil it leaves a HORRID white cast that makes you look like a vampire it takes a very long time to soak in and for the white cast to shade and  beware of putting moisturizer ontop of it You have to wait like 20 mins before you can continue the rest of your skin care or the sunscreen will start to flake and ball up with whatever products are out ontop of it Not a satisfying purchase,0.137,0.107,0.756,0.3778,Positive
I chose this because I wanted an everyday mineral sunscreen  Unfortunately it is very white and extremely hard to rub in to make it disappear  leaving a whitish cast to the skin which doesnt look natural or healthy  It also is tough to remove  traces were still on my skin after a showerIf you dont mind these aspects then you might like this product  I will go back to a tinted mineral sunscreen instead,0.069,0.127,0.805,-0.3406,Negative

This sunscreen works incredibly well and as usual CeraVe did a great job with the formula It spreads easily and is moisturising without being greasy However it leaves the most intense white cast Ive ever seen with a sunscreen Im very pale and even on me it looks ridiculous So if youre a person of color this product probably wont work for you unless you want to look like youre wearing Elizabethian makeup in which case go for itFor this reason I dont recommend it for everyday wear Youll have to apply a lot of makeup to cover up the white cast This is more for a day when youre going to be outside all day I live in a cold and overcast area so for this reason I wont buy this again until summer and will find a different everyday sunscreen,0.1,0.032,0.868,0.826,Positive
the cream looked like new but the box and container of the cream looked weird  Im used to buying that cream in stores and they dont look the same  the cream only came halfway  I tried a little bit of the cream on my hand and it stay white it does not seal well on the skin the skin does not dissolve it,0.09,0.063,0.847,0.4174,Positive

So the product does well to protect the skin it just leaves a white cast  will pill if mixed with something else I usually use a moisturizer with my sunscreen  even when I waited a while to put on the sunscreen it pilled  was a really thick white cast I had to rinse my face  then reapply the sunscreen Also forget about wearing makeup with this because it does the same thing with your makeup It looks horrendous So just expect to only wear this  this only if you buy it Which is totally fine it is designed to protect the skin which is what it does,0.086,0.052,0.862,0.4005,Positive

Finally a sunscreen I can trust to protect the sensitive eczemaprone skin on my face  Its very moisturizing has a very subtle scent and really protects  However it is not light or sheer  In fact I would describe it as heavy and creamy  Its heavy enough that it actually lends a sort of pale cast to your skin when youre wearing it This is worth it for me when I need real sun protection more than just a moisturizer with SPF  I was previously using the Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer in SPF 50  It is more sheer but gets slimy and stings my eyes when Im really sweating like in an outdoor workout or at the pool  This is now my goto sunscreen for any outdoor activity  It works it lasts it moisturizes and my sensitive skin doesnt mind it,0.1,0.0,0.9,0.8739,Positive

After noticing this was an oil free formula I specifically asked whether this worked over oilbased moisturizers People said it did However I suspect these folks are using thin lightweight lotions not heavy creams This absolutely DOES NOT go on smoothly over an oil based moisturizer Its patchy and streaky as the oils and water dont really mix You HAVE to wear makeup over it to cover it upAnd the trouble is whatever is in this stuff RUINS makeup every time My favorite mineral makeup settled into pores and goes on patchy with this Last straw was when I was going to the Renaissance Fair I used a great primer longwear foundation and setting spray over the Cerave sunscreen the makeup began FLAKING OFF and it was impossible to repair I had to wear a mask because there was no way to fix it even washing off and starting over it just began again because it was the sunscreen causing the trouble This bottle went into the trash after that Never using this brand again,0.069,0.073,0.859,0.0688,Positive
The SPF is good Broad spectrum to protect from UVA and UVB I like the fact it is mineral based but the minerals make the sunscreen leave behind a white castThe white cast can be fixed be applying the sunscreen first then using a moisturizer on top of it and coating your skin evenly in it Also only using about a teaspoon on the sunscreen for each application helps reduce the appearance of the white castOverall a good product with good protection Needs some help when being spread Easily fixed with moisturizer,0.257,0.012,0.73,0.9734,Positive
Great sun protection but it leaves a major white cast Even putting it on as suggested in tiny spots around the face almost does nothing Then youre tugging at your skin to try and spread it Ugh BUT Ive found if you put it on RIGHT AFTER your moisturizer it spreads and blends soooo much easier Overall good product though,0.147,0.054,0.799,0.7506,Positive

I bought this for my neck which sometimes burns and for my chocolate colored sun worshiping toddler  We both ended looking like ghosts It stays on the toddler all day through many pool capers AND through bath time  It takes slathering her up with coconut oil to eventually get it to come off of her  It didnt seem particularly moisturizing at all actually it seems rather drying  But hey as long as shes protected from skin cancer and my neck isnt burning its better than nothing,0.074,0.096,0.831,-0.626,Negative
I was hoping to combine my moisturizing and sunscreen regimen into one step but I cant quite do it here The product didnt feel as moisturizing as a moisturizing cream  As a sunblock I havent truly put it to the test but I like to use only mineral sunscreens and this fits that bill  It does leave my skin looking a little white which I am ok with It had no smell which I like  The product did not come with a safety seal which concerned me at first but I read that that is how it normally comes new,0.109,0.1,0.791,0.2484,Positive
I bought this sunscreen because my old spf burned my eyes and made me break out i would like to say ive been using this one for a few days and it does not burn my eyes or make me breakout it also doesnt feel greasy at all and only feels moisturizing on the skin after it has sunk in However this is a horrid whitecast that  you have to spend quite a bit of time rubbing in other than that unfortunate fact i would recommend If you are a POC or a bit tanner like me Id maybe look into a less white casty sunscreen but this one is not awful,0.077,0.039,0.884,0.4973,Positive

All PHYSICAL sunscreen will be difficult to spread and leave a white tint behind The active ingredients zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are also pigments that make white paint Rather than the chemical UV protectants like oxybenzone that soak into the skin and get into your blood these sit on the surface and eventually fall offI am a chemist and a burn survivor that happened from a fire at work While Im healing UV exposure has the threat of leaving my affected skin permanently discolored This means that I have to wear sunscreen everyday and putting traditional sunscreen on daily would increase my exposure to oxybenzone and oxycrylene which is why I am using this product and Im glad it has a moisturizing effect as well,0.113,0.083,0.805,0.6124,Positive

This is my favorite facial sunscreen It leaves a slight white cast on even my light ivory skin so careful for those with darker skin unless you wear makeup on top of it It does not pill under makeup and moisturizes well It doesnt make me breakout on my sensitive skin  Im just disappointed that the one I got had an expiration date only 2 months away I guess its technically not a big deal since Im in the middle of the hot summer and will likely use it all But I have no choice but to order online since I never see this in stores So just dont go ordering multiple ones at once keeping the expiration date issue in mine that Ive seen in other reviews too,0.051,0.038,0.911,-0.0879,Negative
I like Cera Ve products very much and this is excellent sunblock with both titanium dioxide and zinc  If you really want to protect your skin you need both these ingredients  Having said that it does leave your skin with a whitish sheen so if youre more worried about how it looks than superior sun protection you may not like it  Also it has a slight chemical odor to it  I dont mind any of that because Im far more concerned about a recurring case of skin cancer than I am anything else  I will continue to purchase it  Im happy they improved their formula and that the increased the size of the tube so you dont have to buy it so often  Good price if you want excellent sun protection,0.225,0.054,0.721,0.9748,Positive
I definitely would not reccomend this I immediately got rid of it after using it onceIts thick and somewhat chalky and worst of all it leaves a white cast that is impossible to blend outKeep in mind Im very pale I normally use the cerave AM spf 30 moisturizing lotion for normalcombination skin It leaves a slight white cast but its hydrating and easy to blend It does leave a bit of shine but nothing bad its oil freeIf youre looking for something that doesnt leave a white cast and is a clean chemical sunscreen Id reccomend the Supergoop unseen sunscreen Its spf 40 doesnt leave any cast whatsoever its completely clear blends like a dream and doubles as a primerIf you want to stick with Cerave their ultra light matte spf 30 am lotion is great It doesnt leave a cast is extremely light easy to blend and moisturizing yet matteIf you want a good mineral sunscreen Id check out Supergoop and Coola Ceraves just doesnt have the formulation right and the white cast is insane,0.199,0.057,0.745,0.985,Positive

So a lot of complaints say this doesnt spread and leaves a white case I can say I was super disappointed as well To be fair the description warns you about this applying a small amount at a time and rubbing it in well to prevent thisIf that still leaves a white cast its because its 100 mineral based but dont worry i got you sisTake a dab of cerave and a dab of face lotionmaybe cerave face lotion and mix it on your fingers  Problem solved I admittedly dont use a ton of sunblock but i do use enough that even with this technique I still have a SLIGHT white hue Not as noticeable before and perfectly acceptable in day to day life I no longer feel like a clown,0.19,0.085,0.725,0.925,Positive
Im natururally quite pale and with this sunscreen I look like a ghost And its doesnt spread evenly It sits on your skin like a thick white butter  Oh gosh To remove this stuff I need to wash my face 23 times I have accidentally applied this spf to my eyebrows so I had to use shampoo and oil to remove it Awful product Never expected something like this from Cerave,0.101,0.104,0.795,-0.0516,Negative

If you want to look like a ghost then this is the product for you I bought this because Cerave is a great product for skin but it is not easy to spread evenly It leaves a white film at least on dark skin and you just look horrible Not a fan of this If you trying to pick up men on the beach Ladies esp dark skin women Dont do this I promise you will go home alone ,0.102,0.165,0.733,-0.7625,Negative

Hurrrrgh Yeah youre gonna wanna trust the reviews for this one The white cast is nuuuuts on the product I got and I am FAIR fair Also had a bit of pilling issue when used at the end of my skincare routine CeraVe has some wonderful skincare products but I would personally only recommend this one if youre swimming or doing a long hike that requires some very obvious and intense sunscreen For the ability to fade into my skin I would choose Neutrogena sunscreen or another for my daily use,0.188,0.0,0.812,0.9302,Positive

I need maximum sun protection because I break out into a red itchy rash otherwise  This sunscreen has prevented me from getting that rash so Im quite relieved and grateful for that  But its quite thick and thus quite hard to rub in  Even when I think Ive gotten it rubbed in well later in the day I see streaks of it I missed  Its effective but cumbersome,0.163,0.136,0.701,0.4535,Positive
Ive heard so many reviews about this product This sunscreen definitely does the job of protecting I was super sad to try this sunscreen and not have it work on me since I use mostly cerave products As someone who has naturally tan skin I wouldnt recommend it to people of color It leaves a white cast and doesnt melt into the face like other sunscreen,0.128,0.073,0.799,0.598,Positive

I am 52 yrs old and have Lupus and eczema so I must use a mineral sunscreen and still can have allergic reactions This is the ONLY sunscreen out of the dozens Ive used that I have had no bad reaction to It moisturizes my skin and the sunblock works perfectlyThis is very thick and white so I use it as primer and spf Once foundation is applied over this after this has absorbed 30 seconds the white cast is undetectable and my skin appears smoother no poresI will continue to purchase this as long as they make it,0.0,0.101,0.899,-0.8442,Negative

I was hoping to find a daily use sunblock for my face Even though this is a good brand and designed for facial application it will not work for daily use It is difficult to spread on delicate skin such as around the eyes It is unflattering in regard to how it sits on the skin and my face has a weird white and shiny look to it This will likely be good for a day in the sun without makeup but will not work for daily use,0.079,0.036,0.885,0.4215,Positive

Okay Im coming after everyone who says it sucksIm pale as the snow so of course  the white cast doesnt show If you have darker skin tones please get a different one 3I have highly irritable skin from eczema And this felt heavenly And still does I plan on using this for foundation to help my vampiric  behind in the sunThe scent is barely there I was suprised It vaugley smells like minerals  but that has to be up close to your face and looking for a scent Its super freaking moisturizing,0.145,0.059,0.796,0.7686,Positive
The ingredients in CeraVe products are usually great unfortunately this sunscreen leaves a very heavy white cast It is easy to spread at first and does moisturize but as soon as it sets if you continue to blend in it turns into flakes and comes off and forget about putting make up over it So if you are only concerned about the sun protection and dont care about the white cast than I guess this is a good product for you,0.095,0.085,0.82,0.2163,Positive
Look I am about as white as they come and this stuff just never absorbed well or lost its extremely white cast more like mask Cant imagine what it would look like if put the correct amount needed for full sun protection The only way I could use it was to top it off with a tinted sunscreen and that still didnt eliminate the whiteness completely Really disappointed since other Cerave products are so good,0.133,0.093,0.775,0.5174,Positive

This is literally like putting white paint on your face i give it 4 stars cuz it obvs works However the white didnt go away and I had to blend more moisturizer on to fade the white The white cast stayed for a very long time  So id keep that in mind if you wanted to give this a shot and your skin isnt FFFFFF exactly,0.04,0.0,0.96,0.3612,Positive

I love Cerave skin lotion for my face but this stuff Absolute crap I think think this was invented as a seriously screwed up practical joke When you apply it and rub it in on and into your face or so you think you are rubbing it in it leaves a slight white haze that you can live with because you think the rest will just absorb inThats when Cerave starts to giggle at you  Within 20 minutes of applying it comes back out giving you a deathly pale look about you AND now the product is full out laughing at you My story  In my extremely well lit bathroom  I applied liberally because I burn easily got it to a point of not having too much white junk on my face that I could live with and hopped on my motorcycle to meet my guys for a ride Got to the first destination spot within 20 minutes and was met with laughter and taunts of being called Dr Evil  I can take a joke because I give them too so its part of the game with my friends but I refuse to walk around with this crap on my face making me look like  a corpse,0.156,0.114,0.73,0.8438,Positive

First of all hate writing reviews hardly ever do them So Im have pretty light skin with a bit of rosacea on my cheeks This sunscreen has a glueish texture very sticky and super hard to spread Ive tried and tried to work it out but no success I literally looked like a freaking corpse omg The only solution in a pinch was rubbing a tinted sunscreen on top and run to work One of my biggest Cerave disappointment did not expect that I wouldnt recommend this to anyone unless you want to look like you were sprayed with white paint No thanks,0.205,0.191,0.604,0.202,Positive
So i bought this product thinking it was a rlly nice lightweight lotion for my face which is mostly my fault because other reviews do note that its more a sunscreen less of a moisturizer Its a great sunscreen Very nice coverage doesnt smell or make my skin feel greasy but I dont think this is a good product for your face It leaves a terrible white case and I also noticed it broke apart my foundation really bad If you want to use it on your face I suggest rubbing it in really good on your fingers before putting it on your face and mixing a little bit of your favorite lotion with it,0.153,0.117,0.73,0.384,Positive

This sunscreen is genuinely l√© WORST I wouldnt feel obligated to leave a scathing review of this sunscreen wasnt marketed as a FACE sunscreen I know that sunscreen need to be worked in but im also almost 40 and Im not willing to take a floor buffer to my faceand in this case I dont know if it would helpThe photo attached is after I worked it in moderately AND wore it for over an hour You would not want to leave the house of you applied anywhere near the appropriate amount of product for sun protectionI actually purchased this as a neck sunscreen whos extra It Me So youThat I wouldnt burn through my more expensive sunscreen or worry about a tint on my clothes The formula is not drying but I will not be repurchase this product even for my neck because the cast is out of this world and is not manageableMy holy grail sunscreen is the La Roche Posay tinted Anthelios mineral spf 50 that one is worth every penny watch for coupons to grab it for less than 30 I also enjoy the Cera Ve hydrating tinted SPF 30 though I wish it were available in a higher SPFEither way this one is an unbearable mess IMHO,0.048,0.065,0.888,-0.1405,Negative

I bought this sunscreen to add to my daily regimen because of the new AHAs Ive included suggest additional sun protection I was hopeful because CeraVe is known for its lotions While using the product I did not burn however in the application tips it says the formula should spread easily leaving a lightweight nongreasy feel This product did not spread easily and felt as light as cheap drugstore foundation Fortunately the greasy feeling only took 20 minutes to go away The directions state to apply liberally but the application tips say to apply a small amount in the palm of your hands Well apply it liberally and you end up looking like a ghost Apply a small amount to your palm and rubbing well is just schmusing your face all over in a very unpleasant manner I cant imagine wearing makeup under this Definitely dont recommend unless youre going for a cliche white cast sunscreened face like you see on the kids with helicopter moms in movies,0.127,0.057,0.816,0.8619,Positive

I was aware this SPF will leave a white cast Its true but Considering the ingredients and benefits I like it I totally recommend this item but to make the white cast less noticeable I have some easy recommendations  Make sure you heat the product by rubbing it on your fingers for 10 to 20 seconds and add a bit of your moisturizer  And when you apply it to your skin dont rub it Apply it in padding motions enough to cover your face neck and chest,0.202,0.012,0.786,0.958,Positive

Bought this sunscreen because it was mineral based  a high SPF protection level for my faceskin which is important for my sensitive skin However despite having fairly fair skin myself it makes me look like casper the ghost if I apply the correct amount of sunscreen for protection I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately only wear it now if I wear a full face of makeup over it so that I can at least finish the bottle without completely wasting my money If you are looking for a good mineral sunscreen check out CeraVes 30 SPF mineral sunscreen that has a tint to it  perfect for everyday wear and doesnt leave a terrible white cast,0.178,0.049,0.773,0.9461,Positive
I have a medium olive complexion and this sunscreen left a pretty bad white cast on my face I figured maybe rubbing in the product more would help it blend in better but it didnt Instead it roughed up a lot of the dry skin I have on my face making me look flaky and left me with sticky feeling If I scratch my neck the stickiness transfers over to my finger tips Its awful Its also not the easiest to spread around Such a shame because I normally love CeraVe products but this one was just a miss for me,0.124,0.139,0.737,-0.4037,Negative

As someone who is already uh overserved with shine and whiteness this product is a dud The formula is thick and pastelike and spreads poorly If it wont blend into my pasty mug its not going to work for most folks Ill be using it for the backs of my hands prebikeride until is runs out,0.0,0.108,0.892,-0.6461,Negative
I love Cerave products but this one is horrible I expected some white cast because this is a mineral sunscreen but usually the white cast fades on me after a few minutes  I have light skin so white cast is usually this is not a problem but this one does not fade  It made me look like a ghost until I took it off eight hours or so later  Also there is a strange smell kind of like gasoline when you first put it on  It fades or I go nose blind after a few minutes but it is there whenever I use this product Ive tried three times and I think Im done  My recommendation is to skip this one until its reformulated or  unless you like the whitenosed lifeguard look all over your face,0.107,0.094,0.799,0.1991,Positive

This was one of the worst sunscreens I have ever used It felt like rubbing thick chalk lotion w sand I have normal combination skin onto my face  it looked absolutely terribly on without even putting makeup on top of it I would honestly hate  to even think or try to layer it with how chalky thick  dry this was like a sandy paste on my face I cant speak for how well it worked because I was not going out in public looking like that I really wanted to love this but ended up having to removed this w a makeup wipe because of the consistency Absolute no from me and Im very pale so the fact it was too thick  too white for me is a lot  Save your money and buy something else,0.123,0.072,0.805,0.6231,Positive

This sunscreen is best for people with light skin I use it everyday My daughter is olive skinned and tan and it leaves too much chalky cast for her For me it works beautifully It protects me from the sun moisturizes my skin really well and doesnt irritate my face at all I recommend it if your skin is fair enough to handle the zink cast it is unnoticeable on me but very distracting on my darker skinned daughter,0.156,0.038,0.806,0.7289,Positive

This sunscreen did protect my face from the sun which is obviously great however it really does leave a major white cast which all other reviews state as well I honestly though that people were just being delicate but it is so thick and difficult to spread out which makes it hard to rub in the whiteness It also made my makeup start to ball up Ill wear it if Im not wearing any makeup and Im swimming or hiking and need really good protection but definitely not a daily face spf,0.16,0.097,0.743,0.6863,Positive
I wanted to love this sunscreen so much like I love my other cerave products But this product is so thick and tacky that its hard to spread and it leaves the worst white cast Ive ever seen I literally looked like a ghost after trying to massage it in for over a minute Not only that but it made my face break out in massive under the skin zits The only pro is that it does its job of protecting my skin from the sun,0.113,0.107,0.779,-0.1137,Negative
I generally like and use many ceraVe products However I have been disappointed with this It has a physical sunblock with SPF 50 which is what I was looking for however it is very thick and does not rub in It leaves a significant white cast on my face I have been using a small amount mixed in with foundation make up which seems to diminish the whiteness I will use it like this however I will not purchase again,0.088,0.04,0.871,0.4019,Positive

Please do not ignore the reviews that tell you this product does not rub in well and that it leaves a white cast on your face  I thought I could get away with that as Im quite fair  But no amount of rubbing gets this product to absorb into your face  As such you will be left with a skim coat on your face that will peek through any makeup you may have on and highlight any pores you may have  My daughter kept looking at me and telling me I had something on my face  It is incredibly hard to remove from your skin but will rub off easily on clothes or furniture if any is left on your hands after application  Nor does it feel moisturizing at all  My skin felt incredibly dry and flaky after using it  I need a very high spf product due to skin cancer issues but this is definitely not the one,0.087,0.075,0.838,0.0024,Neutral

PRO The ingredients dont irritate my skin and the formula after drying down it feels nongreasy and moisturizing on my face NOTE Please expect whitecast as this product doesnt contain nanoparticles of sunscreen ingredients fyi I have fair skinCON The formula is very difficult to spread  I would recommend patiently applying a little amount at a time Otherwise uneven application would leave obvious white marks on your face and youd have to tug your skin a lot which caused my skin to get pretty red This product is not water resident but because of the thick formula reapplying the sunscreen is hellAll in all the application makes using the product impractical and I wouldnt recommend this to anyone,0.113,0.025,0.862,0.8161,Positive

I love most CeraVe products but not this one  I use the hydrating facial cleanser moisturizing lotion with sunscreen pm moisturizer and they all work well for me I wanted something with a higher SPF than the 30 in the facial am moisturizer so I picked up the SPF 50 face sunscreen because I have rosacea and burn at the drop of a hat so I dont  take any chances It is very protective even forgiving if I forget to reapply after swimming and it does not irritate my skin But I am pale and this leaves a white film on my face that is noticeable I would not agree with the package that it is lightweight I have to avoid rubbing it in around my eyebrows and hairline because once it gets in the hair forget about trying to rub it in It also soaks into every pore It is great under my makeup with primer on top For a day at the lakebeach I deal with looking whiter than usual and usually use a mirror when I reapply to avoid looking like Casper the friendly ghost I will be happy when the tube runs out Its protective but the formula is aesthetically awful I will find another brand that doesnt make me look like Im painted,0.15,0.102,0.748,0.9407,Positive

I love the brand Cerave They make great skin products This sunscreen is SPF 50 which is a good SPF level The ingredients are titanium and zinc which are really good It is a mineral sunscreen which means it is more of a natural product and healthier for you than chemical sunscreen It also has 3 essential ceramides and niacinamides which are ingredients to promote healthy skin and restore its natural barrier It wont clog your pores  It is accepted by the national eczema association It is not greasy nor does it have a strong scent The 25 ounce is a good size sunscreen Not too big or small The thing I dont like about this product is that it is hard to rub in and does leave you with a white complexion I hope they improve on the consistency and color Also it does not say that it is waterproof I hope they make a waterproof version for the beach or for when you sweat Overall this is a great product in that it has many health benefits but it needs to be fine tuned to be an even better product,0.199,0.025,0.776,0.9815,Positive

I bought this thinking it would be good since I already use their standard lotion I have super sensitive skin so sticking to a brand that I dont have issues with was the idea Fortunately Im not breaking out or anything but the more you rub the sunscreen in the more it balls up and rubs off your face It also has a AWFUL white cast that behind Im pasty as is so for it to be so prominent on my skin tone is really bad Anyone with even slightly darker complexion than mine would never be able to use this The only reason its getting a two star is because Im not breaking out in hives,0.068,0.083,0.849,-0.5997,Negative
I feel deceived because its very good price at the time Im looking for a sunscreen I bought it and hope it will work so that I can save money on suncreen It turns out a big disappointment It causes me breakouts and make my face look pale and too white I dont recommend it for face,0.152,0.132,0.716,0.3064,Positive

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Cerave products But this stuff sucks Its like ashy grease paint It does not feel good on the skin I guess it provides good sunscreen but its currently running off my face so Im not even sure about that I probably need to rub it in more but it doesnt seem like it wants to absorb Yes I understand how mineral sunscreen works but I might prefer smearing straight zinc across my face  I even read reviews before purchasing and thought What the hell Im only going to wear it around the house to walk the dog or garden and Im super pale anyway Ugh Ill use it up but I dont have to like it,0.196,0.168,0.636,0.492,Positive
This is thick and VERY white after application Probably effective but not ideal Get a tinted sunscreen Alternatively I liked Cetaphil brand much better for a mineral sunscreen better because it sits on top of your skin that isnt as visible,0.305,0.071,0.624,0.8998,Positive

First let me start by saying I have extremely fair skin and the white cast this leaves is even ridiculous on me My sister even commented and I quote what are you trying out to be a mime now I expect some white cast with a zinc sunscreen but Ive never had it this bad Also This is extremely hard to even apply almost like its drying down the second it touches your face and hard to move around after CeraVe usually makes such great products so I was surprised at how awful this one was,0.119,0.142,0.739,-0.3595,Negative

Pros does a good job of protecting skin from the sun Ideal to use after procedures like Bluelight spider vein removal and skin peelingCons ALL mineral based sun screens leave a white mask on your face And this one is no different You will look like an actor in a Chinese opera And it doesnt fade over time Its there until you wash it off Applying a thin layer makes you less white but decreases the effectiveness of the cream,0.095,0.034,0.871,0.6059,Positive
CeraVe should improve this formulation It is very difficult to disperse even if you apply an oil before or mix with another cream I tried everything but helpless White residues remain all over your face I will try to consume on hands or decollete where there is less attention,0.038,0.114,0.849,-0.6055,Negative

Agree with others that this is not for people of color Any amount of colorpigmentation If you have very pale skin and are okay with looking like matte white paint this may work for you I could not work it into my skin as it dries quickly and does not appear to absorb but rather sits mostly on the surface It literally looked like a beauty cream mask ladies go to sleep with I arrived at my daughters track meet and it still had not absorbed after 30 minutes and would not budge Too embarrassed to be seen like that I went home to scrub it off with soap Had to soap scrub and rinse 3 times to get it all off  I did not buy this on Amazon but at CVS Pharmacy on the way to the meet Worst sunscreen I have ever worn probably effective though,0.156,0.052,0.793,0.9333,Positive
We have used Cerave sunblock on our sons sensitive skin for many years and it works great in terms of blocking the sun and preventing burns  Unfortunately I have been unable to use it due to having a relatively dark complexion especially during the summer  the previous versions of Cerave would always leave a white residue  even when I applied as the bottle directsThis sunscreen is specially formulated for use on the face The key is to not apply it too thickly  I place a very small amount between me thumb and the pads of my first 2 fingers and rub them back and forth prior to massaging it into a small area of my face at a time  This can not be applied like your typical sunscreen or it will create a white sheenIve found that it doesnt have to be applied heavily to be effective  This is a good product for moderately sunny days but its not what Id use on full days on the beachThis is a quality product and works well as long as long as its not overapplied  This just isnt the easiest sunscreen to use,0.067,0.054,0.88,0.5341,Positive

While this Cerave facial sun screen is advertised as being the number one recommended brand by dermatologists there are some things that keep it from being a five star productFirst and foremost it is thick and hard to work in One B it leaves you looking like you have white makeup on think Goth or a geisha perhaps This isnt the look my fairskinned gf was seeking Its thick and eventually cakes up when coupled with sweat and daily wear and tear can look kind of terribleOn the other hand it does sun protect the price is fair and it doesnt leave you feeling too greasy Its a mixed bag,0.13,0.024,0.846,0.8773,Positive
I love this brand and the thought of natural products The instructions leave me feeling confused Do I sacrifice skin protection so I do not look like I am wearing white lead paint from the Elizabethan period or do I embrace the look white and for superior protection The interior application tips even contradicts itselfFirst it says to apply small amounts to an area and then rub it in well to reduce the appearance pf the white cast Then it says to apply liberally for sun protection I have tried to do both However that does not work I have found that my favorite way to use this product is to use it when I am going to be wearing a makeup foundation so I can counter the white cast with my foundation Thank you so much for taking the time to read my reviewI hope the information that Ive provided helps to make your decision a little easierIf you found this review helpful please click the Helpful button below,0.189,0.043,0.768,0.9776,Positive
my BIL who has a skin condition called VITILIGO aka Palamino syndrome  This is a life long condition where the pigment is lost from the skin and becomes highly sensitive  Hes mostly affected on the arms and face and needs sunscreen year roundThis Mineral sunscreen is a barrier type product  All of those complaints about the white residue are actually complaining about the very thing that blocks the sun completely  Folks that absolutely need that protection understand  It will wash off when youre done bring out in the sun  While youre in the sun you can SEE if youre properly protected  Its not as obvious as straight zinc oxide nowhere closeThere is a bit of a smell to the lotion not exactly a fragrance cause its not really pleasant  The lotion goes on without too much difficulty altho its a bit drying  It does what its supposed to do  it blocks the sun  The tube is easy to handle cause its not shiny plastic a small thing that matters with lotiony handsAll things considered a product worthy of consideration for your sunscreen needs,0.072,0.09,0.838,-0.3421,Negative
Because this sunscreen is a physical rather than a chemical sunscreen it is going to give your skin a white sheen  that is how it works Unfortunately I found that this sunscreen in addition to giving my skin a white sheen also left my skin feeling sticky I did not like that sensation It smells like lotion rather than smelling like sunscreen which to me is a positive It is great protection from the sun,0.144,0.109,0.747,0.5954,Positive
I was looking for an everyday sunscreen for my face and heard this was a good option The very first day I used it I realized that it left a lot of white cast behind Ive been using it everyday since Im currently working from home thanks to being quarantined but I will most likely have to find a better option that I can wear under my make up once I eventually go back to work in the office,0.104,0.0,0.896,0.775,Positive
I put this on and immediately looked like a mime  Im sure it would look fine with makeup over it but then why not buy the Cerave tinted sunscreen  I wouldnt even put this on my 6 year old I dont care how much protection it offers it looked hideous  I immediately regretted my decision  Back it goes,0.082,0.117,0.801,-0.6177,Negative
Works well for sun coverage but be prepared to look like your face is painted Even with minimizing the amount applied and rubbing it in well My whole family is Hispanic and we all looked quite pasty I find this to be common with mineral based sunscreens but not all We will keep this for emergencies and use just for lower extremities,0.143,0.041,0.816,0.7184,Positive
Im giving this sunscreen 4 stars for now though I havent had an opportunity to give it the acid test which is wearing it while playing tennis in the hot sun during the summer  I have to wear a good sunscreen that will keep my skin safe from damaging sun rays but will not sting my eyes should it run into them  I dont know if this sunscreen will sting or not and it doesnt say anything about that on the box  I like Cerave lotions and have used a lot of them in the past including sunscreens so I expect this sunscreen to work well  If it doesnt I will be back to update this review,0.111,0.033,0.857,0.7955,Positive
While the product is easy to spread and I felt protected from the sun it leaves way too much residue on your face Especially since I have dark skin even a little amount is obvious I bought because of the essential ingredients it contains but I dont think I can continue wearing during the day,0.077,0.0,0.923,0.4404,Positive
I have dry sensitive skin and I have used lots of sunscreen but never found anything like this Its the worst of them all I always research tons of time before buying any product and the only reason I bought this product was because I was on a hiking trip and I forgot to pack my usual sunscreen and had to go to a nearby store to my hotel and pick any sunscreen that I could find Although there were 34 other sunscreens present in the store but the reason I picked this is because its from CeraVe But please dont get fooled like me I love all the CeraVe products especially their AM sunscreen but this is way different from that product This product leaves the worst white cast very difficult to spread and extremely difficult to get off I tried to mix it with my daily moisturizer and although it become easy to apply it is still very difficult to remove I use retinol in the night which is why I avoid using AHASalicyclic facewash and I use CeraVe hydrating facewash but its very difficult to get it off with that and even with AHA facewash it doesnt come off I can try using cleansing balms to remove it but its just like adding an extra stepproduct in my nighttime routine Stay away from this product,0.061,0.147,0.791,-0.9701,Negative

I tend to burn easily and always use an SPF of 50 for my face especially this brand is one of the few that contains zinc oxide and that is the ingredient I look for to make sure I get the level of protection that I want This is also one of the acceptable brands that is OK to use in places such as Hawaii where they want to protect their reef coral etc and require certain types so its safe for marine lifeThis is lightweight and goes on easily and it does give your face a white look It does have some moisturizing effects One thing to note however is that you will likely have a hard time using it under foundation or any other makeup I do reapply every 2 hours when Im out during the day especially when by water,0.154,0.009,0.837,0.9546,Positive
All good sun protection products have zinc oxide Zinc is the key ingredient And zinc is why the product is so white on the face The good news before applying to face first rub this product and a regular light moisturizing lotion eg Vanicream light moisturizing lotion together in your hands Now it will absorb well into your skin,0.126,0.0,0.874,0.7845,Positive

This is a good product if you are looking for protectionI use it when I run on the trails for about 1 hour and does not get any sunburn on my face I tend to get very red and then dark when I get sunI do not like to tan therefore I stay away from the sun as much as I can but I do enjoy working out outside so I need a good skin protectorI have not used it under make up but I doubt I could I have oily skin and this would make my face oilier under makeupIt is thick and will not spread as water but its not pasty neither I didnt have an issue spreading itIt is white but will fade away shortlyI would definitely use it for the beach or a day outside when I am not wearing make up,0.096,0.034,0.87,0.8703,Positive
So disappointed in this sunscreenextremely difficult to rub in  After warming up the product by rubbing my palms together  applying to my face it left a whitish residue on my skin I finally had to remove it with a warm washcloth What happened Cerave  Are you reading the reviews Their products are usually of the highest standard  Seriously need to redo  improve this product,0.093,0.11,0.797,-0.2944,Negative
Like all physical and mineral sunscreens that contain zinc andor titanium dioxide they will without a doubt leave the dreaded whitecast However this sunscreen does NOT absorb and does not blend into your face at all Even when it is rubbed in and somewhat absorbed 10 minutes later the whitecast is still so visible it renders this product as unusableAt best I would use this sunscreen strictly for a beach or lounge outside day as a BODY spfIf youre into CeraVe products maybe try their tinted version of this I havent used that but it cant be any worse than this one,0.099,0.023,0.878,0.7149,Positive
I was recommend by my dermatologist to use CeraVe sunscreen 50 SPF after I removed 3 moles possible skin cancer This product is made with clean ingredients without making me teary But this sunscreen is thick and hard to rub in on my face completely It is a moisturizing version of CeraVes previous version which I didnt like I like this sunscreen a lot better This sunscreen would be appropriate to fair to medium skin tone people Because this sunscreen will change your brighten up your skin tone slightly Overall I am happy with the result after applying this sunscreen Much better than most other sunscreen that Ive tried so far I would recommend Also I would recommend this sunscreen especially for kids because this sunscreen is very lightweight moisturizing also,0.199,0.066,0.735,0.9667,Positive

This earns one star instead of zero because the ingredients are really great and it provides good sun protection It has a very intense white cast on my very pale skin It also rubs off very easily  say if you happen to barely touch your face Not only does it come off easily on my fingers and get all over my keyboard but its sticky and gets all over clothes I would avoid this unless it was the only sun protection option on earth or I was beginning a Kabuki career,0.103,0.03,0.867,0.5908,Positive

I like how its SFP 50 which is good but it does leave a weird smell and a white caste on your face so dont get the product if you dont mind having a white caste on your face When youre done applying it you can feel the texture of the product so you have to wash your hands after applying it,0.061,0.055,0.885,0.09,Positive

This product is a very effective sun block but if you are a person of color like myself brace yourself for someumm comical results If that werent bad enough the stuff is nearly impossible to wash off even with straight bar soap and a bath poufmaybe dish soap would have worked better My skin is a little on the dry side and this sun block seemed to contribute to the problem Overall not a pleasant experience,0.17,0.148,0.682,0.2479,Positive
So the sunscreen worked well but you literally cant wear it without makeup unless youre a vampire Or John MacLean Im pretty white as it is and usually I can get away with sunscreens with a cast but not this one I had a solid white face Dried nice and matte though and layering wasnt that big of an issue I just dont want to HAVE to wear foundation every single day,0.155,0.018,0.827,0.8784,Positive
This is a quality mineral face sunscreen  It goes on smoothly moisturizes well and provides great protection  It doesnt irritate my wifes sensitive skin which is a huge reason we look for these kinds of sunscreensA couple things to note though  This isnt a waterproof formula and as such washes off quite nicely with water and soap but is therefore obviously not swim or sweatproof  Also even when fully rubbed in this seemed to leave my wifes skin a little whiter than other high quality mineral sunscreensAll in all we would buy this again,0.1,0.014,0.886,0.7362,Positive
So I have been using this for awhile now and it defines isnt the best sunscreen out there I mix it with my bb cream to even out the white cast and it works well in terms of sun protection BUT it does break ny face up in the most ridiculous little acne bumps so clearly it clogs pores Also after few hours I literally shine like a diamond lol Ut is fragrance free but I actually can smell some ingredients and its ok it doesnt smell like your typical sunscreen All in all I dont think Ill repurchase  but Ill definitely finish it,0.286,0.046,0.668,0.9842,Positive
This sunscreen is difficult to spread evenly on your face Its too white and can rub off onto your clothes Tried applying it on face many times but didnt look good at all So tried to use it on other body parts but it would just rub off Entire car seat is covered in this sunscreen after sitting on it Would not recommend,0.0,0.111,0.889,-0.7596,Negative
Definitely not the one for daily use it made me a completely different shade and the white cast is so hard to get rid of I will say tho it actually feels like my skin is protected against the sun but the way it lays on the skin is like a thick clay paste that smudges around and looks rlly streaky,0.139,0.023,0.838,0.7481,Positive
I have tried a lot of sunscreen products and I lean more towards mineral sunscreens in order to protect my skin from potentially harmful chemicals Honestly I would have returned this product if I could Its too greasy for my combination skin and the white cast on my olive tone skin is horrific Good for zombie makeup Ill save it for Halloween,0.167,0.103,0.73,0.5423,Positive
Super thick Didnt absorb at all after a bike ride in the sun I guess thats good because it stays on your face and makes a shieldThe bad thing is that it makes me look like a vampire sucked out all my blood and will shortly be joining the rigor mortis brigadeThis is not an everyday sunscreen for those with melanin,0.137,0.096,0.767,0.4215,Positive

Im Indian and have probably been sunburned 10 times in my life but still wear sunscreen often I bought this from the drugstore without testing it  BIG mistake A small amount of sunscreen can cover my face and body but it appears as if I smeared white paint all over myself It lightens my face in a way that looks similar to clown makeup Its very difficult to rub in and it feels more like its sitting on my face rather than rubbed in I dont want to waste the product or my money so Ill be using it when I go out on runs except it doesnt do well with sweat either  it collects in my elbow area after sweating Excited to finish this up and toss it,0.07,0.109,0.821,-0.6684,Negative

I absolutely loathe this stuff It is thick uncomfortable and beyond chalky I would take 1 drop and mix with 1 drop of foundation When I went to the dermatologist she would say Wow You wear a lot of makeup Um no Granted she was an idiot It was by far the WORST sunblock I have ever used on my face I cannot tell you to run away far enough By the way I am extremely fair skinned and it STILL made me look like I had clown paint on Horrible stuff,0.104,0.23,0.667,-0.9222,Negative
Tried this twice once by applying before leaving work for the day It was difficult to spread left streaky white cast and hate the smell I thought it might work better if I applied it right after doing my morning skincare with my skin freshly hydrated So I applied as the last step and it was slightly less difficult to spread Still left a streaky white cast still smelly I guess this gives you the best SPF because after you apply it youll want to put a bag over your head before you go out into the world,0.081,0.084,0.834,-0.0772,Negative
It works just like any other sunscreen but the white cast that it leaves when you have it on is AWFUL Im using quite a few CeraVe products and they are rather good but this sunscreen isnt something that I would ever recommend I know people who use Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer with SPF 35 and it works so much better in their opinion It also doesnt leave a white layer after applying so thats what Im buying next This CeraVe sunscreen just isnt worth the money that you pay,0.142,0.086,0.772,0.685,Positive

With so many ingredients placed into sunscreens these days its hard to know if you are actually getting protected from the sun or endangering yourself with applying so many chemicals Thankfully this sunscreen offers protection with natural minerals for sensitive skin and eliminates the guessing game for applying chemicals on your skin which are questionable It also allows for less drying and more moisture so it would be good for daily use not just beach and hiking time Its fragrancefree and paraben free so its a keeper,0.151,0.037,0.812,0.9014,Positive
This has all the good stuff you need To prevent the whitecaulkylook some people have wash your face as normal in the morning and leave a wet face Dont dry it Put on your thinnest products first ie serums then apply the thicker creams such as sunscreen Not only will you prevent any white look but it soaks into your skin better This locks in moisture Dont believe me try it Also ask your dermatologist if you should do it this way It worksThis is a great product Cerave is a must on any of their items,0.132,0.011,0.857,0.9091,Positive
CeraVe Hydrating Sunscreen 50 Face is another exceptional product  It contains both zinc oxide and titanium dioxide  It is oilfree fragrance free and chemical filter free I would not necessarily advise to wear under your makeup to work Yes it does leave a white cast This is for those of us who love to be outside and want safe reliable protection without harmful chemicals,0.24,0.016,0.744,0.9477,Positive
Hey I saw all the bad reviews and I think I can help So this sunscreen does have a brutal white casthowever if you put the sunscreen into your hands and rub it togetherbreaking it down AND THEN put it on your faceit reduces the white cast Ive also noticed that it has made my face so soft after the last couple weeks of using I love it,0.094,0.103,0.803,-0.1779,Negative
Ill admit when I was younger I only ever put sunscreen on my face when I went to the pool Now that Im getting older Im starting to regret that  I cant magically fix the damage thats already been done but I can work towards better skin from now on and I think this CereVe will help Its got good protection as a sunscreen goes on smooth and doesnt feel oily or anything and my face feels soft all day,0.15,0.07,0.781,0.8294,Positive
At first this looked like a sunscreen that gives that pale white clown face tint  Oh well  But after about two minutes it must have soaked into my skin a bit because that pallor went away  I looked normal  Went outside for about two hours worked fine  Didnt feel hot and sticky  Not something to wear under makeup but good for sports,0.145,0.0,0.855,0.81,Positive
This sunscreen goes on smooth and rubs in easily It stays put even on sunny and humid days without running into the eyes Although it is mineralbased it doesnt feel heavy or have a strong scentMost important it protects against burning without irritation and is gentle enough to reapply as needed And when your day is done it washes off cleanly  no clogged pores,0.241,0.029,0.729,0.9325,Positive
I like to use sunscreen under makeup especially for a few precancerous spots that I have This is a really good protective sunscreen but not quite light enough to disappear under makeup without some extra rubbing in For the beach or bicycling or walking in the sun this is great Recommended for outdoor use,0.198,0.04,0.762,0.8536,Positive

I put on sunscreen religiouslyI absolutely hate this sunscreen for its misleading hydrating nongreasy sellIts anything but hydrating I have dry skin and was looking for a sunscreen that would be hydrating while Im protecting my skin Well theres definitely no moisture coming out of my skin because I feel like I put on a thin layer of clay And yes I only used a small amountIts my own fault for not reading that there was zinc in here when I bought it I knew Id turn a little white but JESUS Im so whiteIdk wouldnt recommend it unless youre an avid outdoorsman Its not a daily thing to apply unless you enjoy the pasty clay lookMy poor eyebrows are saturated in this now,0.146,0.13,0.725,0.4927,Positive
I was really happy to see that there was a Cerave 50 SPF since I love the brand  But this one isnt for people of colour  These experts tell us  get a mineral sunscreen  So I got a mineral sunscreen  But this one isnt going to be for people with brown skin  It goes on smoothly and Im confident it works  But you are going to look terrible  I put it on my arm  It looks iridescent and chalky white at the same time  It dries down to grey  No it doesnt fade LOL  So if you want to look like a human being that isnt sickly dont use this on your face  And if you have brown skin unfortunately this isnt the solution  I have tinted sunscreens  colorescience but I really feel like those are makeup and it will rub off on clothes  Its unfortunate but Ill keep looking  Ill give these away to people that dont mind the white cast,0.104,0.151,0.746,-0.8925,Negative
In order to get the amount of sun protection stated on the bottle I would need Quite a bit of product Usually in my routine I apply sunscreen in a few layers with each layer being about a pea sized amount I spread across my face and neck This product left a white cast like no other sunscreen Ive used before I understand zinc oxide leaves more white cast than other types of sunscreen but this was very excessive Not only that it was difficult to spread across my face I love CeraVe and have used other products of theirs within my skincare routine and have to say I typically LOVE their products This one is a pass for me Ill be saving it for days I am home working in the yard and can tolerate such a dense white casted formula,0.099,0.059,0.842,0.836,Positive
I love that this product is not chemical sunscreen which causes breakout on my skin and contains simple great quality ingredients BUT it does leave a white cast It is so thick that my skin hardly absorbs it and it piles  flakes on my skin It also dries my skin  A LOT Overall I am disappointed There are better products in the market for this price,0.126,0.076,0.798,0.5499,Positive
This face sun protection cream is falsely advertised First of all the expiration date is in 3 months Second of all I applied it to my skin complexion and its not for my skin type  it turned my skin white my goal was not to get a whitening lotion if not a sun protection This sun protection cream is for Caucasia not for dark or tan skin complexion unless your goal is to get a skin whitening,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,Neutral
